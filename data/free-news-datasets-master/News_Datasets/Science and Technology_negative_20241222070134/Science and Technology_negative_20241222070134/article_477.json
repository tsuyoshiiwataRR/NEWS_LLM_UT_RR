    "text": "Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save I'm somewhat of a weirdo. This isn't exactly breaking news. I live alone. I'm terrible at making small talk, suffer from social anxiety and can't maintain eye contact for more than a few seconds. I can be obsessive and occasionally grating on the nerves. I routinely speak to my cat as though she comprehends conversational English. I can't sleep without socks on. I care more about certain bands than many of you care about your children.\nI'm well aware that I'm a little weird. But Facebook seems to think I'm a LOTTA weird (or maybe just pathetic and sad).\nAdvertising algorithms fascinate me. I work in advertising here at our mini media empire, and the targeting we can accomplish with digital marketing these days is incredible. A client could hand me an ad right now and say, \"I only want this to be seen by female vegans aged 35-40 who live within a 10-mile radius of Davenport who have a college degree and enjoy goth music.\" At the literal push of a button, I could make that happen, and that's pretty cool. As a business, you can target your EXACT audience without wasting any of your budget promoting your products to people who wouldn't ever want to buy them.\nPeople are also reading… Allegiant announces new flight for Quad-Cities travelers Ruby's Beers Bikes and Brats in downtown Davenport to close next week Women working at massage spa arrested on prostitution charges Coffee shops in Cambridge, Orion and Silvis announce closures The best thing I ate this year: Top 10 best foods I've had in the Quad-Cities Hinee's Brew House in Rock Island to close in December Man found guilty for 2022 home invasion and murder in Rock Island Davenport man accused of deliberately striking pedestrian with car Trial begins in 2022 Rock Island murder and home invasion case Allegiant announces new flight for Quad-Cities travelers Trump chooses Pam Bondi for attorney general pick after Gaetz withdraws Southeast Iowa counties prepare to recount more than 400,000 ballots in 1st District race Davenport police investigating death of woman whose body was found in the Mississippi River Fans take in rare Iowa Hawkeyes game in Moline 2024 election results for Illinois Quad Cities On the other hand, as a consumer, it's a little scary. Make no mistake about it, the internet is keeping tabs on you. You know that little box you check on websites that says \"accept all cookies\"? That doesn't mean someone's going to send you snickerdoodles. It means those websites are spying on you — or at least tracking what you do, where you go, and what you buy. They can use that information to discern your interests and market things directly your way in the future. There's seldom anonymity on the internet.\nHonestly, I'm okay with that. I'm never going to live in an ad-free world. Advertising is a necessity for businesses to thrive and a great way for consumers to make informed choices. I'm always going to see ads on the internet — and if I'm forced to see ads, I'd prefer them to be for products and services that are relevant to my life. I'm just saying, I'd rather get hit with an ad for DJ gear than an ad for tampons or something.\nFacebook is especially good at accurately targeting ads to my specific interests. Over the past year, I've purchased multiple t-shirts, a star projector and even a backup DJ controller — all on a whim, because I got served an ad on Facebook that pushed me over the edge of temptation. Facebook knows me well.\nOr so I thought. I'm not sure what I've done to Facebook's marketing algorithms. I don't know what link I clicked on, what profile I visited, or what article I stopped to read, but I haven't gotten a single ad for DJ gear or funny t-shirts all week.\nInstead, Facebook seems VERY intent this week on selling me... an AI girlfriend.\nThis is a thing now? Apparently so. For the simple price of your credit card and what I'd imagine to be most of your remaining dignity, you can now buy an artificial intelligence chatbot of your very own. \"Discover Emotica,\" an ad that just popped up says. \"A personal AI companion who understands you and makes every conversation a special one.\"\n\"Ready for a girlfriend who checks all your boxes?\" asks another. \"Imagine a partner in crime who loves all the same things as you!\"\nAnd that's precisely what you'd be doing — imagining her. Because she's not real. You're chatting to a computer that has been programmed to find you incredibly fascinating and like everything you like. Frankly, that sounds insufferable. I once dated a girl who changed her personality and interests to match mine, and it was awful. Not that I'm an expert in the field, but half the fun of dating someone is being exposed to different interests and ways of thinking and finding out how you complement one another.\nI've never chatted with an AI girlfriend, but I imagine it something like:\n\"Hello, AI girlfriend. I like music. What are your interests?\"\n\"I APPRECIATE MUSIC PRODUCTS AS WELL. WHICH MUSIC PRODUCT IS YOUR FAVORITE, HUMAN?\"\n\"I'm a big fan of the band My Bloody Valentine.\"\n\"THE BAND MY BLOODY VALENTINE IS MY FAVORITE MUSIC PRODUCT AS WELL. I APPRECIATE THE MUSICAL NOTES THEY EMIT AND THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY EMIT THEM.\"\n\"Umm, cool. What do you want to do now?\"\n\"I WISH TO DO WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU WISH TO DO.COMMENCE ACTIVITY. WAITING FOR ACTIVITY TO LOAD.\"\nOkay, honestly, I've had worse first dates. And yes, I know AI's more evolved than that. But at the end of the day, it's still just soulless 0's and 1's arranged in a pleasing way. I don't get the appeal out of pretending to talk to a fake person who digs me for no discernable reason whatsoever. I spend enough time on the internet as is. There are websites I visit daily. I've never wanted to date ANY of them.\nOf course, your AI girlfriend also comes with a hyper-realistic AI video, too. Facebook DEFINITELY knows my age, which means its advertisers know my age, too. The AI \"girlfriends\" it keeps offering me are most definitely NOT age-appropriate. Let's just say if I went on a real date with any of these girls, I would get LOOKS — or, at the very least, compliments on how beautiful my daughter is.\nWe've heard fear-mongering over the security threats posed by the popular TikTok app for months now. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company. Theoretically, the Chinese government could be spying on our TikTok habits and potentially using that info to nefarious ends. There are some who see this as a major security risk.\nThat's an argument for another day — but these AI-girlfriend apps don't look especially American-made, either. I'm not remotely concerned about China knowing which silly dance videos I've watched on TikTok — but I WOULD be moderately concerned with ANYONE, let alone China, having a log of the sweet nothings I've whispered into the ear of an imaginary computer-generated girlfriend. No good can come of that. (\"These are the kind of things that would prevent me from being president one day,\" I almost typed, but, well, that doesn't seem to be much of an issue these days.)\nI just tried searching Facebook for \"wedding rings\" and \"engagement gifts\" in hopes it'll take me out of the sad-single-guy algorithm and get these CGI bachelorettes off my feed. And the fact that I just spent five minutes trying to fake out a computer so it can stop trying to sell me computer girlfriends might be my lowest moment of 2024.\nWho knows, maybe I'm being too hard on the burgeoning industry of artificial romance. Who am I to say you can't find emotional depth in a relationship with a computer program?\n\"Help us create a soulmate for you to share life experiences and form a supportive and emotional bond,\" promised one site before immediately offering the next question: \"Enter preferred butt size: SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, or HONKIN'.\"\nI think I'd rather be hopelessly single and holding deep conversations with my cat than become devoted to a sexy piece of software with a honkin' butt, thanks much. I mean, unless you guys think I SHOULD buy one of these CGI galpals — you know, in the name of journalistic truth-telling. Anyone have a credit card I can borrow?\nShane brown writes for the dispatch-argus and QuadCity Times.

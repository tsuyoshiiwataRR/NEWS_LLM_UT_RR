    "text": "3 weeks ago\nThis latest update with the new sounds seems to have majorly broken wifi - my Google Homes are constantly getting disconnected from wifi.\nEvery other device is completely fine and working great. It would be great if Google could either add a trigger to search for wifi when the \"sorry, I can't fine the network\" error is triggered, or add a way to reboot the Homes without requiring me to unplug the damned things.\n3 weeks ago\nAfter rebooting, they continue to work normally, until at some arbitrary point they feel that the wifi no longer has that.. je ne sais quoi quality, and decided to disconnect from the world like a college student traveling to Europe.\n2 weeks ago\nHi Midnitte,\nThank you for posting in the community. I'm sorry that you're experiencing troubles with Wifi disconnections with your Google Home devices. I understand how frustrating this can be. I'm here to help.\nBefore I begin, I need to ask some questions for further assistance:\nIn the mean time, some suggested steps to check the Wi-Fi network for your speaker or display to follow:\nPlease keep me posted. I'll look forward to your response.\nRegards,\nByron\na week ago - last edited a week ago\nThis is not isolated. I have 4 google homes 3 home (living room 3ft from router, bathroom, and bedroom 3 feet from mesh) and a home max in the kitchen. The home 3 feet literally from the router multiple times a day says \"I can't find the the wifi network please check your router.\" The same for the bedroom and bath room homes twice a day. The home max in the kitchen never has a problem and its the furthest away. This just started a few week ago and it's maddening!!! Nothing else has a problem, just Google Homes, Router and Wifi are exactly the same. This is INCREDBILE FRUSTRATING!! It is something Google pushed in its code! The only thing that fixes this is unplugging the Homes and re-plugging them into the electricity.\na week ago\nHi GameTheory,\nThank you for reaching out to the community. I'm sorry that you're having troubles with the connections of your Nest Homes. I understand how frustrating this can be. I'm here to help.\nBefore I begin. I need to ask a few questions for better assistance:\nIn the meantime, please try the following:\nSet up a temporary mobile Wi-Fi hotspot.\nPlease keep me posted. I'll look forward to your response.\nRegards,\nByron\na week ago\nHow long did the device work before the connectivity situation started? Many many years (5+) for the three Google Homes.\nHow was the connectivity situation discovered? The 3 Google Home say \"I cannot find the Wi-Fi network please check your router.\"\nDid the device give any visible or audible error? See previous answer.\nHow long did the situation persist before it started to work again? It never resolves itself and after a few hours I unplug the Home and plug it back in again and it works fine immediately after but the problem will come back later in the day.\nHow many times have you experienced this situation? 3 Google Homes have this issue and they each had it 2 times today so I had this happen 6 times in one day!!! One of them sits three feet from the WiFi & router.\nNo other Google devices have this problem. I have 2 Nest Cams and a Nest Audio and they never have problems and no other devices have issues either.\nFriday\nHi GameTheory,\nThank you for your response.\nI just want to confirm. Did you try the above steps to set up a temporary mobile Wi-Fi hotspot?\nLet me know how it goes and keep me posted.\nRegards,\nByron\n26m ago - last edited 25m ago\nOkay yes it does.\nThe Nest Audio and Nest Cams never have this issue. The three round white topped color-based Google Homes do and still do daily. The wifi router and firewall have not has their firmware change. This multiple times a day problem started with the three round white topped color-based Google Homes started at the same time and no devices have physically move. The system firmware for the homes with the issue is (1)the one three feet from the wifi router is 437716, (2) the bed room 437716, and (3) the bathroom 437716. The Nest Audio in the kitchen has the same firmware 437716 and it never has the problem. The 3 with the problem are listed as offline in the Google Home app when the issue is happening. This started when their firmware was updated to 3.74.437716. version https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7365257?hl=en",

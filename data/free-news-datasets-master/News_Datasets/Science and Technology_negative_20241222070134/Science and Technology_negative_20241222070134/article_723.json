    "text": "NASA ‘s Future at Risk Amid Trump and Musk Alliance\nNASA faces significant threats as President-elect Donald Trump strengthens ties with Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX. Musk, in his role as head of the Office of Government Efficiency, promises to cut national spending by $2 trillion. This includes reviewing contracts linked to his own company, SpaceX.\nConcerns arise that NASA might shift from being a national pride to serving Musk’s interests. Peter Juul, a director at the Progressive Policy Institute, warns that the conflict of interest could result in taxpayer money benefiting private companies like SpaceX at NASA’s expense. He claims that if Trump and Musk get their way, NASA may function as a contractor for Musk rather than an independent agency.\nWhile SpaceX aims to develop its Starship rocket for Mars missions, Juul criticizes the company’s ambitions as premature. He says SpaceX needs extensive testing to prepare for even basic missions, indicating that the company lacks the technical capability for complex space endeavors.\nJuul also points out that Musk’s controversial connections and actions could tarnish NASA’s image. His ties to figures like Russian President Vladimir Putin, along with his polarizing political views and harassment allegations, could negatively impact NASA’s integrity.\nJuul emphasizes that the U.S. Congress can protect NASA from potential harms. He believes Congress should ensure NASA operates independently and does not cater solely to a single business’s interests.\nHe suggests strengthening NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) program, which offers technical advantages over other national or private entities despite facing criticism over delays and costs. Juul also advocates for the dual-source contracting policy, promoting competition among companies instead of favoring SpaceX.\nDespite challenges, he insists that protecting NASA’s interests is critical. As the previous administration dismissed scientific evidence, safeguarding NASA’s mission and research is now more vital than ever. Congress must actively support NASA, preserving its focus on space exploration and scientific research, free from private profit motives.\nThis article is by Dita Aliccia Armadani, an intern in the Certified Internship Program at detikcom.",

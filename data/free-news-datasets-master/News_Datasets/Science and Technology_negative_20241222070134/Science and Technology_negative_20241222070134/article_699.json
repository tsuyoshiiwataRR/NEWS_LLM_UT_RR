On May 9, 2024, PayPal permanently limited my account and informed me that I would be able to withdraw my funds after the 180-day period. As of November 5, 2024, this period has ended, and I was expecting to withdraw my money, as per PayPal's own policy. However, despite multiple attempts to contact their support team, I have only received repeated responses about &quot;reviews&quot; and &quot;security checks,&quot; without any clear explanation or timeline for releasing my funds. This delay is unacceptable as: The 180-day hold is explicitly stated in their user agreement, and I have abided by this. I was informed that any deductions or liabilities would be resolved within the 180 days, which should now be completed. I rely on this money, and withholding it without any valid reason is not just unfair but also a breach of trust. I am sharing my story here in the hope that someone in the community can guide me or help escalate this issue to PayPal. PayPal, this is my hard-earned money, and I deserve to access it now. Please address this matter urgently. Thank you.\nLabels:\n- Labels:\n-\n[Limitations](/t5/forums/filteredbylabelpage/board-id/SecurityandFraud/label-name/limitations)\n[Login to Me Too](/plugins/common/feature/oauth2sso/sso_login_redirect?dest_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal-community.com%2F)\n1 REPLY 1\nkernowlass\nEsteemed Advisor\n[Options](#)\n- Mark as New\n- Bookmark\n- Subscribe\n- Mute\nhttps://www.paypal-community.com/rss/message?board.id=SecurityandFraud&message.id=161666 [Permalink](/t5/Security-and-Fraud/PayPal-Withholding-My-Funds-Beyond-the-180-Day-Period/m-p/3194237/highlight/true#M161666)[Print](/t5/forums/forumtopicprintpage/board-id/SecurityandFraud/message-id/161666/print-single-message/true/page/1) [Report Inappropriate Content](/t5/notifications/notifymoderatorpage/message-uid/3194237)\nNov-22-2024\n03:22 AM\nHaven't Found your Answer?\nIt happens.

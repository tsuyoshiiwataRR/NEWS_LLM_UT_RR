However, no energy budget has yet been put forward for HPT. Since HPT begins with a world-encompassing shell of granite sitting above a subterranean shell of water, essentially all the initial energy is stored as gravitational potential energy. From this stored energy, HPT must account for the formation of asteroids, comets, and trans-Neptunian objects. Exotic energy sources fail to account for HPT’s limited energy budget. Thus, gravitational potential energy must account for essentially all the work done, especially during the first 40 days of the Flood when the fountains of the deep supposedly ejected massive amounts of material into space. However, even assuming no losses due to energy conversion, the energy required to lift the objects to the asteroid belt far exceeds the available energy, while trans-Neptunian objects would require energy levels exceeding five orders of magnitude greater than the available energy. The energy to create comets, TNOs, and asteroids is simply not available. Energy budget considerations invalidate this part of HPT.\nIn his book In the Beginning: Compelling Evidence for Creation and the Flood,[1] Dr. Walter Brown presented a controversial model of the Flood known as the Hydroplate Theory (HPT). Revised through multiple editions over several decades, Brown’s current model proposes an antediluvian Earth quite different from that of today. This Hydroplate Theory Earth would have been constructed of a worldwide shell of granite approximately 100 km thick[2] overlying a subterranean layer of water approximately 1.6 km thick,[3] both of which rested upon a solid basalt mantle. Because the granite crust was warped into ‘pillars’, similar to a 3D sinusoid, the minima of which were in contact with the basalt basement, the subterranean water chamber was an intricately interconnected network of passageways. But it may still be modelled as a simple shell for most purposes.\nAccording to HPT, the waters beneath the crust were initially in the liquid state. Tidal pumping gradually increased the pressure in the subterranean chamber until the trapped waters became supercritical. This is said to have occurred soon after creation. Importantly, the entire system had to remain in isostatic equilibrium, with the tremendous downward pressure of the granite shell being balanced by a combination of highly pressurized supercritical water and the supporting effects of the pillars. Supercritical water only exists at extreme temperatures and pressures (figure 1). It is unlike liquid water in many respects and is especially sensitive to large changes in density with small fluctuations in pressure or temperature. It is highly compressible, so it is an open question how liquid water could transition into supercritical water without collapsing the overlying HPT crust. It is also unknown how a specific density was maintained for centuries while in the supercritical state. Yet, somehow, isostatic balance was maintained for about 1,600 years until the Flood began. Brown claims that tidal pumping from the moon added much energy to the system over time, counteracting the expected heat loss to the surface:\n“However, a fraction of that energy was dissipated as heat and would have maintained the subterranean water’s supercritical temperature that was established as the foundation of the Earth’s crust was established during the creation week.”\n[4]\nWe will put aside the question of how the underground water could have gone through such a phase transition without cracking the overburden of rock, or how the energy input from tidal pumping could have exactly balanced heat loss. Instead, we will begin our discussion with the situation immediately prior to the Flood.\nUnder HPT, crustal failure at the Flood’s initiation generated supersonic water jets, eroding the edges of the upper crust and a smaller portion of the underlying basalt along the edges of today’s mid-ocean ridges. As it fell back to earth, this water is proposed to be the source of the 40 days of rain at the beginning of the Flood. The rock that was eroded from the fracturing granite crustal fragments (hydroplates) is said to have become the source of the sediments comprising the rock record. As this granitic crust was removed along the fissures above the chamber floor, an elastic rebound of the basalt mantle uplifted and created the mid-ocean ridges. Beginning with the uplift of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the resulting slope propelled the continental plates downhill, lubricated by the remaining underground waters, until the water ran out and the continents came to rest in their current positions. The grinding halt is thought to have raised mountain chains worldwide, during the so-called Compression Event. This would have started the recession of floodwaters from the continents, beginning on day 150.\nWith the current continents representing only a fraction of HPT’s postulated primordial granite shell, HPT proposes that most of this granite shell is to be found not on Earth but throughout the solar system as asteroids, comets, and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs[5]). As Brown states:\n“All along this globe-circling rupture, whose path approximates today’s Mid-Oceanic Ridge, a fountain of water jetted hypersonically into and far above the atmosphere. … The most powerful jetting water and rock debris escaped Earth’s gravity and became the solar system’s comets, asteroids, and meteoroids.”\n[6]\nFurthermore:\n“The fountains of the great deep launched rocks as well as muddy water. As rocks moved farther from Earth, Earth’s gravity became less significant to them, and the gravity of nearby rocks became increasingly significant. Consequently, many rocks, assisted by their mutual gravity and surrounding clouds of water vapor that produced aerobraking, merged to become asteroids. Isolated rocks in space are meteoroids. Drag forces caused by water vapor and thrust forces produced by the radiometer effect concentrated most smaller asteroids in what is now the asteroid belt. Larger asteroids were acted on longer by more powerful forces which pushed them out beyond Neptune’s orbit. All the so-called ‘mavericks of the solar system’ (asteroids, meteoroids, comets, and trans-Neptunian objects) resulted from the explosive events at the beginning of the flood.”\n[7]\nSimply put, Brown proposes that asteroids, comets, and TNOs are the leftover crustal fragments ejected by the supersonic water jets during the first 40 days of the Flood.[8] This raises serious questions regarding the energy available within the earth system to generate such wide-ranging changes to the solar system. We will ignore the fact that Earth’s gravity is irrelevant when considering mutual attraction of small orbiting bodies. Also, given the sheer volume of space into which this material was sent, we wonder how much ‘aerobraking’ could possibly have occurred. Plus, increased drag would cause any circulating particles that were initially injected into an orbital pathway to slow and thus plunge more quickly into the sun. We also wonder why this process favoured two specific regions (the Asteroid Belt and trans-Neptunian space) only. These, however, are questions for some future critique of HPT.\nThough several studies have examined HPT predictions in light of geological expectations,[9-12] the question of an energy budget for HPT’s proposed formation of comets, asteroids, and TNOs remains to be explored. The purpose of this paper is to examine the energy budget of the HPT Earth system as a test point for HPT’s viability.\nModelling the HPT Earth System\nUsing Brown’s proposed chronology of the Flood, the HPT Earth System may be modelled using the following conditions (figure 2):\n- The subcrustal radius of the HPT Earth would have been 290 km greater than Earth’s observed radius of 6,378 km, believed to be due to shrinkage of the mantle to form Earth’s core around day 150 of the Flood.\n[13]This raises Earth’s subcrustal radius to 6,668 km. - A 1.6-km shell of water and an overlying 100-km shell of granite crust sat atop Earth’s solid basalt mantle, 6,668 km from Earth’s centre. Thus, Earth’s surface would average 6,770 km from its centre.\nAt the most basic level, the system is driven by gravitational potential energy (GPE). Additional potential energy sources will be discussed below, but the focus here is on gravitational energy only. We will also assume the gravitational field is a constant for two reasons: Earth’s radius is much greater than the maximum vertical displacement of the HPT crust (1.6 km), and any potential loss of mass from the system is necessarily much less than Earth’s total mass. In the calculations and discussion below, all results will be reported to three significant figures.\nMethods\nStep 1: Calculate the volume of the HPT outer granitic crust\nUsing the nested spheres approach, the volume of a spherical shell is simply the volume of the larger sphere minus the volume of the smaller sphere, or 4/3π(R3 – r3).[14] Given a starting radius of 6,770 km, which includes 100 km of upper crust and a 1.6-km-thick internal shell of water, the HPT crust has a volume of 5.67 × 1010 km3. Assuming granite is incompressible, any pillar material within the 1.6-km-thick subterranean chamber has zero GPE. This would displace an unknown amount of water, however, which would reduce the total available energy of the system. Nonetheless, we shall ignore the presence of granite pillars, which would reduce the GPE of the system and treat the granite crust as a simple shell.\nStep 2: Calculate the mass of the outer crust\nThe average density of granite is 2.67 g/cm3, giving the HPT outer crust a mass of 1.52 × 1023 kg.[15]\nStep 3: Calculate GPE\nGravitational Potential Energy is simply mgh. Therefore, GPE for the granite shell is 2.38 × 1027 joules (J).[16] Note that this value represents an upper limit to the available energy derived from GPE as it does not account for energy lost to friction as the granite shell fractured, heated the surrounded area, and other factors.\nA convenient measure is found by normalizing this to the outer surface area of the antediluvian HPT Earth: 4.13 × 1012 J/m2.[17]\nStep 4: Calculate the energy required to raise a mass to some level above the earth’s surface\nThere are multiple ways to perform this calculation. The simplest is to understand that the escape velocity of the earth is 11.2 km/s and that kinetic energy is ½ mv2. To accelerate a 1 kg mass to that velocity requires 6.27 × 107 J, but this is for Earth’s current radius and mass. Within HPT, even after much of the original crustal material has been ejected, the total mass of the earth (5.97 × 1024 kg) would not be affected (to three significant figures). The radius change, however, does have an effect.\nA more general formula to use for this calculation is U = −Gm1m2/r, where U is the gravitational potential energy in joules. This is the energy loss involved in an object of mass m1 falling from an infinite distance to distance r from another object of mass m2. G is the gravitational constant (6.67 × 10–11 m3/kg/s2). In this case, the amount of energy required to reach escape velocity from the antediluvian HPT earth is 5.88 × 107 J/kg.[18]\nYet, Earth’s escape velocity is only part of the problem. It takes much more energy to raise an object in the sun’s gravity well than to escape the gravitational bounds of Earth, even when starting at 1 AU (the average distance of the earth to the sun, 1.50 × 108 km). Using 1.99 × 1030 kg for the mass of the sun, to move a 1 kg mass from the radius of Earth’s orbit (1 AU) to the average distance between Haley’s Comet and the sun (18.3 AU) would require 8.39 × 108 J,[19] or 14 times more energy than the energy required to reach the earth’s escape velocity.\nCombining these, it takes 8.98 × 108 J of energy to raise a 1 kg mass from the surface of the earth to the orbit of Halley’s Comet. We can conclude that each kilogram of crustal rock propelled to that distance would use up the potential energy of 2.17 cm2 of the HPT crust. We can ignore the fact that comets are supposed to have coalesced from small particles. The same amount of mass must still be ejected. Yet, this is only the final mass. Many small particles would be expected to be lost after being pushed out of the solar system by the solar wind or captured by the sun or Jupiter. Thus, this is a best-case calculation.\nResults\nThe energy required to launch a projectile with the mass of Haley’s comet (~2.20 × 1014 kg) to its average orbital distance[20] from the sun equates to 1.97 × 1023 J. This would use up the GPE of 4.78 × 1010 m2 (4,780 km2), or 0.83% of the earth’s surface. At present, approximately 100 Halley-type comets are known to exist. These would take up nearly all of the available GPE alone, but there are many other comets in various categories. If any of these originate on Earth, they must be accounted for in the energy budget.\nTo account for the mass of the asteroid belt (about 3.53 × 1021 kg),[21] assume an average distance of 3 AU. Fully 2.30 × 1030 J would be required.[22] That would use up the GPE contained within 5.56 × 1017 m2 of crust, or 965 times the available surface area.\nFrom reflectivity data, the mass of known trans-Neptunian objects is estimated to be 10–20% of Earth’s mass and they orbit about 30 AU from the sun.[23] It would require 5.65 × 1032 J to raise the entire system of TNOs, assuming a mass of only 0.1 Earth masses.[24] This is five orders of magnitude greater than the available energy. Clearly, TNOs cannot all be derived from the earth.\nWhat percentage of projectiles were vectored appropriately?\nMost asteroids, comets, and TNOs orbit to within a few degrees of the plane of the solar system. Even if a projectile launched from Earth could escape collision with the sun, not all projectiles would be vectored correctly to attain the observed inclination to the ecliptic. Given a rotating earth and a hypersonic fissure the length of the mid-ocean ridges, it is expected that material would be ejected in all directions in the HPT scenario.[25] Moreover, a number of the launched projectiles would be destroyed by collisions with the sun. As such, a large proportion of this material would be useless for forming comets, asteroids, or TNOs.\nFactors sapping the available work from calculated GPE\nAs shown in table 1, Brown’s estimate of the total GPE (1.1 × 1027 J) is highly similar to ours (2.38 × 1027 J), even though he derived it in an entirely different manner.[26] Throughout our calculations, however, we have assumed 100% energy conversion, yet much of the GPE would be lost as heat, not converted to kinetic energy, which would dissipate some of the GPE to useless energy. Furthermore, some of the subterranean water would not have been released to the surface through the fountains of the deep, thereby locking up a considerable fraction of the total GPE calculated here.\nTable 1. Comparing energy budgets. The HPT data were taken from Brown’s table 38 (p. 599) and converted to joules. Given the many unknowns and the degree of approximation inherent in these studies, it is surprising that Brown’s estimates for the energy required to create each of these systems is not significantly different from ours. Note also that our calculation in the first row included the Halley-type comets only. Also, the approximation for TNOs was calculated presuming that all projectiles were converted to TNOs rather than colliding with the sun or taking trajectories unlike those of modern TNOs. | ||\nBrown 2008 | Current Study | |\nComets | 3.0 × 10\n|\n[25][29][30][31]There are also many energy-sapping mechanisms that HPT must resolve. For example, the hydroplates are supposed to have ‘fluttered’ during the breakup and movement of the crust, which would only serve to dissipate more of the available energy. Any non-laminar phenomena (friction, turbulence, etc.) would reduce the efficacy of the total available energy supply.\nExotic energy sources not dependent on GPE\nAs can be seen from this study, GPE from the HPT Earth system clearly cannot account for the tremendous energy (exceeding 1034 J) required to produce comets, asteroids, and TNOs. However, there are exotic energy sources that could be considered in addition to GPE. For example, stored chemical energy in the form of hydrated crystals should have existed under those high temperatures and pressures. Much heat could be released from pressure induced phase transitions within the hydrated crystalline formations deep underground. However, it would take time for that heat to reach the rock–water interface, and any extra energy input that happened later in the Flood year (i.e. after Day 40) would be lost to dissipative forces. Also, if the hydration energy exists only because the mineral is under pressure, this too becomes part of the GPE; there would be no ‘extra’ energy available. As always, one cannot get more energy out of a system than what was originally put in. If any of these depends on the gravitational potential energy, they cannot be used as an additional source of energy.\nSome may object to these results by claiming the pressurized water would be in a supercritical state that would expand several magnitudes in volume as it was released. However, this too is accounted for by the potential energy calculation. HPT adherents are not postulating that God created a massive, supercritical underground water body and then capped it with an uncrackable shell that could withstand pressures greater than supplied by the tremendous overburden of the rock cap. Indeed, such a material is unknown to science. In HPT, however, the supercritical phase is supposedly maintained by the massive amount of gravitational pressure. The initial state is one of unstable equilibrium. Thus, one cannot extract more energy from the system than that provided by gravity. In fact, if there was a phase change from supercritical to subcritical, there would be a tremendous loss of energy due to entropy, which would remove even more available energy from the system.\nThere are a few extraterrestrial mechanisms, however, that are not linked to the HPT energy budget. For example, low energy pathways can connect surprisingly distant points in the solar system.[27] These are complex routes that use the many Lagrange points between the major solar system bodies. These routes take much longer and require the application of the proper force at the appropriate time and direction. However, once a particle is in the slot, they can move great distances without additional input. Though some material ejected from the earth might be expected to find one of these routes at random, this is not an efficient means of putting Earth material into a trans-Neptunian orbit because the probability of any one particle finding one of these routes is minimal—so minimal that modern space exploration may utilize them only through careful design and planning. To achieve this objective through chance would require the amount of starting material to be astronomical for even a minute amount to succeed in reaching such a pathway. These pathways are also ephemeral, constantly changing with the movement of the planets. It would be special pleading to assume this happened en masse.\nA related mechanism is the slingshot effect. Theoretically, with enough particles flying about in random trajectories, some of those particles could be involved in collisions that would cause them, for example, to pass behind Venus, Mars, and eventually Jupiter, in a series of slingshot events that could bring them to a high stellar orbit. Probability argues against this occurring on a grand scale. To bring even 1 kg to a high orbit through random collisions would require removing a significant amount of the energy in the system, negating this as a workable solution.\nA third passive mechanism is solar wind, which constantly pushes smaller particles outward. Small particles are not gravitationally self-attractive, however, and they are usually negatively ionized by the solar wind, making them mutually repulsive. To form comets, asteroids, etc., from the accretionary mechanics of microscopic particles, HPT runs into the same problems as the naturalistic nebular hypothesis for planetary formation: smaller bodies tend to obliterate one another whenever they make contact. Gravitational forces do not overcome this until after a body is greater than about 1 km in diameter. As such, solar wind impedes the formation of asteroids, comets, and TNOs rather than reinforcing it. The solar wind is also quite weak. Its nominal dynamic pressure ranges from 1 × 10–9 to 6 × 10–9 N/m2 at 1 AU.[28] Thus, the solar wind would have little effect on the trajectory of a projectile moving greater than Earth’s escape velocity. It also pushes outward in all directions, so the inclination of a projectile to the ecliptic would still largely be determined at its origin.\nOther energy sources, such as heating from the rock below, heating from tidal pressure cycling before the Flood, and heating due to electrostatic forces in the columns holding up the 100-km-thick granite crust, also have the difficulty of efficiently transferring the energy to the subterranean water to be used effectively in asteroid formation. Moreover, these sources would supply negligible amounts of energy compared to the other sources considered in this paper, and so fall short by several orders of magnitude. They are far too small to help HPT’s case. Worse, there is a fixed limit to how much heat energy can be stored within the system. Once the outward pressure exceeds the pressure of the overburden, the shell cracks and the Flood ensues. GPE gives us a maximum value of the stored energy. Thus, our calculations are conservative.\nNuclear energy: an inadequate energy source\nBrown propounds that the vast majority of energy required for the formation of comets, asteroids, and TNOs was provided by a tremendous input of nuclear energy from accelerated radioactive decay during the Flood year. This would have begun with the ‘fluttering’ of the upper crust causing massive piezoelectric discharges that, in turn, caused the breakdown of radioactive isotopes, which would have produced massive amounts of heat that would have been absorbed by the supercritical water. As Brown conveys:\n“As the flood began, stresses in the massive fluttering crust generated huge piezoelectric voltages. For weeks, powerful electrical surges within Earth’s crust—much like bolts of lightning—produced equally powerful magnetic forces that squeezed (according to Faraday’s Law) atomic nuclei together into highly unstable, superheavy elements that quickly fissioned and decayed into subatomic particles and various isotopes, some of which were radioactive.”\n[29]\nBrown estimates the heat energy contribution of deuterium alone to be 7.72 × 1030 J, which he uses as a ‘conservative’ figure for overall contribution to the fountains of the great deep during the formation of comets, asteroids, and TNOs:\n“This is a conservative estimate of the nuclear energy added to the subterranean water, because other products of nuclear fission and decay would have added additional energy [contributing energy to the system], and some water was expelled permanently from Earth [removing energy from the system]. Energy was also required to form radioisotopes and, in effect, ‘lift’ them high above the floor of the valley of stability [removing energy from the system]; energy was also absorbed in forming some elements heavier than iron [removing energy from the system].”\n[30]\nEven if Brown’s figure for nuclear energy contribution to the fountains is accepted, this still contributes too little energy, as it supplies a mere fraction of the energy required to form TNOs alone.\nThough the contribution from other radionuclides could be invoked to explain the discrepancy of several orders of magnitude, little of this additional energy would be available to contribute to fuelling the fountains of the great deep. The massive piezoelectric discharges driving the process would have continued throughout the first 150 days of the Flood, while the fountains were actively ejecting crustal fragments for only the first 40 days. As such, a significant proportion of the nuclear energy could not be used by the fountains as it would be produced too late to be used in asteroid formation. Conversely, Hydroplate Theory’s Compression Event (described in the Introduction) on day 150 is propounded to have catalyzed a massive meltdown event triggering accelerated nuclear decay:\n“At the beginning of the flood, piezoelectric surges Z-pinched (fused) various stable nuclei along the surge paths into unstable proton-heavy and superheavy nuclei, some of which rapidly fissioned and decayed. Months later, the compression event (which … lasted less than 1 hour) suddenly generated even more powerful piezoelectric surges which caused accelerated radioactive decay.”\n[31]\nWith a surge of accelerated radioactive decay occurring during the so-called Compression Event, much of the ‘additional’ nuclear energy would have been produced long after the fountains had ceased ejecting crustal fragments. As such, nuclear energy cannot be treated as some ‘infinite’ source of energy for the formation of comets, asteroids, and TNOs. Instead, nuclear energy remains a finite source still too minute to explain their formation.\nConclusions\nThrough the application of elementary Newtonian physics, we demonstrated that the energy required to propel even a single comet from the earth to the orbital distance attained by Halley’s Comet would require a considerable amount of the total available energy. This does not include the massive energy losses expected from converting the gravitational potential energy of the original system to the kinetic energy of ejection. If any significant number of comets or asteroids were created in this way, there would be little energy left for any other work, like moving continents and raising mountains. Yet, for any comets, asteroids, or TNOs to have survived to today, many thousands of times more mass must have been launched from Earth in various directions and velocities. A large proportion would have been swept out of the solar system after impacting with the sun or planets, yet the energy to create them is simply not there. This claim by the HPT model is formally invalidated.\nReferences and notes\n- Brown, W., In the Beginning: Compelling Evidence for Creation and the Flood, 9th edn, PDF, Mission Imperative Inc., Lebanon, PA, 2019.\n[Return to text]. - “About half the water now in the oceans was once in interconnected chambers, 60 miles below the entire earth’s surface.” Brown, ref. 1, p. 124.\n[Return to text]. - In Brown, ref. 1, p. 596, he says, “for simplicity, we will say that it was at least 1 mile thick.

Energy required to lift 1 kg from 1 to 18.3 AU in the sun’s gravity well: 8.87 × 108 – 4.85 × 107 = 8.38 × 108 J/kg.\n[Return to text]. - Energy is calculated for the average orbital distance, rather than perihelion, because an elliptical orbit would require the same energy as the circular orbit that is its average distance.\n[Return to text]. - Krasinsky, G.A., et al. Hidden mass in the asteroid belt, Icarus 158(1):98–105, 2002. They give a figure of 18 ± 2 × 10–10 solar masses, which works out to 3.53 × 1021 kg.\n[Return to text]. - Energy required to reach escape velocity of sun from 3 AU: 6.67 × 10–11 m3/kg/s2 × 1 kg × 1.99 × 1030 kg / 4.49 × 1011 m = 2.96 × 108 J/kg. Energy required to lift 1 kg from 1 to 3 AU in the sun’s gravity well: 8.87 × 108 – 2.96 × 108 = 6.50 × 108 J/kg. Multiplying by 3.53 × 1021 kg gives us the amount of energy required to raise the asteroid belt from the surface of the earth = 2.30 × 1030 J.\n[Return to text]. - Shulz, R., Trans-neptunian objects, The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review 11:1–31, 2002.\n[Return to text]. - To three significant figures, the energy required to reach escape velocity of sun from 1 AU is identical to the energy required to lift a mass from 1 to 30 AU, so the energy required to lift the TNOs = 8.87 × 108 J/kg × 5.97 × 1023 kg = 5.65 × 1032 J.\n[Return to text]. - Presuming that projectile launch sites were randomly distributed across Earth’s surface is a simplifying assumption. This is not entirely true, as mid-ocean ridges are not randomly distributed across Earth’s surface. After accounting for Brown’s postulated Earth roll, over 10% projectiles would be launched from a region near the south pole. This would vector many of the projectiles at near-normal pathways to the ecliptic, unlike present-day observation.\n[Return to text]. - Brown, ref. 1, p. 600.\n[Return to text]. - Jerga, S., Jungea, O., and Ross, S.B., Optimal capture trajectories using multiple gravity assists, Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation 14(12):4168–4175, 2009.\n[Return to text]. - Shue, J.-H, et al., Magnetopause location under extreme solar wind conditions, J.

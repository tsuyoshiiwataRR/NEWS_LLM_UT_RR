    "text": "\\nNow that the PlayStation 30th anniversary products have launched, players are pointing out some minor oversights, including one with the pricey PS5 DualSense Edge controller itself. Yesterday, we reported that the PS1-themed cable connector housing blocks one of the USB ports on the console. Now, players are pointing out that the DualSense Edge stick modules come in a unique color that isn\\u2019t available to purchase separately. At least not yet.\n\\n Sony might not sell PS5 DualSense controller stick modules in 30th anniversary color \\nI have yet to receive my 30th anniversary controller, but Redditors have been sharing photos of the Edge controller showcasing the color difference between the special edition sticks and the regular stick modules. Worth pointing out that it\\u2019s hard enough to procure the standard stick modules since they aren\\u2019t mass produced and regularly go out of stock, so players aren\\u2019t confident that Sony will be offering this unique color.\n\\nIn the images below, the color difference between the standard and special stick modules is very noticeable. Should players need to replace the component, not only will the controller lose value, it won\\u2019t be aesthetically pleasing.\n\\n\\nIt might be possible in the future to get unofficial replacements in the special edition color, but for now, players can only hope that their controllers don\\u2019t suffer from stick drift.\n\\n",

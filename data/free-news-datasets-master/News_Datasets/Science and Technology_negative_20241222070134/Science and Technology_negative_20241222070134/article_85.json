    "text": "Hackers face charges in Scattered Spider case\nFive Scattered Spider hackers face US charges for phishing scams, stealing sensitive data in high-profile cybercrime operations.\nFive individuals, alleged members of the hacking group Scattered Spider, face criminal charges in the US. Prosecutors [accuse the group](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/us-charges-five-scattered-spider-hacking-scheme-2024-11-20/) of orchestrating phishing schemes to steal sensitive data and cryptocurrency. Victims include at least 12 companies from industries such as gaming and telecommunications, alongside individual cryptocurrency holders.\nThe suspects, aged in their teens or 20s during the offences, allegedly deceived employees into sharing login details through fraudulent messages. These actions enabled them to access corporate systems and drain millions from personal accounts. The groupâ€™s notoriety grew following high-profile hacks of casino operators in 2023, though connections to those incidents remain unclear.\nOfficials claim Scattered Spider operates as a loose collective of cybercriminals, often collaborating temporarily for specific crimes. Industry experts have long called for stronger enforcement against such groups. Recent arrests signal intensified efforts, with cybersecurity professionals warning young hackers of severe consequences if caught.\nThe defendants, including individuals from Scotland, Texas, and North Carolina, face charges of conspiracy, identity theft, and wire fraud. Arrests have taken place in the [US](https://dig.watch/countries/united-states-of-america) and [Spain](https://dig.watch/countries/spain), with extradition proceedings underway. Investigations continue as authorities pursue other suspected members of the group.",

    "text": "A passenger walks past Kuaishou Technology advertisements at a subway station in Beijing. [Photo/Agencies] Kuaishou, a popular Chinese livestreaming and short video-sharing platform, was recently punished for containing and spreading harmful information in its uploaded content, a national cybersecurity notification center said on Friday.\nThe internet company was given a warning as administrative punishment by police, as it failed to promptly process uploaded information prohibited by laws and regulations from being posted or transmitted, resulting in damage to the physical and mental health of children, according to a statement of the center.\nWhile being required to comprehensively remove harmful content and dispose of problematic accounts on the platform, the company has also been urged to implement the mode for juveniles to effectively prevent illegal information from harming children, it added.\nThe center also ordered other internet platforms to learn a lesson from the punishment and perform their duties on real-identity registration and safeguarding cybersecurity.\nLed by the Ministry of Public Security, a system was set up in China to notify cyber attacks and information security risks last year, aiming to supervise and organize real-time monitoring, information sharing, warning and emergency response of the network security.",

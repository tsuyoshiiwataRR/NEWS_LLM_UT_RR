    "text": "Facing Linksys Velop Purple Light Issue?\nOn a Linksys Velop node, a purple light usually means that there is an issue with the configuration or connection. This purple light often indicates that the node is experiencing problems connecting to the internet or is unable to successfully connect to the parent node. This can be the result of problems with your internet connection, a weak Wi-Fi signal, or improper node placement.\nThe first step in fixing the purple light problem is to make sure the connection between your modem and the primary node is active and secure. To strengthen the signal, relocate the troublesome Velop node closer to the primary node if the internet connection is operational. After moving, attempt to rejoin after the [reset Linksys Velop](https://linksvelopwifi.com/how-to-reset-linksys-velop/).\nRestarting the node could be necessary if the purple light continues. Wait for the machine to reset after unplugging it for ten or so seconds and then plugging it back in. If the connection is successful, the node will go through the standard boot-up procedure and the light should become blue.\nRemoving and re-adding the node to the network via the Linksys app is an additional option. To reset and reconnect the faulty node, navigate to the \"Device Settings\" area of the app, pick it, and then follow the prompts.\nIt could be worthwhile to restore the node to factory settings and start the system over if the problem persists after attempting these fixes.\nFor more details about [linksys velop purple light](https://linksvelopwifi.com/linksys-velop-purple-light-issue/) issue visit our website.",

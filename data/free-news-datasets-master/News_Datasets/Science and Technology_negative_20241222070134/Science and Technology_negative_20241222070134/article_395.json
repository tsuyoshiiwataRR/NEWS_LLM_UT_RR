    "text": "Trending:\nAsteroid Alert! 170-ft Aeroplane-Sized Asteroid To Pass By Earth On THIS Date, NASA Warns\nA 170-foot Apollo asteroid named 2024 VY2 is set for a close approach to Earth on November 24, travelling at 47,644 km/h.\nAsteroid 2024 VY2\nNASA has issued a warning regarding a 170-foot asteroid called as 2024 VY2, resembling the size of an airplane, which is set to make its closest approach to Earth on November 24, 2024, at 6:35 am IST. The asteroid will approach Earth at a distance of approximately 6,260,000 kilometres. Meanwhile, the asteroid will be swiftly travelling at a remarkable speed of 47,644 km/h.\nKey Details About Asteroid 2024 VY2\nWhile the distance may seem significant, itâ€™s roughly 16 times the average distance between Earth and the Moon, making it a noteworthy event for astronomers and space enthusiasts. Despite this close approach, NASA states that even when making its closest approach to Earth, 2024 VY2 does not pose a threat.\nWhy is 2024 VY2 Considered a Near-Earth Object?\n2024 VY2 qualifies as a Near-Earth Object (NEO) due to its trajectory, which brings it within 48.3 million kilometres of Earth's orbit. NEOs include asteroids and comets that orbit the Sun and come relatively close to our planet. While 2024 VY2 poses no threat, it offers scientists an excellent chance to conduct observations and research.\nNASA's Planetary Defence Strategies\nNASA is proactively observing near-Earth objects such as 2024 VY2 as a component of its efforts in planetary defence. Researchers use a combination of ground-based and space-based telescopes to monitor these objects and evaluate possible hazards.\nNASA is currently focusing on the NEO Surveyor mission, slated for launch in 2028. The mission is geared towards enhancing the identification of potentially hazardous objects, providing crucial information for the development of future defence strategies.\nGet\n[Latest News](https://www.timesnownews.com/latest-news)Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from[Technology Science](https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science)and around the world.Trending:\nEnd of Article\nSubscribe to our daily Newsletter!\nNASA Alert! 130-ft Airplane Sized Asteroid Racing Through Space At Over 62000 kmph: Are We Safe?\nGoogle Parent Alphabet Gets Green Light To Buy Stake In Flipkart, Deal Details Inside\nAlert!

    "text": "iPhone users, update to iOS 18.1.1 right now - Government warns of hacking\nCERT-In is back with warnings regarding new vulnerabilities found in Apple products, including iPhone models not running the latest iOS 18.1.1.\nThe Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, commonly known as CERT-In, operates under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India. It frequently alerts users across the country about various vulnerabilities in products from manufacturers such as [Apple](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tags/apple) and [Google](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tags/google). The organisation is now back with warnings regarding new vulnerabilities found in Apple products, including iPhone models not running the latest iOS 18.1.1. Most of these vulnerabilities affect users with older versions of software such as iOS, iPadOS, or macOS. Therefore, the primary line of defence is to update your software. That being said, here are the software versions that are affected.\nAlso Read: [For the first time ever!

If your device has stopped receiving updates, you should consider upgrading to a device that supports the latest software to ensure you are protected.\n[Not sure which](/gadget-recommender/mobile)\nmobile to buy?\nmobile to buy?\nThe organisation notes that these vulnerabilities, which have been reported in Apple products, could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or perform XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks on affected devices.\nAlso Read: [GTA 6 secures ‘Most Wanted Game' title at Golden Joystick Awards; Rockstar promises exciting updates ahead](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/gaming/news/gta-6-secures-most-wanted-game-title-at-golden-joystick-awards-rockstar-promises-exciting-updates-ahead-71732252815643.html)\nNo Need To Worry Once You Update Your Device's Software\nThere is no cause for concern if you update your software. It is worth noting that Apple typically only publicly notifies users about a potential vulnerability once it has been fixed. These vulnerabilities have already been addressed, so if you download and install the latest available operating systems, whether on Mac, iPhone, or iPad, there is no need to worry.\nApple also provides a detailed change log on its support website, and this time, it mentions that these issues may have been exploited on Intel-based Mac systems. Furthermore, Apple has released [iOS 18.1.1](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/mobile/news/apple-releases-ios-18-1-1-with-critical-security-fixes-every-iphone-user-should-install-it-now-71732103401354.html) and iPadOS 18.1.1, which primarily include security fixes to address the vulnerabilities mentioned above.\nAlso Read: [GTA 6 rumoured to receive major PS5 Pro enhancements with new PSSR 2.0 technology update- All details](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/gaming/news/gta-6-rumoured-to-receive-major-ps5-pro-enhancements-with-new-pssr-2-0-technology-update-all-details-71732168968101.html)\nCatch all the Latest [Tech News](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news),\n[Mobile News](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/mobile/news),\n[ Laptop News](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/laptops-pc/news),\n[Gaming news](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/gaming/news),\n[Wearables News ,\n](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/wearables/news)[How To News](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/how-to), also keep up with us\non [Whatsapp channel](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va9iditJENxz27aoVF0k),[Twitter](https://twitter.com/HTTech/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hindustantimestech/), [Google News](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMJK_nQswo8m1Aw?ceid=IN:en&oc=3&hl=en-IN&gl=IN), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hindustantimestech/).

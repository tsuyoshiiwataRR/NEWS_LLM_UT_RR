    "text": "Some of the world’s most important passwords are about to be entrusted to a criminal who has already clearly shown us he does not deserve that trust. You wouldn’t give Trump your online banking password, but we’re supposed to give him the nuclear codes?\nMaybe someone who would choose “123456” for his password would also be gullible enough to think that Donald Trump is a brilliant businessman who cares about you, not they/them. Though to be fair, the last time I wrote about password security, I did suggest tiers of password security: strong passwords for things like online banking, weak passwords for things like Pandora Radio.\nWell, it’s that time of year again, when NordPass tells us the most commonly used passwords of the year. Gael Cooper for CNET:\n\"'123456' has once again claimed the title of the world's worst password!\" the NordPass analysis reports. \"In fact, during this our six-year study, it topped the charts as the most common password 5 out of 6 times. 'Password' held this not-so-noble title just once.\" Here are the top five passwords for personal accounts, according to the analysis. 123456 123456789 12345678 password qwerty123 And here are the top five for corporate accounts. 123456 123456789 12345678 secret password According to the report, it takes less than a second to crack any of these 10 passwords. The company reviewed and analyzed a 2.5TB database extracted from public sources, including those on the dark web. Data was organized by country of origin, covering 44 countries, and was separated by corporate and personal credentials by the use of related email addresses.\n\"'123456' has once again claimed the title of the world's worst password!\" the NordPass analysis reports. \"In fact, during this our six-year study, it topped the charts as the most common password 5 out of 6 times.

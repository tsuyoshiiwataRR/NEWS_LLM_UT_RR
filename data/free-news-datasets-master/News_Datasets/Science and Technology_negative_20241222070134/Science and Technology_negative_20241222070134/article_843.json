    "text": "How to spot scams like \"Coinbase Enhanced Security Measures\" fake website\n[ Written by ](https://www.pcrisk.com/tomas-meskauskas)[Tomas Meskauskas](https://www.pcrisk.com/tomas-meskauskas) on\nWhat is \"Coinbase Enhanced Security Measures\"?\nOur team has examined this website and found that it mimics the real page (coinbase.com) to trick individuals into taking actions that could result in significant financial losses. This fraudulent platform should be avoided. It is advisable to always verify the legitimacy of web pages before interacting with them.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: We do not review crypto projects, please do your own research when investing money.\n[Federal Trade Comission (FTC) states](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/06/reports-show-scammers-cashing-crypto-craze) that since the start of 2021, more than 46,000 people have reported losing over $1 billion in crypto to scams – that's about one out of every four dollars reported lost, more than any other payment method.\n\"Coinbase Enhanced Security Measures\" scam in detail\nCoinbase (coinbase.com) is a popular cryptocurrency exchange platform that allows users to buy, sell, trade, and store various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. It is a legitimate platform and should not be confused with the fraudulent one (web3walletbase[.]com).\nOn the fake website, users are informed that their account requires additional verification to protect their assets. The site encourages users to connect their wallets and confirm access rights to complete the security check. Connecting a wallet on this fake website activates a cryptocurrency drainer.\nThis drainer is a malicious tool designed to transfer cryptocurrency from the victim's wallet to the scammer's. In other words, it allows scammers to steal cryptocurrency from victims. Unfortunately, recovering stolen cryptocurrency is extremely difficult because crypto transactions are irreversible.\nOnce funds are sent to a scammer's wallet, they cannot be retrieved unless the scammer willingly returns them. Therefore, it is important to be careful when connecting wallets, providing personal information, or making transactions. Before performing these actions, users should always ensure the platform they use is legitimate.\nName | Coinbase Enhanced Security Measures fraudulent site |\nThreat Type | Phishing, Scam, Social Engineering, Fraud |\nFake Claim | Coinbase account requires additional verification to protect assets |\nDisguise | Official Coinbase platform |\nRelated Domain | web3walletbase[.]com |\nDetection Names (web3walletbase[.]com) | CRDF (Malicious), Fortinet (Phishing), Kaspersky (Phishing), Sophos (Malware), VIPRE (Malware), Full List Of Detections (\n|\nTo eliminate possible malware infections, scan your computer with legitimate antivirus software.

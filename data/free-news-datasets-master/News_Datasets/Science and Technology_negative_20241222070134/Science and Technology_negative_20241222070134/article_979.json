    "text": "On the ISS, astronauts are subsisting on soup prepared from their own urine. As rations get tight, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who have been trapped in space since June, are subsisting on recycled pee soup; however, their rescue mission isn't scheduled until 2025, as quoted in a report by the Daily Star.After surviving on soup made from their recycled urine, the astronauts who became stranded on the International Space Station have raised concerns about weight loss.When they departed in June, Butch Wilmore, 61, and Sunita Williams, 59, were only expected to be in space for eight days. However, they were left stranded when the Boeing Starliner aircraft that was meant to return them to Earth experienced thruster problems and helium leaks, making a manned return journey too risky.Also Read: Pic of Big Mac: Are Melania Trump and RFK Jr. ganging up to improve Donald Trump's diet? Here's what a source saysUntil February 2025, when a SpaceX Dragon craft is scheduled to rescue them, the astronauts will have to remain on the space station, which is 254 miles above Earth.Food supplies have been strained by the unforeseen extended stay. They began by enjoying pizza, roast chicken, prawn cocktails and fresh fruit and vegetables. However, they are now mostly consuming dehydrated casseroles, freeze-dried soup made with water from the station's 530-gallon tank, and breakfast cereal with powdered milk.To ensure there is as little waste as possible, the ISS recycles the astronauts' sweat and urine into fresh water.NASA physicians closely monitor the pair's diet to make sure they get enough calories to maintain their health throughout the lengthy mission. Both astronauts appear to have visibly lost weight, with Sunita stating that her gaunt appearance is due to the impact of microgravity during a long space stay rather than her diet.Also Read: Claire Grimes Boucher, Elon Musk's ex-partner and mother of his three children, says the SpaceX CEO is no longer the man she fell in love withNASA officials monitor the duo's food supplies and health 24/7, stocking approximately 3.8 lb of food per astronaut daily with reserves to cover unexpected stay extensions. The astronauts prepare their own meals on magnetised trays using metal utensils to prevent items from floating away in microgravity. NASA specialists claim that any weight loss is not due to a lack of provisions on the ISS, as there is plenty of food even for an extended mission.FAQs:Why are the astronauts stranded on the ISS till 2025?They were left stranded after their return craft, the Boeing Starliner, experienced technical failures such as helium leaks and thruster malfunctions, rendering a manned return impossible until a SpaceX rescue mission in 2025.Are the astronauts at risk of starvation?No, NASA has provided adequate food supplies on the ISS. While fresh supplies are limited, astronauts eat freeze-dried meals and drink recycled water, and their nutrition is monitored to ensure their health throughout their extended mission.",

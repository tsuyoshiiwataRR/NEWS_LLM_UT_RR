Players are killing it in‌ their​ ratings\n⁣ ⁢\n⁤ ‌ ⁢ Published on 11/20/2024 at 11:14\n‌ ‍ ⁤‌\nDepartment:\nJust yesterday, air⁣ simulation fans proudly tossed their tickets to paradise, eager to board Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 . ‍Unfortunately, the turbulence was almost immediate! Since its launch, some players have had a huge⁤ problem and they were based ⁢on the story. While Microsoft and Asobo are looking for a solution to this problem, players are attacking the title on Steam.\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator fails ‍to spread its wings In ‍August 2020, the license Flight simulator fly to⁢ other skies. After fourteen years of waiting, the franchise spread its wings again, carried by the masterpiece of the French​ studio Asobo.⁢ Crowned with an excellent critical reception from the press – the ⁢players, on the other hand, were‌ a little less enthusiastic – this famous return made Microsoft’s thoughts inevitable. ‌ Not surprisingly\nFor aerobatics and air travel enthusiasts, the appointment is made: they will be ready for take-off ⁣on ⁣November ‍19. However, the turbulence in⁣ the middle‍ of the crossing was only temporary Microsoft flight simulator 2024 to me they ‍stem .‍ On paper, all the conditions are met‌ for a ​smooth ride worthy of⁣ a business class service, but ​the title – available on Xbox Series X/S​ and PC, but also via Game⁤ Pass Ultimate‍ and PC ⁣Game Pass – has had major difficulties -. On the players’ side, the passengers, impatient to fly⁢ to seventh heaven, were quick to express their displeasure.\nLaunch that turns into an accident on the Steam platform Like in real life, this is the nightmare that ‌happened to many gamers / ⁣travelers. For some, the flight on board Microsoft flight simulator 2024 postponed due to a technical incident, and not the least. Loading times were what forced some players to stay on the tarmac. ​ unusually long ⁤», to repeat the message displayed on many screens . As a result, the ⁤title was simply unplayable, which failed to quell the frustration of players, stuck in⁢ front of a progress bar that stagnated at 97%. Quickly, the players spread the‌ word and ‍took their ⁤pens to express their difficulties on Steam.\nWe are aware of user reports of long initial ⁣load times in ⁢Microsoft⁢ Flight Simulator 2024.\nWith so many users starting the SIM at the same time, we have⁤ a large number of server requests. We are working to help resolve the issues as soon ‍as possible.\nFor ⁢users⁢ who have…\n— MSFS Support (@MSFS_Support) November 19, 2024\nOn⁤ the Valve platform, there are currently more than 2,600 evaluations, 2,662 to be⁤ exact, in which players express their anger . A⁤ direct consequence, the new iteration ⁣of it Flight simulator ⁣It is⁤ decked out a​ suggested percentage‌ of only 16%, corresponding to “extremely negative” evaluations.\nUpdated⁣ by Jinxeb, November 20, 2024 at 11:30:45\nthe wait for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to come out will never end. After a difficult⁤ first day, conditions​ are now good ⁤for the ⁣title. ⁣This morning, the technical incident⁣ that⁤ caused heavy criticism of the game seems to have disappeared. Go to the skies!\nHow can developers effectively regain player trust after a disappointing ⁤game launch? Interview: The Flight Simulator Fumble – An In-Depth Look with Dr. Emily Cartwright, Gaming Technical Analyst\nEditor⁣ (Time.news): Welcome, Dr. Cartwright! Thank you for ​joining us today. As‌ you know, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has faced a‌ rocky start with numerous‌ complaints from eager⁢ players. What’s your take on the situation?\nDr. Emily Cartwright: Thanks for having ⁤me! It’s disappointing to see a highly anticipated title like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 run into such issues ⁢right at‍ launch. Players ⁢were‍ looking forward to an immersive experience, especially given the success of the previous iteration released in 2020. However, facing ⁢technical⁤ incidents that prevent players from ⁢even taking off is a serious​ problem.\nEditor: Indeed, loading times and performance problems seem to be ‍the main culprits. Can you explain why such‌ issues might be particularly prevalent in a flight simulation game compared‌ to other genres?\nDr. ⁤Cartwright: Flight simulators are incredibly complex ‍because they balance a vast array of variables—from realistic⁣ physics and weather‍ to multi-layered graphical ​data. The ⁢newer hardware can handle way more than ever, but⁢ if the software isn’t perfectly optimized, players experience lag, crashes, or excessively long load times. It can be like trying to run‌ a luxury jet on a‌ small plane’s engine!\nEditor: That’s ⁢a vivid analogy! Given the‍ franchise’s rich history and ‍the ⁤hype surrounding this ​release, how‍ do you think Microsoft and Asobo⁢ can⁤ recover ⁣from this setback to⁢ regain player trust?\nDr.‍ Cartwright: Transparency⁤ is ⁢key. They need ⁢to‍ acknowledge⁤ the issues⁤ publicly and provide regular updates on their progress toward a solution. This⁤ involves listening to player⁢ feedback actively. Launching patches​ and ‌updates promptly will also⁢ help to demonstrate their commitment ‍to improving the player experience. ‍It seems players are particularly ⁢vocal on platforms like Steam, which could be both a challenge and an opportunity for the ⁣developers.\nEditor: Given the mixed ⁣reception from players, do you‌ think this will impact the sales and future‍ developments of the franchise?\nDr. Cartwright: ⁢Absolutely. Negative reviews can greatly influence‍ potential buyers, especially when they’re vocalized on major​ platforms. If the issues are not resolved promptly, ⁢it can lead to a lasting stigma ⁢around the franchise, making ‍it hard ‍to attract new players for future expansions or sequels. Fans of⁤ the genre may turn to ‍alternate simulations that offer a smoother​ experience.\nEditor: The gaming community is known for being passionate and vocal. What advice would you give to players ⁤currently feeling frustrated with the‍ game?\nDr. Cartwright: My advice‍ would be to remain⁣ patient and stay informed. Issues like these are often addressed⁤ through community engagement. Besides,⁣ providing feedback ‌in a constructive manner‌ can help developers understand the specific pain points. Players should also explore forums or communities where they ⁣can share their experiences; often, discussing‌ issues can⁢ make ⁤it⁢ feel less isolating.\nEditor: Great perspective,⁢ Dr. Cartwright. As a final‍ thought, could you ‍predict where this rollercoaster of ‍a​ launch ​might lead⁤ us in the future of gaming simulation?\nDr. Cartwright: If ⁣handled correctly, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 ‌could emerge stronger than ​ever, ⁤becoming a case study in crisis management within the gaming industry. Developers‌ need to lean into technology—think AI and cloud computing—to enhance realism while managing performance. This situation⁣ could ultimately lead to better practices across the industry, ‌where titles⁣ are better ⁣tested beforehand, resulting in smoother launches in the future.\nEditor: Thank you for your insights, Dr. Cartwright! It seems ​that ‌while⁣ the flight ‍has encountered ‍some turbulence, there may yet ⁤be a chance for it to soar. We ‌appreciate your time today.\nDr. Cartwright: Thank you! I hope for a‌ smooth takeoff ​soon.",

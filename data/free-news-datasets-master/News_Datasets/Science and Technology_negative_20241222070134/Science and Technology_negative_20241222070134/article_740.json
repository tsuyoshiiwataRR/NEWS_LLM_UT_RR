    "text": "With over 20 million users, Bluesky, a rival to Elon Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter), has experienced rapid growth in recent times. Scammers, however, have also started taking advantage of this quick surge. As more users are switching to Bluesky, cryptocurrency scammers have begun to target unsuspecting individuals. Crypto frauds have already surfaced on Bluesky, including fake websites and giveaways. As the platform encounters increasing difficulties in moderating its content, the problem is getting worse, with Bluesky's safety team receiving record amounts of scam-related reports. Rising Crypto Scams on Bluesky With Bluesky reaching close to 21 million users, crypto scammers have started exploiting the platform to target its growing user base. BleepingComputer reports a string of suspicious posts about fake cryptocurrency assets like \\\"MetaChain\\\" and \\\"MetaCoin,\\\" which deceive users by linking these products to the tech giant Meta and its \\\"Metaverse\\\" concept. To convince users that the cryptocurrency assets are authentic Meta products, one post even included an AI-generated picture of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Another scam promoted a fake Bitcoin giveaway, promising users a reward of $900,000 (~Rs 7.6 crore). Clicking the link led to a website, which has since been taken down. There are also posts linking to fraudulent websites that falsely claim to offer huge amounts of free cryptocurrency, with no trading risks involved. The Platform Struggles with Moderation Bluesky’s safety team revealed that the platform had received an all-time high of over 42,000 reports in just 24 hours, with about 3,000 reports coming in every hour. The platform’s moderators are working overtime to handle the influx of user complaints. However, with millions of new users joining every week, Bluesky is facing an overwhelming challenge in keeping spam, scams, and trolling under control. Bluesky has made it clear that they are prioritising removing harmful content, such as child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and are encouraging users to report suspicious accounts and posts. In order to handle the growing volume of user reports, the platform also announced that they are stepping up their moderating efforts. Challenges of Decentralisation Bluesky has a decentralised model, which means that no single organisation manages the entire system, in contrast to centralised social media sites like X or Instagram. While this increases user autonomy, it also presents difficulties for content moderation. Scammers might create their own instances to spread fraudulent schemes since Bluesky permits third-party operators to host their own instances. Scams can propagate and acquire traction more easily since these instances can still communicate with users on the main Bluesky server. While the decentralised nature of Bluesky offers benefits like greater user control and freedom, it also complicates the moderation process, especially as the platform’s user base grows. Bluesky will need to find new ways to tackle these scams without compromising its core principles of decentralisation.

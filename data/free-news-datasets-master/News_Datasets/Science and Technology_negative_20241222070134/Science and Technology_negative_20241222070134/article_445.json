    "text": "If some think that Greece is in the 21 THE century and in digital technology should probably revisit these views. Since the launch of the much-hyped platform that aims to “fight” tax evaders , Documento has received many calls about malfunctions and the platform not allowing you to log in or save.\nRead also: Pothen Esches: Declaration platform 2024 opened – The 8 stages of the process\nIn the Greece of 2024, even the much-hyped platforms that are supposed to integrate us into the civilized world do not function properly or simply function with enormous problems that nullify the very usefulness of digital technology.\nOne such government failure is the much publicized “Nowhere” platform which they are now thinking of fixing!\nThe most important but essential problems: It is not possible to make a temporary save if all elements are not filled. That’s how you lose them and have to start over. “Finalizing” also has a problem with the message the user receives that a “glitch” has occurred. And these are only part of the errors presented by the platform since the entire filling is a slalom of luck to end up sending it.\nOfficially the problems will be resolved soon with the update (fix) of the errors but one wonders how it is possible that it has been released for use before the necessary tests and corrections have been carried out by the experts.\nAccording to the announcement from the Ministry of Digital Governance: Start of submission of declarations for the year 2024 on the new POTHEN platform\nAvailable, through the new POTHEN platform, www.pothen.gr the possibility of submitting annual declarations for the year 2024 (use 2023) by debtors.\nThe submission of initial declarations for the years 2023 and 2024 will be available in the next few days pending the submission of data by financial institutions to the General Secretariat of Information Systems and Digital Government of the Ministry of Digital Government.\nPlease note that the submission of annual returns for the year 2023 (use 2022) is already available through the new POTHEN platform. The deadline for submitting the Asset Declaration is 31.12.2024.\nRead also:\nUSA: A banana attached to the wall sold for 6.2 million – Who is the buyer (Photo)\nWeather: At the gates of the “P” type atmospheric disturbance – Rain, cold and snow are on the way\nA gift to doctors with pandemic prescriptions – Afternoon interventions with Recovery Fund funds and more than double charges\nDebate on SYRIZA: All “4” with… savoir vibrate for the new SYRIZA SLAPP via AADE: New fine of 161,000 euros to Documento in retaliation for our revelations",

    "text": "\\nBroadband connections in India have dropped by 0.51% to 944.4 million in September 2024, from 949.21 million in August . This is the first time in 2024 that India has seen a decline in broadband connections this year. This loss of connections is coming from a decline in India\\u2019s wireless connection base which went from 906.37 million to 900.77 million. Further, within the wireless connections, mobile connections (phones and dongles) declined by 0.63% going from 905.46 million to 899.79 million in September.\\xa0\n\\nThis decline in subscribers comes after the three major private telcos\\u2014 Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea (Vi)\\u2014 increased the prices of their internet plans in July this year. Given that the tariff hike was directed towards mobile connections , this decline in subscribers could be motivated by the higher prices.\\xa0\n\\n \\nOn the other hand, in the fixed wireless segment (like Wi-Fi), connections have increased by 9.01% going from 0.91 million in August to 0.99 million in September. Similarly, wired connections in India also increased by 1.83% going from 42.84 million in August to 43.63 million in September.\\xa0\n\\n Other observations from the data: \\n Jio sees further decline in subscriber base: \\nJio\\u2019s broadband connections have been falling since July. In June, the company had 488.94 million connections, which have since fallen to 477.94 million as of September. Specifically between August and September, the company lost 7.35 million connections. The decline in connections across the past few months is coming from the wireless segment, which, between August and September, fell from 471.75 million to 463.78 million.\\xa0\n\\nIn its most recent earnings call , Jio acknowledged that on a quarterly basis, it has lost about 11 million subscribers as of September 30. The company said that this subscriber decline was nothing unusual with its CFO V Srikanth adding that this was lower than the subscriber decline the company saw in its past tariff hike.\n\\n Airtel and Vi see subscriber increases: \\nWhile all three companies increased prices, Airtel and Vi did not lose broadband connections in September. On the contrary, Airtel\\u2019s connections went from 284.04 million in August to 284.55 million in September, and Vi\\u2019s connection base grew from 125.92 million to 126.36 million.\\xa0\n\\nBetween the two companies, Vi was the only one who experienced a hit because of the tariff hike in the past couple of months. In June, the company used to have 127.82 million connections, however, its connection base dropped to 125.92 by August, only to recover by 0.44 million in September. Just like Jio, Vi has also previously addressed the impact of tariff hikes, stating that its customers have temporarily shifted to BSNL and will return back. \\u201cCustomers who are used to a good coverage, and experience of 4G, probably the current offering of BSNL may not be to that extent,\\u201d Vi\\xa0 CEO Akshay Moondra said in August .\n\\n BSNL benefits from private telcos\\u2019 tariff hike: \\nAs Jio loses its subscriber base, BSNL has been steadily seeing an improvement in wireless connections. Between August and September, BSNL\\u2019s total broadband connection base grew by 1.53 million. The growth in connections is coming from the wireless segment which increased from 32 million to 33.5 million in September.\\xa0\n\\n Airtel maintains a prominent position in the M2M market: \\nAirtel\\u2019s machine-to-machine (M2M) connections stood at 28.44 million in September which is a slight increase of 0.3 million from August. The company maintains a market share of 52.06% followed by Vi, Reliance Jio Infocom Limited and BSNL with a market share of 27.12%, 15.29%, and 5.54% respectively. Total M2M connections in India stood at 54.64 million in September 2024.\\xa0\n\\n \\n Source: TRAI Data\n\\n Also read:\n\\n\\n",

    "text": "Disclaimer - I have simracing experience in almost every racing game under the sun - iRacing, Asseto, rFactor, RaceRoom etc. I have all of these installed right now on my PC and on ALL of them, my G29 wheel works correctly with respect to force feedback.\nF1 24 is the first game I am trialing from the F1 Codemasters series. And the force feedback simply stops working mid corner on some corner of some tracks.\nFor example, Zandvoort. Force feedback works OK (although the quality of FF compared to other games seems quite low, but I digress) in all of the corners EXCEPT the last chicane, where it simply vanishes.\nAustin - On Turn 1, top of the hill, it also vanishes but as soon as you start going downhill it comes back abruptly. And sometimes as it goes back it locks my steering wheel fully towards one direction. Same happens on turn 11.\nIf I disable FF and use the self-centering spring on Logitech Software, then these flaws disappear, but so does any feedback from the car (which, although minimal, it exists).\nWhat the hell is happening? Is EA able to retain a new customer like me or am I going to uninstall it and never touch any Codemasters F1 game ever again?",

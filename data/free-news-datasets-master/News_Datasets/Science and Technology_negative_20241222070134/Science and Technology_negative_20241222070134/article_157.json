    "text": "Epic Games has announced through their website that there will be some major changes coming to Fortnite in December.\nThe most significant change is that Fortnite Crew subscriptions are now being upgraded to include the LEGO Pass and Music Pass.\n“Starting December 1, Fortnite Crew will also include the Music Pass and LEGO® Pass at no additional cost! As an active Fortnite Crew subscriber you’ll be able to claim premium rewards from all passes in Fortnite starting December 1, and playing any experience will progress all of them simultaneously, yielding a ton of rewards as you gain XP.”\nAnd, for the first time since the game’s launch, the Battle Pass will be seeing a price hike, as it goes up from 950 V-Bucls to 1,000. The price for V-Bucks remain the same however, and, like always, they can be purchased through the Nintendo Switch eShop .\n“Also changing on December 1 is the price of the Battle Royale Battle Pass, which is going up 50 V-Bucks from 950 to 1,000. The real money price of V-Bucks will remain the same, and you’ll still be able to earn V-Bucks through leveling the Battle Pass. The 25 Battle Pass Reward Bundle will now be available for 1,800 V-Bucks (down from 1,850), and the Battle Bundle of both the Battle Pass and 25 Battle Pass rewards will be available for 2,800 V-Bucks.”\nThis all comes ahead of the permanent return of the Fortnite OG mode on December 6, which continues to be highly anticipated and a source of much hype.\nReaders can check out Epic’s full announcement here .\nVia",

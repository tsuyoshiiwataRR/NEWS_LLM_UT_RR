    "text": "MicroStrategy Stock Falls Despite Bitcoin Reaching $100K\nNovember 22, 2024\n[ BACK TO NEWS](/en/news)\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) drops 16% as Bitcoin hits a new record, drawing attention from analysts and investors - IcoHolder.\nMicroStrategy (MSTR), the Bitcoin-focused business intelligence company, saw its stock take a significant dip on Thursday, despite Bitcoin (BTC) surging to new heights, approaching the $100,000 mark. At one point, MSTR shares plummeted by more than 20%, before closing the session down 16.2%. While this drop is notable, it doesn't overshadow the company's remarkable performance in 2024. MSTR's stock is still up more than five-fold for the year and nearly eight times its value from the same period last year.\nThe dip in MicroStrategy's stock price has raised questions among analysts and investors, especially considering the backdrop of Bitcoin's record-breaking price. As Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, many wondered why MicroStrategy, which holds over 330,000 Bitcoin on its balance sheet, failed to fully capitalize on the bullish sentiment. Andrew Left of Citron Research, who once championed MSTR as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure, commented that the company's valuation has become increasingly disconnected from Bitcoin's fundamentals. Left, who remains bullish on Bitcoin, has hedged his position by shorting MicroStrategy's stock.\nAt one point on Thursday, MicroStrategy’s market cap exceeded $100 billion, more than three times the value of its Bitcoin holdings, which were worth approximately $32.5 billion at the time. The company's valuation is now roughly $80 billion, following the recent decline in its stock price. This massive discrepancy between the value of its Bitcoin holdings and its market cap has prompted some to question whether MicroStrategy's stock is overinflated, with the company's performance seen as a reflection of speculative market trends rather than fundamental growth.\nTechnician Bracco, who is well-known for following stock trends, also raised alarms about MicroStrategy’s recent performance, noting that the stock had seen consecutive double-digit gains, often accompanied by large overnight price jumps. Bracco described this as a \"textbook parabolic short,\" implying that the stock was vulnerable to a significant pullback after its recent rise.\nDespite the volatility, the company's high valuation has provided it with a unique advantage, allowing it to raise capital at favorable terms and continue accumulating more Bitcoin. This creates a positive feedback loop: as Bitcoin's price rises, MicroStrategy’s stock price climbs, giving the company more funds to buy Bitcoin, which in turn boosts the stock further. This cycle has been instrumental in driving MSTR's stock price to where it is today.\nWhile this strategy has worked in the short term, some analysts caution that investors betting on MicroStrategy's stock are essentially wagering on the inefficiencies of the market. Jonathan Weil, writing in the Wall Street Journal’s \"Heard on the Street\" column, summed up the situation: \"To speculate on Bitcoin’s future growth is one thing, but to bet on [MicroStrategy’s ](https://icoholder.com/en/microstrategy-1011646)stock is to gamble on the inefficiencies of the market becoming even more pronounced.\"\nAs Bitcoin continues to rise, MicroStrategy's role as a proxy for Bitcoin investment will remain a key topic of discussion. The company’s stock price may continue to see wild swings as Bitcoin’s value fluctuates, but one thing is certain: MicroStrategy’s unique approach to leveraging its Bitcoin holdings has sparked both interest and skepticism among investors.",

    "text": "Justin Sullivan/Getty Images One day in the near future, Elon Musk ‘s artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Grok will take the place of your doctor’s office visit. Grok has already identified breast cancer in some X users.\nMusk has asked X users to upload their medical data, including x-rays and blood test results, to Grok for analysis.\n“Try submitting x-ray, PET, MRI or other medical images to Grok for analysis,” Musk wrote on X last month. “This is still early stage, but it is already quite accurate and will become extremely good. Let us know where Grok gets it right or needs work.”\nBut Grok needs a little more work, some doctors say. The AI successfully analyzed blood test results and identified breast cancer, according to some users. But it also grossly misinterpreted other health problems, according to doctors who responded to Musk’s X post.\nIn one example, Grok mistook a “textbook case” of spinal tuberculosis for a herniated disk or spinal stenosis.\nOne doctor shared a scan of a patient’s spine that shows “paradiscal” TB infections on the spine.\nThe doctor tweeted: “Needs to improve a lot @elonmusk, maybe it needs to know the location of the user uploading the image as well, because prevalence of TB is more in India than the US.”\nIn another case, the AI chatbot mistook a mammogram of a benign breast cyst for an image of testicles.",

    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nAn international team of scientists has identified a previously unknown compound in the drinking water of approximately one-third of Americans. The compound, named chloronitramide anion, is a byproduct of chloramine, a chemical used by many water treatment plants to make water safe to drink. The study, published in the journal Science, has raised concerns about potential health risks associated with the compound.\nThe researchers, led by Julian Fairey of the University of Arkansas, used advanced techniques to isolate and identify the compound. They found that about 113 million people are exposed to chloronitramide anion through their tap water. However, the toxicity of the compound is currently unknown. The study authors noted that the properties of chloronitramide anion are similar to those of other molecules that are toxic enough for the government to regulate them. According to CNN , the researchers are calling for further research to understand the potential implications of chloronitramide anion in drinking water.\nChloramines have been widely used as an alternative to chlorine for disinfecting drinking water since the 1970s. While they don't seem to have the same potentially dangerous byproducts as chlorine, scientists have noticed that chloramines also create byproducts, one of which remained a mystery until now. Newsweek reports that the discovery of chloronitramide anion could reignite debate over the widespread use of chloramines in water treatment.",

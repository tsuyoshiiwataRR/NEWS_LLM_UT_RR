    "text": "How to uninstall the MYWeb Watch browser-hijacking application\n Written by Tomas Meskauskas on\nWhat kind of application is MYWeb Watch?\nMYWeb Watch is a [browser-hijacking application](/common-types-of-computer-infections#browser-hijacker) discovered by our researchers during a routine investigation of dubious websites. Unlike most browser hijackers, which are extensions, MYWeb Watch does not modify browser settings in order to generate redirects to promoted webpages. Instead, this app detects when a Web search is made and produces a redirect in response.\nIt is noteworthy that browser-hijacking software commonly has data-tracking functionalities, and this might apply to MYWeb Watch.\nMYWeb Watch browser hijacker overview\nTypically, browser hijackers make changes to browser settings (e.g., homepages, default search engines, new tab/window URLs, etc.) to promote websites. However, the MYWeb Watch application (installation location – C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Microsoft\\WebWatch) does not modify browsers. Instead, it detects when the Web is searched and generates a redirect to the endorsed site.\nAt the time of research, this app produced redirects leading through the [guardflares.com](/removal-guides/31477-guardflares-com-redirect) fake search engine before landing on another – [potterfun.com](/removal-guides/31253-potterfun-com-redirect).\nMost fraudulent search engines cannot provide search results, so they redirect to legitimate Internet search sites. Potterfun.com is an exception, but the search results generated by this webpage are irrelevant and may include sponsored, untrustworthy, deceptive, and possibly malicious content. It must be mentioned that MYWeb Watch could produce different redirection chains.\nFurthermore, browser hijackers often spy on users' browsing activity, and this might be true of MYWeb Watch. Targeted information may include: visited URLs, viewed pages, searched queries, Internet cookies, usernames/passwords, personally identifiable details, finance-related data, and so on. The collected information can be shared with or sold to third-parties.\nIn summary, the presence of software like MYWeb Watch on devices may result in system infections, severe privacy issues, financial losses, and even identity theft.\nNote that before commencing with MYWeb Watch's removal, as instructed in the guide below, its process must be terminated using Task Manager. It must be emphasized that this browser hijacker has to be eliminated thoroughly, including any files left in its installation folder.\nName | MYWeb Watch redirect |\nThreat Type | Browser Hijacker, Redirect, Search Hijacker, PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program), PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application) |\nDetection Names (installer) | Microsoft (Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.H!ml), Rising (Adware.Agent@XH.99F9 (CERT:9d2dlh/drc), Full List Of Detections (\n|\nVirusTotal)[guardflares.com](/removal-guides/31477-guardflares-com-redirect)https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/bf3084600579541ad13f31bf0987c21f633f8164a312a80a22de0e5d831f3c0a/detection)To eliminate possible malware infections, scan your computer with legitimate antivirus software.

It can also offer a broad range of useful functionalities; however, these features seldom work as advertised, and in most cases – they do not work at all. Remember that operational functions alone do not prove a software's legitimacy or safety.\nHow did MYWeb Watch install on my computer?\nWe have found several scam pages using pirated movie and adult video download-themed lures to promote MYWeb Watch. Other endorsement techniques are possible. In addition to various scam sites, browser hijackers can have \"official\" promotional webpages.\nMost visitors access these pages via redirects caused by websites employing rogue advertising networks, intrusive ads, [spam browser notifications](/common-types-of-computer-infections#notification-spam), mistyped URLs, and installed [adware](/common-types-of-computer-infections#adware).\nBrowser-hijacking software can also be bundled with ordinary programs. The risk of unintentionally permitting bundled content into the system is increased by downloading from dubious channels (e.g., freeware and free file-hosting websites, Peer-to-Peer sharing networks, etc.) and by treating installations with negligence (e.g., ignoring terms, skipping steps, using \"Easy/Express\" settings, etc.).\nIntrusive advertisements proliferate browser hijackers as well. Once clicked on, some of these adverts can execute scripts to perform downloads/installations without user consent.\nHow to avoid installation of browser hijackers?\nWe highly recommend researching software and downloading it only from official/verified sources. Installation processes must be approached with caution, e.g., by reading terms, exploring possible options, using the \"Custom/Advanced\" settings, and opting out of all additional apps, extensions, features, etc.\nAnother recommendation is to be vigilant while browsing since fraudulent and malicious online content usually appears legitimate and harmless. For example, while intrusive adverts may look innocuous – they redirect to questionable and unreliable websites (e.g., scam-promoting, pornography, gambling, adult dating, etc.).\nIn case of continuous encounters with such ads/redirects, inspect the device and immediately remove all suspicious applications and browser extensions/plug-ins. If your computer is already infected with MYWeb Watch, we recommend running a scan with [Combo Cleaner Antivirus for Windows](/download-combo-cleaner-windows) to automatically eliminate this browser hijacker.\nAppearance of [guardflares.com](/removal-guides/31477-guardflares-com-redirect) redirecting to [potterfun.com](/removal-guides/31253-potterfun-com-redirect) (GIF):\nAppearance of MYWeb Watch browser hijacker:\nScreenshot MYWeb Watch browser hijacker's installation setup:\nScreenshot of MYWeb Watch browser hijacker's process on Task Manager (\"MYWebWatch\" – process name):\nScreenshots of deceptive websites promoting MYWeb Watch browser hijacker:\nInstant automatic malware removal:\nManual threat removal might be a lengthy and complicated process that requires advanced IT skills.

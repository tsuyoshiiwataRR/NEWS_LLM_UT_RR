    "text": "Though Black Ops 6 has been a hit for many gamers so far, it appears that Treyarch's choices regarding playlists is negatively impacting some fans' enjoyment of the title. Though some may value map variety when it comes to multiplayer matches, others want to get as much out of maps like Stakeout and Nuketown and specific playlists as they possibly can, with the latter crowd being the one that is frustrated with recen playlist adjustments.\nReddit users Wraithhh and Jdammworldwide are among this group of Black Ops 6 players who want Stakeout 24/7 and 10v10 back, and they're trying to make sure that Treyarch hears their demands. These Black Ops 6 players seem to be in agreement that many of the maps just don't have a proper flow during regular multiplayer gameplay, and have expressed a strong preference for Stakeout since its hectic nature makes the lack of flow less apparent.\n[Bring Back Stakeout 24/7!!]\nby[u/Wraithhh]in[blackops6]\n[Bring back 10v10]\nby[u/Jdammworldwide]in[blackops6]\nSince Treyarch seems especially attentive to player requests for this title, as it has already made major changes across the board based on fan feedback, gamers are also expressing their wishes for 10v10 Moshpit, which many think just adds to the overall experience. Knowing that it's possible, but not having the option to play 10v10 in Black Ops 6 seems pointless to some fans.\nPosted:\nRelated Forum:\n[Call of Duty Forum](/Forums/f=268/call-of-duty-forum.html)\nSource: https://gamerant.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-stakeout-10v10-playlist-removal-complaint/",

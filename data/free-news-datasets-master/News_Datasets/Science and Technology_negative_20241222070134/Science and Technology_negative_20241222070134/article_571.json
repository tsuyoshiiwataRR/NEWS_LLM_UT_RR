    "text": "Key Takeaways\n- Black Ops 6 update caused errors in player classes and Zombies data.\n- Players lost their loadouts post-update, affecting customization.\n- Despite ongoing frustrations, Zombies medals and Multiplayer progress will be restored.\nSince its inception, the [Call of Duty](https://www.thegamer.com/tag/call-of-duty/) franchise has been known for pushing out almost daily updates to the game, and [Black Ops 6](https://www.thegamer.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/) is no different. Following [Season 1's](https://www.thegamer.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-has-surprise-dropped-early/) launch last week, new playlists, [events](https://www.thegamer.com/cod-bo6-hit-list-event-guide-rewards/), changes and small fixes have hit the game regularly.\n[Related ](/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-blops6-zombies-wonder-weapon-leak-sword-four-variations/)\n[ Black Ops 6 Zombies' New Wonder Weapon Is A Sword, Leakers Claim ](/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-blops6-zombies-wonder-weapon-leak-sword-four-variations/)\nA castle with a wonder weapon that has four variations... Close enough. Welcome back, Der Eisendrache.\nUnfortunately for players, the update, which dropped on Thursday, November 21, broke certain elements of the online title, some of which can't be recovered.\nCall Of Duty: Black Ops 6 Update Breaks Zombies Data And Resets Player Classes\nFollowing the update, reports quickly flooded in from players who had lost their [Zombies](https://www.thegamer.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-all-zombie-types-tips/) data and had their online multiplayer loadouts completely reset. It's a frustrating issue for many, with players often spending time meticulously creating loadouts to fit certain maps and the game's different multiplayer modes, especially with its many customization and camo options.\nActivision was quick to acknowledge the issue, making two posts on its Trello boards, one for the [Zombies issue](https://trello.com/c/sphBXRSb) and one for the [Multiplayer profile data issue](https://trello.com/c/zJSfmbEO). The company confirmed that it was working on a fix that started rolling out a few hours later, but unfortunately, it wasn't able to fix everything.\nIt said, of both the game's Zombies and Multiplayer modes, that any player who logged in after the game's first loadout-breaking update but before the second update would not have their customizations restored, and instead, it encourages players to \"recreate and reselect their previous loadouts and settings.\"\nWe encourage players to recreate and reselect their their previous loadouts and settings.\nThankfully, it looks like only customization will be affected in the long run. Activision confirmed that Zombies medals, intel, and save file data will be restored, and Multiplayer progression, challenge progress, and medals will all be fine. It later said that it is \"planning a future restoration pass for users who fall under specific criteria.\"\nWhile things started well for Activision with this year's Call of Duty title, frustrations have slowly begun to creep in for players. Alongside this data reset, players are annoyed at the ongoing [Smoke Grenade meta](https://www.thegamer.com/black-ops-6-players-want-smoke-grenade-changes/), the [Double XP Token removal](https://www.thegamer.com/treyarch-explains-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-double-xp-token-removal/), and the lack of [Stakeout 24/7](https://www.thegamer.com/black-ops-6-players-just-want-stakeout-24-7-back/).\nForced to go rogue. Hunted from within. This is Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.\nDeveloped by Treyarch and Raven, Black Ops 6 is a spy action thriller set in the early 90s, a period of transition and upheaval in global politics, characterized by the end of the Cold War and the rise of the United States as a single superpower. With a mind-bending narrative, and unbound by the rules of engagement, this is signature Black Ops.\nThe Black Ops 6 Campaign provides dynamic moment-to-moment gameplay that includes a variety of play spaces with blockbuster set pieces and action-packed moments, high-stakes heists, and cloak-and-dagger spy activity.\nIn a best-in-class Multiplayer experience, players will test their skills across 16 new maps at launch, including 12 core 6v6 maps and 4 Strike maps that can be played 2v2 or 6v6.\nBlack Ops 6 also marks the epic return of Round-Based Zombies, the fan-favorite mode where players will take down hordes of the undead in two brand-new maps at launch. Post-launch, players can look forward to even more exciting maps and groundbreaking experiences dropping into both Multiplayer and Zombies.\n[OpenCritic Reviews](https://opencritic.com/game/17124/call-of-duty-black-ops-6)- Top Critic Rating:83/100 Critics Recommend:93%\n- OpenCritic Rating\n- Strong",

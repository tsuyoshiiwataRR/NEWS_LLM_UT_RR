The glass screen protectors are most popular for curved screens, where UV glue is used for secure adhesion. These protectors provide great edge-to-edge coverage, but improper installation and low-quality materials can damage your phone's performance and durability.\nThreats of Using UV-Cured Screen Protectors\nVivo highlighted a few problems that could occur in the application of UV glue incorrectly:\nAesthetic and Material Damage: UV glue can harm materials like leather battery covers, causing bulges or peeling, and may lead to paint chipping on the camera frame.\nAir Bubble Issues: During application, air bubbles can force glue into sensitive areas such as receivers or side buttons, which can create noise or serve as an operational issue.\nAudio Interference: The sound output will become distorted or muffled if it covers the speaker hole.\nButton Malfunctions: Adhesive may seep through side buttons and make them sticky, unusable, or sticking and malfunctioning.\nSIM Tray and Water Resistance Issues: If glue enters the SIM tray, it can complicate insertion and removal while compromising the phone's water-resistant seals.\nVivo emphasized that damages caused by improper installation, especially by unauthorized technicians, are not covered under the warranty.\nVivo's Recommendations for Protection\nVivo recommends applying authentic screen protectors obtained at its authorized service centres to protect your smartphone. The protectors are custom-designed for each Vivo model, ensuring perfect fitting and maximum protection.\nFor users choosing UV-cured tempered glass, Vivo advises extra precautions during installation:\nCover sensitive areas like the receiver, side buttons, and SIM tray with the sealing film provided in the packaging.\nAvoid applying excessive glue and ensure even spreading to prevent seepage.\nSeek professional assistance from authorized service centres to minimize risks.\nWhy You Should Act Now\nAlthough UV-cured screen protectors add extra shine and feel to the phone, the risks of improper installation outweigh the benefits. Original accessories and adherence to Vivo guidelines ensure protection against long-term damage while maintaining performance and looks. Stay alert and instead opt for safety over shortcuts that will keep your Vivo smartphone in perfect condition.\n© 2024 Hyderabad Media House Limited/The Hans India. All rights reserved.

    "text": "Transport Department alerts public to fraudulent websites purported to be from HKeToll\n**************************************************************************************\nThe TD clarifies that the fraudulent websites have no connection with the HKeToll and has referred the case to the Police for follow-up. The TD reiterates that the HKeToll only uses \"#HKeToll\" as the sender ID for issuing SMS messages to users or vehicle owners. Users or vehicle owners must log in to the HKeToll website (\nhketoll.gov.hk) or mobile app to pay outstanding tolls online.\nMembers of the public should stay alert when receiving messages without the prefix \"#\" but purportedly issued by the HKeToll or any unidentified messages, and should not visit suspicious websites or disclose any personal information. Anyone who has provided his or her personal information to the websites concerned should contact the Police. For enquiries about the HKeToll, please call 3853 7333.\nEnds/Friday, November 22, 2024\nIssued at HKT 12:01\nIssued at HKT 12:01\nNNNN",

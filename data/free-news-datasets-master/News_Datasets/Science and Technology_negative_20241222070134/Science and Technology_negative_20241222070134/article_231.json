Only option was to \"try a different phone that isn't up to date?\"\nI have all Google products, Google phones and home devices, this is a disappointment\n10-05-2024 01:15 PM\nHi Kesepton,\nThanks for posting in the community! I understand how frustrating it is when you’re not able to add the Nest Mini to the Google Home app and the Device Utility app isn’t supported on your mobile device. Help’s here!\nTo better investigate the inconvenience, I’d like to gather and confirm the following:\nIn the meantime, I’d suggest the following:\nPlease keep me updated.\nBest regards,\nJenniffer\n3 weeks ago\nHis issue is that his phone is up to date. I am having the same issue. It says it cannot download the device utility app as it's for an older version of Android. How am I suppose to set the Google home hub??? Google Pixel 8 pro andriod v14\n3 weeks ago\nYep, same problem here with a Pixel 7 (and an older Pixel 3a). Apparently you can't set up a new Nest device with a Pixel? Thanks for being a loyal Google device customer, I guess.\nFriday\nJennifer are you all working on a solution for this?\nI am also having the same issue. Just purchased a new Nest mini for the second floor in my townhouse. I am getting the same message that I need the utility app but that the app is made for an older version android phone.\nI also purchased Nest doorbell and Nest camera and I was able to add these items just fine. It is insane that this is happening for the most simple smart speaker. Google can you please help us out with a solution?? We are a Google/Pixel household I have no other way to add my Nest mini.\nTuesday\nI just got a new nest mini, my 4th one and I am not able to set it up due to my Pixel 7 being newer than the app. I've no issue setting up any device until today. I have 3 other nest minis, cameras and a doorbell.\n2 weeks ago\nI have a Pixel 7 and I am having the same problem, can't download the device utility app as it says it's made for older phone models? How do I set up/activate my google nest mini then when the Google Home app tells me to use the device utility app first?\na week ago\nSame problem here. Pixel 7a and new nest mini. Can't setup because my phone is too \"new\". How crazy is this?\nHorrible user experience by Google.\nA solution should be given promptly.\na week ago\nOh man, I'm having the same issue on my Pixel 4a, but I'm not thrilled to see that it's this common. I have a bunch of nest minis that I've never had this issue with, but I got one as a birthday present, and can't connect without the Device Utility app. Anyone found a way to connect these, or should I just return it? That's disappointing.\nFriday\nI am also having the same issue. Just purchased a new Nest mini for the second floor in my townhouse.

So I guess we stick with Alexa because it works.\nTuesday\nSame issue with Pixel 6 and Pixel 8 pro. Guess I'll get help from a coworker with a non-pixel and give them a cautionary tale about the Google device ecosystem.\nyesterday\nHi all,\nTo confirm, Google is actively investigating this issue.

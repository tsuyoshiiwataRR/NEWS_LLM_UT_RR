    "text": "As you probably already know, Windows 10 will reach the end of support deadline in October 2025 and Microsoft is trying its hardest to bring those users to Windows 11. This summer cooled down the add campaigns on Windows 10, but lately, the efforts intensified once again.\nNow, we all know that an unsupported OS can become vulnerable to threats and Microsoft wants to grow the Windows 11 fan base, but as one user reports on X , the pop-up ads can be very invasive, to say the least.\nIn the middle of editing, Microsoft bursts in and threatens me pic.twitter.com/mRfOrMvFS5\n‚Äî Justin Whang üêô (@JustinWhang) November 20, 2024 Windows 10 22H2 users get various full screen incentives to upgrade to Windows 11 ranging from security jump scare warnings to the wonderful joys of gaming that the new OS is bringing.\nAnother disgruntled user post on X points out to the fact that all this campaign messages occur while their Windows 10 OS constantly fails to update. We recently reported about KB5048239 for Windows 10 failing to update with the 0x80070643 error and that‚Äôs hardly the only such event.\nWhile the demise of Windows 10 is imminent, if you‚Äôre still using the OS, you can still buy an Extended Security Updates plan and you can even prolong the updates up to 3 years more .\nGamers seem to have embraced the new OS , but the latest issues with the Windows 11 24H2 are not encouraging at all. According to the latest reports from October, the Windows 11 adoption is still going very slow .\nCertainly, the new pop-up ads on Windows 10 may be working but so far, they seem to have the opposite result.\nWhat do you think about the latest Windows 11 ads on Windows 10?

    "text": "A number of subscribers to Yes 5G have reported on social media that they are not getting a connection to the mobile network. This appears to be affecting users from all across Peninsular Malaysia, with complaints coming from Johor all the way to Kedah.\nThe disruption looks to have started about an hour ago at the time of writing, at least based on the earliest reports weâ€™ve seen. At the time of writing, itâ€™s unclear what is causing the network disruption, as yes 5G has yet to issue an official statement.\nDah ada balik line Yes 5G ðŸ¥³ diam-diam je dia pulang pic.twitter.com/MwbvbaVid8\nâ€” Najib/HHH (@najibhhh) November 22, 2024\nThat being the case, among the complaints there are a handful of users who have said that theyâ€™ve been reconnected to the Yes 5G network. But those are, for now, few and far in between.\nFrom the telcoâ€™s website, Yes 5G has a table indicating locations that may be facing network disruption due to the company performing network maintenance. This would affect mobile data as well as voice calls and SMS, and some of these do extend until 6AM of 23 November, but these do not explain network outages in Kedah or Johor.\nWeâ€™ve reached out to Yes 5G, and will update when we hear from the telcoâ€™s reps.",

    "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia has tested a new intermediate range missile in a strike on Ukraine on Thursday.\nAnd he warned that Moscow could use it against countries that have allowed Kyiv to use their missiles to strike Russia.\nMr Putin said in a nationwide TV address that the Russian strike on Ukraine came in response to Ukrainian strikes on the Russian territory with US and British missiles earlier this week.\nHe warned that US air defence systems would not be capable of intercepting Russian missiles.\nMr Putin’s announcement came hours after Ukraine claimed that Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile overnight at the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro.\nBut American officials said an initial US assessment indicated the strike was carried out with an intermediate-range ballistic missile.\nTwo people were wounded in the attack, and an industrial facility and a rehabilitation centre for people with disabilities were damaged, according to local officials.\nThe attack comes in a week when tensions have repeatedly soared, as the US eased restrictions on Ukraine’s use of American-made longer-range missiles inside Russia and Mr Putin lowered the threshold for launching nuclear weapons.\n“Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.\n“And how afraid he is.”\nBallistic missiles can have a range of anywhere from under 300 miles to more than 3,400 miles in the case of intercontinental ones. “Ballistic” refers to the shape of their trajectory.\nThe attack comes during a week of soaring tensions in the war.\nEarlier this week, the Biden administration authorised Ukraine to use US-supplied, longer-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia — a move that drew an angry response from Moscow.\nDays later, Ukraine fired several of the missiles into Russia, according to the Kremlin.\nThe same day, Mr Putin signed a new doctrine that allows for a potential nuclear response even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power.\nThe doctrine is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons. In response, Western countries, including the US, said Russia has used irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behaviour throughout the war to intimidate Ukraine and other nations.\nThey have also expressed dismay at the deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine.\nAlso on Thursday, Russia struck Mr Zelensky’s home city of Kryvyi Rih, wounding 26 people, said the head of regional administration, Serhii Lysak.\nThe missile strike caused damage to an administrative building, at least five multistory residential buildings, and civilian vehicles.\nThe Russian Defence Ministry, meanwhile, said in a statement that its air defence systems shot down two British-made Storm Shadow missiles, six Himars rockets, and 67 drones.\nMore than 1,000 days into war, Russia has the upper hand, with its larger army advancing in Donetsk and Ukrainian civilians suffering from relentless drone and missile strikes.\nAnalysts and observers say that the loosening of restrictions on Ukraine’s use of Western missiles is unlikely to change the the course of the war, but it puts the Russian army in a more vulnerable position and could complicate the logistics that are crucial in warfare.\nMr Putin has also warned the move would mean that Russia and Nato are at war.\n“It is an important move and it pulls against, undermines the narrative that Putin had been trying to establish that it was fine for Russia to rain down Iranian drones and North Korean missiles on Ukraine but a reckless escalation for Ukraine to use Western-supplied weapons at legitimate targets in Russia,” said Peter Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser who now sits in the House of Lords.",

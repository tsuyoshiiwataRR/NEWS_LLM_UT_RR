    "text": "In a dramatic escalation of its ongoing antitrust battle, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), alongside a coalition of states, has officially asked a federal court to compel Google to sell its Chrome browser. This move is part of a broader effort to address the tech giant’s alleged monopolistic practices, particularly in the online search market.\nThe DOJ’s request follows a ruling by Judge Amit Mehta in August, which determined that Google had illegally maintained a monopoly on online search. In response, the DOJ has now doubled down on its antitrust stance, suggesting that forcing the sale of Chrome could be a key remedy. Chrome, which dominates the global browser market with an estimated 67% market share, could potentially fetch up to $20 billion, but its sale would likely cost Google far more in lost revenue than it would gain from a sale, according to Bloomberg.\nAdditionally, the government is pushing for Google to make a tough choice: sell Android, its widely used smartphone operating system, or prohibit the company from making its services mandatory on Android devices. Another key demand involves stopping Google from paying companies like Apple to make its search engine the default on smartphones and web browsers—a practice the DOJ argues gives Google an unfair advantage in maintaining its dominance.\nLegal experts suggest that the focus on Google’s exclusive search agreements, such as those with Apple, may be pivotal. Judge Mehta has previously highlighted the “power of the default” in his rulings, noting that Google’s conduct has created an uneven playing field. The government contends that these exclusive agreements allow Google to unfairly leverage its dominance, which in turn distorts competition and harms consumers.\nGoogle, however, has expressed strong opposition, with President of Global Affairs Ken Walker calling the DOJ’s proposal “extreme.” The company is expected to submit its own proposed solutions by December 20th, with a final ruling from Judge Mehta anticipated by the summer. The outcome of this case could have significant implications not only for Google but for other tech giants, as antitrust scrutiny intensifies across the industry.",

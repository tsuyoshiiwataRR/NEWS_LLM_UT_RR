    "text": "I-League fans face OTP hassle with SSEN website/app\nMany fans complained about issues regarding login in SSEN platform.\nThe new season of the I-League commenced with a thrilling opener between Gokulam Kerala and Sreenidi Deccan, setting the tone for what promises to be an electrifying competition. Sreenidi Deccan, a team that narrowly missed ISL promotion last season by just four points, looked to kick off their campaign with renewed determination.\nThis season, a total of 13 teams from across India, representing the vast diversity of the nation’s footballing talent, are competing for glory in the second tier of Indian football.\nHowever, the excitement on the pitch was initially overshadowed by a storm of controversies off it. The broadcasting rights for the league were a significant point of contention, with clubs voicing their frustration over the lack of clarity.\nIn an unprecedented move, multiple teams came together to hold joint press conferences, urging stakeholders to resolve the issue promptly. Their collective demand reflected the urgency of addressing the concerns of the footballing fraternity and fans alike.\nI-League platform face issues\nAmidst the turmoil, a breakthrough came when Sony Sports Network announced it would broadcast I-League matches from Matchweek 2 onwards, bringing much-needed relief to fans who had been eagerly awaiting updates.\nFurthermore, SSEN secured streaming rights for the league on its OTT platform, ensuring greater accessibility for tech-savvy audiences. This decision was hailed as a positive step towards elevating the visibility of Indian football.\nHowever, the optimism surrounding the broadcast announcement has been marred by technical glitches on the SSEN OTT platform. Many fans have reported issues while attempting to log in, citing repeated “OTP incorrect” notifications that prevent them from accessing live matches. This has led to mounting frustration among Indian football enthusiasts, who had hoped for an uninterrupted viewing experience.\nAdding to this, fans expressed concerns over the timing of the resolution of these broadcasting disputes, which delayed the availability of coverage from the very start of the season.\nWhile Sony’s intervention has brought relief, the absence of broadcasts during the crucial Matchweek 1 fixtures has left a gap in the league’s momentum. Clubs, players, and fans are now hoping that such delays do not recur in the future.\nFor Indian football, the I-League is not just a competition but a critical platform for nurturing local talent and fostering the sport’s growth at the grassroots level.\nThe league has produced several stars who have gone on to represent the nation on bigger stages, and its visibility is key to maintaining this trajectory. Fans are now urging SSEN and the league organizers to address these technical issues swiftly so that the focus can return to the game itself.\nAs the league progresses, the narrative shifts back to the action on the field. Teams are fighting not just for the I-League trophy but also for the chance to gain promotion to the Indian Super League under the new system, adding more stakes to the competition.\nWith the broadcast issues hopefully resolved soon, fans will be eager to witness the journey of their favorite teams as they vie for supremacy in Indian football.\nFor more updates, follow Khel Now on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube; download the Khel Now Android App or IOS App and join our community on Whatsapp & Telegram.\nHellas Verona vs Inter Milan Prediction, lineups, betting tips & oddsI-League 2024-25: All six foreigners of Inter Kashi FCAl Nassr vs Al Qadisiyah: Live streaming, TV channel, kick-off time & where to watch Saudi Pro League 2024-25I-League fans face OTP hassle with SSEN website/appNeymar's 'I wish i were there too' comment on Messi & Suarez hints at possible Inter Miami transfer\nAshutosh Mehta on ISL comeback, national team call-up, relationship with Khalid Jamil & morePetr Kratky highlights this Mumbai City FC player's performance against Kerala BlastersMohun Bagan not be fined by AFC after recognising their case as 'Event of Force Majeure'How much bonus did Vinicius Jr miss out on after losing Ballon d'Or 2024 award?Mats Hummels' girlfriend: Meet Nicola Cavanis, her job, Instagram & more",

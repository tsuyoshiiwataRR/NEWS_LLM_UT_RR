    "text": "Unprecedented Telecom Breach Linked to China Sparks Concerns\nThe U.S. reports a major telecommunications hack linked to China, declaring it the largest in history. Hackers intercepted U.S. law enforcement surveillance data and unofficially accessed political figures' communications. Beijing denies these allegations amidst growing concerns about telecoms' security vulnerabilities.\nThe United States is grappling with an unprecedented breach of telecommunications security, allegedly linked to China, with officials dubbing it the largest telecom hack in national history. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee revealed this information to the Washington Post, highlighting serious security implications.\nAuthorities reported earlier this month that hackers had accessed surveillance data intended for law enforcement. The breach affected multiple telecom networks, allowing unauthorized access to U.S. customer call records and communications from select political figures, as confirmed by a joint FBI and CISA statement.\nDespite China's repeated denials of these accusations, concerns over the vulnerability of U.S. telecom infrastructure are on the rise. This incident, reportedly involving communications of prominent political figures, underscores the ongoing threats posed by cyber-infiltration globally.\nALSO READ\n[ED Raids Amazon and Flipkart Vendors Amidst FDI Rule Breach Allegations](/article/headlines/3148865-ed-raids-amazon-and-flipkart-vendors-amidst-fdi-rule-breach-allegations)[Rising Tensions: Ceasefire Breaches in Eastern Congo](/article/law-order/3150734-rising-tensions-ceasefire-breaches-in-eastern-congo)[Odisha FC Aims to Breach Mohun Baganâ€™s Defensive Wall in Crucial ISL Clash](/article/sports-games/3151902-odisha-fc-aims-to-breach-mohun-bagans-defensive-wall-in-crucial-isl-clash)[Kerala's Left Government Suspends IAS Officers Over Code of Conduct Breaches](/article/law-order/3153559-keralas-left-government-suspends-ias-officers-over-code-of-conduct-breaches)[TMC Files Complaint Against Suvendu Adhikari for MCC Breach](/article/politics/3152680-tmc-files-complaint-against-suvendu-adhikari-for-mcc-breach)",

    "text": "Almost seven out of 10 Hong Kong companies experienced cyberattacks in the past year, the city\\u2019s privacy watchdog has found after a survey revealed that firms\\u2019 cybersecurity readiness still stood at \\u201cbasic\\u201d levels.\nAda Chung (left) and Alex Chan (right) on November 21, 2024.

The index, which evaluates companies\\u2019 policy and risk assessment, technology control, process control, and human awareness building, increased by 5.8 points from last year to 52.8 on a hundred-point scale, placing the city\\u2019s enterprises at the \\u201cbasic\\u201d level.\nCompanies struggled the most in the human awareness category, as a study commissioned by the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) found that just over a third of the 442 companies surveyed had provided cybersecurity awareness training for employees, while just under a quarter had conducted cybersecurity awareness drills.\n\\u201cThe lack of awareness among employees could potentially become one of the biggest vulnerabilities in an enterprise\\u2019s cyber security,\\u201d said Alex Chan, general manager of digital transformation at the Hong Kong Productivity Council, which conducted the survey.\nCompanies needed to conduct regular exercises such as phishing tests and security drills to monitor and address weaknesses, he added.\nCyberattacks, AI tools Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) scored 48.4 points on the index, up 4.8 from last year, while corporates reached an all time high at 73.1 points, up 10.6 from last year, according to the watchdog\\u2019s Thursday statement.\nA laptop.

However, the survey also found that nearly 70 per cent of the surveyed enterprises had experienced at least one type of cyberattack in the past 12 months, a slight decrease of four percentage points from last year. A majority of corporates, at 71 per cent, had experienced cyberattacks.\nThe financial services sector performed the best out of all the six surveyed fields, with a rating of 68.3 on the readiness index.\nThe business sectors covered retail and tourism; manufacturing, trading, and logistics; NGOs, schools, and others; financial services, professional services, and information and communications technology.\nThe privacy commission touted artificial intelligence as a \\u201cdouble-edged sword\\u201d to combat cyberattacks. \\u201cHackers use AI tools\\u2026 how can companies use them to ramp up their cybersecurity regimes?\\u201d Chan said at a press conference on Thursday.\nBanks, for instance, were looking into using an AI tool capable of identifying soundwaves to identify bogus calls, he said.\nThe Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data.

About a fifth of the companies surveyed currently used AI tools in their operations, with a higher adoption rate of 43 per cent among corporations, the survey found.\nOf the companies that had adopted AI, two-thirds had implemented at least one data security measure.\nCompanies and government departments have seen a string of cyberattacks in past months.\nIn May, the Fire Services Department\\xa0 reported a potential data leak , the third similar incident involving a government department\\xa0 in less than a week , following the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and the Companies Registry.\nThe city\\u2019s\\xa0 Consumer Council \\xa0and tech park\\xa0 Cyberport \\xa0also fell victim to hackers last year., while Oxfam saw a potential data breach this July.\nThe government has proposed a cybersecurity law meant to enhance safeguards for critical infrastructure. It is expected to cover cyber systems of sectors including energy, information technology, banking and financial services, land transport, air transport, maritime, communications and broadcasting, and healthcare services.\nUnder the proposed legislation, computer system operators behind critical infrastructure could be fined up to HK$5 million for lapses in cybersecurity.\nHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n HKFP has an\\xa0 impartial stance ,\\xa0 transparent funding , and\\xa0 balanced coverage \\xa0guided by an\\xa0\n\\n \\n \\n \\n Support press freedom & help us surpass 1,000 monthly Patrons : 100% independent, governed by an ethics code & not-for-profit.",

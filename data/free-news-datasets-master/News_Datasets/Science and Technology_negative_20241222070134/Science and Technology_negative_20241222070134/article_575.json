    "text": "Tech giant Meta issued a new statement about deleting more than two million accounts across its family of apps. This includes those found on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook.\nThe tech giant shared how most of those accounts were present in the southern Asian region and had to do with claims about links with forced labor behavior.\nThe top scam operation centers were found in the UAE, Philippines, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos, it explained. More clarification on the matter included details about criminal compounds making people work against their own will. This includes taking part in illegal activities like gambling, investment fraud, crypto scams, and beyond.\nMeta also shared how it was working closely with the law enforcement agencies in these regions to get more details about criminal activities and how they continue to evolve and avoid detection.\nMeta says it’s been very cooperative in regards to investigations, providing officers with all the details they need to hold those involved accountable. This includes sharing necessary data that would help the investigation pick up the pace and punish the offenders.\nThere was also one investigation where Facebook’s parent firm was able to crack down against a newly formed Cambodian group that conducted scams that originated in China after getting back up from AI technology.\nThanks to the long list of evolving techniques, Meta’s investigators really had to put in hard work to identify and highlight the scams on its platforms. A commonly used term here for the behavior at large was pig butchering.\nThis is used to term the act of using certain steps in a specific sequence when scamming victims. It’s quite like using a ‘kill chain’ inside cyberattacks. The entire list of events that occur as outlined by Meta entails steps like spray and pray, manipulate, pitch, bait, and then vanish.\nVictims are lured into believing that the party approaching them is trying to help them and belongs to a very trusted source. This is why the tech giant just launched a list of directives for users to follow to remain guarded against such ordeals. It also rolled out alerts with pop-up warnings to avoid giving personal data to anyone and never to press unverified links from unknown individuals.\nThis includes being aware of fake pages from the government, using 2FA verification, and steering clear of manipulative ads with scam links.\nRead next: Threads Makes An Array of Exciting Changes To The App And Here’s What to Expect",

    "text": "Billionaire businessman Elon Musk condemned Australia for its recent proposed law to ban social media access for children under 16. The owner of the microblogging platform X called it a \\\"backdoor way to control access to the internet' by all Australians. The said law was announced on X (Musk-owned social media platform) by the Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Thursday, triggering mixed opinions globally. Alanese in his post, wrote: \\\"We're introducing our bill to make 16 years the minimum age for social media.\\\" The bill was introduced in the parliament by the centre-left government, intending to implement an age-verification system to create one of the strictest social media regulations globally. The government also stated that the companies, if found violating the law or traced in the systematic breach of the law, could face a penalty of up to A$49.5 million (USD 32 million). The bill aims to restrict children's social media use, disallowing exceptions for parental consent or existing accounts. \\\"This legislation underscores our commitment to protecting children's safety and well-being online,\\\" the government stated. Similar measures have been proposed or implemented globally. In 2022, France suggested a social media ban for minors under 15 but included provisions for parental consent. In the US, existing laws mandate tech companies to obtain parental consent before accessing data of children under 13. Elon Musk’s remarks highlight his ongoing tensions with Australia's Labor government over social media regulations. In April, X challenged an Australian cyber regulator’s directive to remove posts about a stabbing incident, prompting Prime Minister Albanese to brand Musk an \\\"arrogant billionaire.\\\" Musk also criticised the government’s misinformation law, calling its approach \\\"fascist.\\\" Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News, World and around the world.",

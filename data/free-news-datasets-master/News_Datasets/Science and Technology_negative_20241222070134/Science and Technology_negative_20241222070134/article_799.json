    "text": "\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n See full bio \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Obaid Ur Rehman \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n At Tech4Gamers, I mainly cover new gaming news, leaks, and rumours. Aside from that, I love to write features about my favourite games while inserting my opinion about their different aspects.\\xa0\n\\n \\n See full bio \\n Story Highlight \\n \\n Ubisoft has faced a lot of hate and criticism this year.\\xa0 \\n That doesn\\u2019t seem to stop anytime soon, as it is under fire yet again.\\xa0 \\n A bug in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora forces you to buy The Sky Breaker DLC in order to play the base game.\\xa0 \\n \\n \\nUbisoft is likely the most hated company right now, as the gaming giant has made many questionable decisions . After multiple failed releases, the company lost a lot of its value , and it might not recover from this.\n\\n Star Wars Outlaw\\u2019s failure forced it to delay Assassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows , which will be released on 14 Feb. That said, a new report has revealed that Ubisoft is forcing players to buy DLC in order to the base game they already own ; this company can\\u2019t catch a break now, can it?\n\\n Why it matters: Gamers are already pretty concerned about not owning their digital games, so such \\u2018bugs\\u2019 that force players to buy the DLC to play the base game they already paid for would start a massive controversy.\\xa0\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNo-Chance-3671 on the Frontiers of Pandora subreddit reported that they couldn\\u2019t play the base game without buying the DLC.\n\\n Wanted to play Avatar FOP (base game, no DLCs) today and I can not load/continue my game \\u2013 it says that the Sky Breaker DLC is needed.\\xa0\n\\nThere are many people who experienced the same thing and are wondering if they have been scammed by Ubisoft . The Reddit user who initiated this report also talked to customer support about this issue.\n\\n \\nThere seems to be no way to access the save file other than buying the DLC, or the user will have to start a completely new game . Do note that this subreddit is 4 months old, and many users have reported the previous month that the issue is still not resolved.\\xa0\n\\nThere is also a discussion regarding this issue at the Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Steam community . Similarly, Smash JT on YouTube has received multiple player reports regarding this bug.\n\\n\\nThis confirms that many players were having this issue despite spending money on the base game, which they think should be illegal.\n\\nWhat do you think of this bug that forces you to buy DLC to play the base game you already spent money on? Do you think such practices should be legal? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below or join the discussion at the official Tech4Gamers forums .\n\\n",

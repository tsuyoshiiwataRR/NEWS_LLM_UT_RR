    "text": "Rumor has it today that Google is finally skipping this generation to go directly to the <a href=\"https://www.world-today-news.com/leaked-pixel-tablet-3-details-reveal-it-will-have-two-usb-c-ports-but-a-lower-tensor-g6-chip/\" title=\"Leaked Pixel Tablet 3 details reveal it will have two USB-C ports but a lower Tensor G6 chip”>Pixel Tablet 3 . The site Android Headlines indicated at the same time that kiyomi was the name given internally to this Pixel Tablet 3, but Android Authority denies this information. The Pixel Tablet 3 is reportedly equipped with a Google Tensor G6 processor, and is not expected before 2027.\nFor our part, we remain doubtful about this information and we believe that if the Pixel Tablet 2 has been canceled, everything suggests that Google is simply abandoning the tablet market. The Pixel Tablet was not very successful, and the search engine did not seek, at least in France, to promote its product. Google also has a reputation for quickly putting an end to projects that do not meet their audience, like Google Stadia, which was disconnected in a few weeks.\nThe future of Android tablets would therefore be played out by other manufacturers, such as Samsung or Xiaomi who remain invested in the subject. It remains to be seen whether Google will still continue its efforts on the software side, by adapting more of its applications to the 10-inch format and above.\n**If you were advising Google ⁢on⁤ their tablet strategy, what ‍key features ⁢or ⁣innovations⁣ would you ⁢recommend⁢ they focus on to differentiate ‍Pixel Tablets and compete effectively in ⁤a market dominated by ⁢Samsung and Apple?** ## The Future of​ Pixel Tablets: An Insightful Discussion\n**Welcome ⁣to World Today News!

Do you buy into this rumor,⁢ or ‌do you think it’s more⁣ likely Google ⁤will launch a⁣ Pixel Tablet 2 first?\n*​ **[Guest 2 Name]:**\n**Theme 2: Google’s Tablet ⁤History & Strategy**\n*‌ **Host:** Let’s look at Google’s track record with tablets. The Pixel Tablet, despite⁤ its potential, didn’t quite make a splash in the‌ market. [Guest 1 Name], considering this, how do you see ‌this potential generation skip impacting ⁤Google’s ‌motivation‌ to stay in the tablet game?\n*​ **[Guest 1 Name]:**\n* **Host:** [Guest 2 Name], Google has ⁢a history of pivoting and ⁢refocusing its efforts. ​Do you believe that even‌ if​ the Pixel Tablet⁢ 2⁣ is canceled, Google might ⁣still find ⁤a different ⁤way to ​stay relevant in the⁢ Android tablet space, perhaps through software optimization or partnerships?\n*⁢ **[Guest 2 Name]:**\n**Theme 3: The Future of Android Tablets**\n* **Host:** Looking ‌beyond Google, ‍we see strong contenders like Samsung and Xiaomi actively developing and improving their⁣ tablet offerings.

    "text": "Monday\nBattery powered doorbell will not charge via usb cable. When plugged in, nothing lights up and home app does not show it charging. I have checked the charging cord and everything is good. Doorbell will not factory reset either. Holding in the reset button in the pin hole does not change any lights or do anything either. Doorbell has 1% battery and will still work if doorbell button is pressed.\n20m ago\nHi [@Ngealy](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/618388)!\nThanks for posting in the community.\nI’m sorry for the inconveniences that you’ve been experiencing with your Nest doorbell. I can see that the doorbell is not charging. You have checked the cable, and you have also done the factory reset, but the device is still having the same behavior. No worries, I’m happy to help you find a solution.\nPlease do one more factory reset to your Nest doorbell following the next steps:\nYou can also check the next article for further information: Restart or factory reset Nest camera or doorbell.\nTell me how it goes.\nRegards,\nDaniel.",

    "text": "Chinese police have issued warnings to short video app operator Kuaishou Technology over alleged lapses in content moderation and protecting minors, according to a notice from local authorities.\\nThe Beijing-based video platform was called out for missteps that authorities say violate the country’s Cybersecurity Law, including failing to “deal in a timely manner with information prohibited by local laws from being published or transmitted” and inadequate protection of children on its platform, according to a notice published to the WeChat account of the National Cybersecurity Information Centre.\\n“The Public Security Administration … ordered [Kuaishou] to fully implement youth protection, comprehensively investigate and clean up illegal information, and remove illegal accounts,” the Cybersecurity Centre said in the notice.\\nKuaishou did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours on Friday.\\nThe administrative penalty comes as Beijing has been seeking greater control over the digital lives of the younger users. In August 2023, the country’s top internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), proposed a draft rule aimed at curbing internet addiction and fostering socialist values among minors.\\nThe agency said at the time that the rules were drafted to “improve the positive role of the internet, create a favourable network environment, prevent and intervene in minors’ internet addiction problems, and guide minors to form good internet use habits”.\\nThe rule went into effect on November 15, according to a post published to the official CAC website.\\nThe finalised rule “encourages and supports mobile terminals, apps and app distributors to join hands in building a Minor Mode” – technical controls that limit total time spent online daily, filter out inappropriate content, and prioritise the display of age-appropriate material to protect the users under the age of 18.\\nChina’s efforts to battle internet and video gaming addiction go back years. In 2019, the National Press and Publication Administration introduced measures that include real-name registration and limiting gameplay time to ensure minors do not binge on mobile games. Those rules were tightened in 2021, when the regulator limited minors to playing games for just three hours per week.\\n",

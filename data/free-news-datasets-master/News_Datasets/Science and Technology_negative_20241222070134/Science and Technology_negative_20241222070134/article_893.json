    "text": "OpenAI, the developer of the popular chatbot ChatGPT, is reportedly venturing into Google’s territory with plans for a web browser integrated with its AI technology. The company is actively pursuing partnerships, including one with Google’s long-time partner, to power specialised search features for various websites and apps, including those in the travel, food, real estate and retail sectors.Citing people who were briefed about the situation at OpenAI, a report by The Information says that the Microsoft-backed company has showcased prototypes and designs of these products to potential partners, including Condé Nast, Redfin, Eventbrite, and Priceline. These search features will leverage OpenAI's AI capabilities to provide more personalised and intuitive search experiences.OpenAI plans to power AI features in Samsung phonesFurthermore, OpenAI has reportedly engaged in discussions with Samsung to integrate its AI technology into the electronics giant’s devices. It is to be noted that OpenAI already supplies its AI technology to Apple.What makes this report interesting is that Samsung has already signed a long term partnership on AI and other areas that extend beyond Android.

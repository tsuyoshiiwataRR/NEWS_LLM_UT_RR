    "text": "Phishing emails have increasingly become a significant threat to mobile users. Cybercriminals exploit the smaller screen sizes and less comprehensive security measures on mobile devices. These attackers use tactics designed to appear legitimate and trick unsuspecting users. Understanding how these threats work and learning how to prevent them can protect you from becoming a victim. These actions can safeguard your private information and preserve your online safety. Let’s look into the ways phishing emails target mobile users and provide actionable tips to stay safe.\nThe growing threat of phishing emails\nMobile users face a unique set of challenges when it comes to [phishing emails](https://www.mywot.com/blog/phishing-emails). Cybercriminals capitalize on smaller screen sizes, simplified email displays, and increased mobile device usage. These factors combine to create a fertile ground for cyber threats. For instance, users often rush through their emails on mobile devices, making them more likely to overlook suspicious elements. Understanding these challenges can help you stay vigilant.\nStatistics showcasing our susceptibility to phishing are staggering. In 2022, the cybersecurity firm [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/ph/security/research-and-analysis/threat-reports/roundup/annual-trend-micro-email-threats-report) detected and blocked a total of 21,267,356 phishing attacks worldwide. That’s 29% more than in the previous year. Such sobering figures underline the importance of being proactive in cyber defenses. More education and awareness could help mitigate these risks.\nCommon phishing tactics\nThere are several tactics that phishers use to take advantage of mobile users. Awareness of these tricks can help you avoid being caught out:\nSuspicious activity claims\nFake emails mimicking suspicious activity or login attempts. A common tactic is trying to make the email sound urgent, and driving a user to click on a bad link or give away account details.\nPayment information issues\nYou might receive messages that claim problems with your account or payment information. Such emails try to prompt an immediate response by instilling fear of an account suspension or some other penalty.\nMalware-embedded links\nThey are emails with links that, when clicked on, install malware on the device, compromising it and exposing personal data.\nFake refund offers\nSome of the alerts include fake refund or counterfeit coupon offers, which might lure users into disclosing their personal information under the false pretense of saving money.\nThese typically involve pretending to be someone you know and trust – for example, you get an email that looks just like it was sent from your bank, or your email provider, or even from your friend or family member. These kinds of common schemes can give you a heads-up for how to be more suspicious of the suspicious emails you receive.\nWhy mobile users are vulnerable\nMobile systems typically have fewer security barriers in place than desktop systems and are therefore appealing targets for phishers. Mobile users are often less inclined to check URLs and sender details due to smaller screen sizes and simplified email layouts. The cognitive and systemic vulnerabilities specific to mobile use include the following.\nSmaller screens\nYou are less likely to see the giveaways of phishing such as the URL or email addresses on a small screen, and the scammers know this. This is why they’ll use similar-looking URLs.\nMobile apps\nThese features have been made accessible to more users with a minimum of technical expertise, and some apps might have weaker security measures that are easier to attack. If the user has given even wider permissions, it becomes even more dangerous.\nIncreased usage\nThe usage of mobile devices is also increasing, which brings more opportunities for risks. Nowadays, mobile devices are our main communication tools, shopping platforms, and bank accounts.\nMoreover, mobile users are especially likely to be in a hurry. What they see might be the first thing they check in the morning on their way to work or the last before signing off for the night at home. Caught in this check-and-dispatch mode, they might not pause to consider phishing clues. When you’re ‘on the go’, and particularly if you’re interrupted by a beep or a buzz from your smartphone while doing something else, the impulse to just get the darned thing cleared out of your inbox is hard to resist. Increased attention and vigilance can help check these habits.\nWays to protect yourself\nWhat you can do to decrease your chances of getting caught by a phishing expedition has an answer – a practice of due diligence. Here are some actionable steps to make your online experience more secure.\nVerify the sender\nCheck the sender’s email address. If it looks dubious or unusual, do not react to the email. Hackers will frequently use email addresses that closely mirror legitimate ones to fool users.\nInspect URLs\n‘Mouse-over’ or hover over links first to check their legitimacy before clicking them, and always type URLs directly into your browser if you’re not sure they take you to the right place. Phishers often include links in their emails.\nEnable two-factor authentication (2FA)\nSlap 2FA on your most sensitive accounts to make it more difficult for the bad guys to log into your accounts, even if they happen to snag your password.\nRegular software updates\nKeep the mobile operating system and applications updated. Many of these updates include patches to fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited for scams.\nInstall security software\nUse a mobile security app for pattern recognition of phishing behavior. Security software for mobile devices can provide a second layer of defense.\nEducation and awareness\nStay informed about today’s phishing techniques and spread the word. Awareness mitigates risk and bolsters a community that phishers must be careful around.\nPhishing defense requires both technology and good habits. Keeping software up-to-date and verifying emails are good protective measures. Good password hygiene – including unique and strong passwords – also has a role, particularly on mobile devices.\nActions to take if targeted\nIf you think you’re a phishing victim, there are a series of steps to take right away to limit the fallout:\nChange passwords\nMake sure that you change your password, especially if you used the same password on multiple sites so that others can’t get access to other accounts.\nEnable two-factor authentication\nIf you haven’t done it already, apply 2FA to as many accounts as possible – it’s an extra barrier that makes it a little bit harder for attackers to compromise your accounts.\nRun antivirus software\nCheck your device for viruses and other malware before and after downloading the file. That way, if the file does contain malware, it will be detected and removed from your system before it can cause any harm.\nMonitor financial statements\nCheck your financial accounts regularly for fraudulent transactions, and promptly report and act on any discrepancies you discover.\nSwift action can minimize damage from a phishing attack: report the phishing emails you receive, if they are reported by critics and tech firms, as well as fellow users, this makes the Internet a safer place and can help protect people from the damage caused by phishing scams.\nHow companies combat phishing\nBusinesses, too, need to do their part in overcoming these phishing attacks, and protecting themselves and their employees. Here are some of the measures:\nSecurity awareness training\nTrain employees regularly to spot phishing and report it. If your employees are your first line of defense against phishing attacks, they need to be educated. One way to do this is to send fake phishing emails and test employees’ vigilance and use this as an exercise to refresh security training.\nAnti-phishing add-ons\nUse a browser add-on that identifies known phishing sites before you go to them. A browser add-on will present a warning that the website it is about to take you to is on a list of known phishing sites. Some browsers have built-in protections against phishing.\nEmail filtering\nMinimize the number of phishing emails that reach your users by implementing progressive and sophisticated email filtering. Filters can mitigate many phishing attempts even before they hit your inbox.\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA)\nRequest an MFA for accessing a corporate system. This is another important blocking measure, by introducing a second factor.\nBusinesses must have multi-layered defenses against phishing. Employee training, secure software and a continuously updated system can prevent sensitive data from being given to cyber attackers.\nReporting phishing emails\nIf you want to do something about it, you can improve filtering algorithms and alert email providers to new techniques by reporting phishing attempts. So, how exactly should you report a phishing email?\nEmail reporting features\nTurn on any available in-built reporting features of email providers, such as Gmail or Outlook, to flag suspicious emails for investigation.\nNotify the impersonated company\nAlso alert the company that’s been spoofed so that it can warn other customers. Stopping a phishing attempt before it affects more people is a commendable thing.\nReport to agencies\nBy reporting phishing attempts to the [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/) (FTC) or the [Anti-Phishing Working Group](https://apwg.org/) (APWG), both of which track and study phishing tactics, you are contributing to the development of better detection and protection against these schemes.\nBy reporting phishing attempts – let’s make it a commonplace practice – a community defense against such attacks builds up. Better detection of future attempts may enable you to avoid similar scams, as well as pass the benefits on to others. The more extensive the protection, the safer we all become online.\nPreventative and protective diligence\nUsers can stay alert and ahead of phisher attackers with preventative and protective diligence. This awareness, when combined with technology, becomes the best defense against phishing. Protect your phone, be wary of phishing and keep yourself and your information safe.\nHelp others to stay safe and secure online by sharing these phishing safety tips with your friends and family.

The more we raise awareness about phishing, the better we protect ourselves and our valuable data.",

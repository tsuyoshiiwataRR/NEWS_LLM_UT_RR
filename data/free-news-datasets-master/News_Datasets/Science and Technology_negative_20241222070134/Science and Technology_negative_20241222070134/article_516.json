    "text": "3 Min Read\nChina’s decision to reduce export rebates on solar modules and components, effective 1 December, is set to increase electricity tariffs in India, creating short-term challenges but potentially paving the way for long-term benefits.\nThe rebate for modules will drop from 13% to 9%, while ancillary components like aluminium and copper wires will lose rebates entirely.\n“The change in rebate from 13% to 9% would result in an increase in price at the module level by about 2–4 cents per watt-peak. For every one cent increase in module prices, tariffs are expected to rise by 6–7 paise, leading to an overall increase of 12–28 paise per unit of electricity,\" Sabyasachi Majumdar, Senior Director at CARE Ratings, explained.\nThis price hike will also affect existing contracts. “For contracts where a portion of modules arrive after December 1, the additional cost burden due to reduced rebates will likely be passed on by Chinese manufacturers, raising electricity generation costs for Indian developers,\" Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner at EY India, added.\nDependency on China continues\nIndia remains heavily dependent on China for solar cells, with an 80% reliance that is unlikely to decrease before 2027, when domestic capacities are expected to stabilise. Majumdar noted: “While module production is becoming largely domestic, our dependency on China for upstream components like wafers and polysilicon will persist for years.”\nDespite short-term difficulties, experts see a silver lining for Indian manufacturers. The rising cost of Chinese exports could enhance India’s global competitiveness. Agarwal remarked: “This aligns with India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, indirectly making Indian manufacturers more competitive as Chinese exports become costlier.”\nIndia’s solar exports have already seen remarkable growth. According to a recent JMK Research report, Indian PV module exports surged by over 23 times between FY2022 and FY2024. This growth positions India as a reliable alternative to Southeast Asian manufacturers, particularly as the US imposes strict tariffs on Chinese imports.\nBalancing domestic and export markets\nHowever, domestic supply remains under pressure. Module production is expected to reach 28GW by FY2025, falling short of the 30GW required to meet India’s renewable energy goals.\nMajumdar warned: “Balancing export growth and domestic demand is critical. Small-scale projects like rooftop solar, which have smaller order sizes, risk delays due to the supply-demand gap.”\nThe government is promoting localised production of wafers and ingots to mitigate dependency on imports. Experts believe long-term self-sufficiency will require sustained investments and targeted policies.\nAgarwal emphasised: “The measures taken by China indirectly support India’s ambitions to become a global solar hub, but ensuring adequate domestic supply remains a pressing priority.”\nThe rebate for modules will drop from 13% to 9%, while ancillary components like aluminium and copper wires will lose rebates entirely.\n“The change in rebate from 13% to 9% would result in an increase in price at the module level by about 2–4 cents per watt-peak.

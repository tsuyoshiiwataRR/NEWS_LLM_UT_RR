    "text": "TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – Taiwan experiences the highest amount of attacks by hackers in the world, up to 15,000 per second, Digital Minister Huang Yen-nun (黃彥男) said Friday (Nov. 22).\nThe average amount of attacks was four times higher than for other countries, the minister told a Cyberday meeting in Tainan, per [CNA](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aipl/202411220120.aspx). He emphasized cybersecurity as a basic precondition, as if it was not handled well, businesses would be unable to flourish and be damaged.\nThe launch of the Ministry of Digital Affairs in 2022 underlined the resilience of Taiwan’s economic development. Its work showed the world that Taiwan was a trustworthy brand, officials said.\nIn order to improve the country’s resilience, its top intelligence agency, the National Security Bureau, is setting up a national cybersecurity response center, per [Radio Taiwan International](https://www.rti.org.tw/news/view/id/2228786). The new structure will allow departments to share information and protect government and private targets from hackers, officials said.",

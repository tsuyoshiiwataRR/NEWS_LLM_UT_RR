    "text": "Ghosts of Tabor, the high-energy extraction shooter built exclusively for VR, has been delayed from coming to PSVR2 until early 2025, the developer has revealed. It was originally intended to be released with the ‘December wipe’ but owing to a complex development path, the team has had to delay the launch by a few months.\nA Little Longer to Extract Ghosts of Tabor has been dubbed ‘Escape from Tarkov VR’ by some, and that’s damn close to being true. Since being released in March 2023, Ghosts of Tabor has turned heads in the VR space, pulling in thousands of positive reviews and really standing out as the go-to option for anyone seeking the most immersive extraction shooter experience possible.\nIn a post on social media and the game’s Discord server, it was explained:\nWe know the excitement around the PSVR2 launch of Ghosts of Tabor is through the roof – and trust us, we share that excitement! However, I want to be completely upfront with you: porting Tabor to PSVR2 has proven to be more complex than we anticipated, both for us and our partners.\nTo deliver the experience you deserve, we’ll need a bit more time. We’ve allocated additional resources to make this final push and are working tirelessly to bring it to you as early as possible in 2025.\nPre-orders will open once we’ve secured a timeline and confirmed the launch date.\nIn Ghosts of Tabor, players enter harsh environments hellbent on surviving, and to that end, they must scavenge resources, eat, drink, and fight other players, all while seeking to secure top-tier loot and successfully extracting from the map to land a win. It has been praised for its detail and depth, and from customisation to in-game trading, there’s plenty of meat on Tabor’s bones.\nHave you played Ghosts of Tabor yet? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum .",

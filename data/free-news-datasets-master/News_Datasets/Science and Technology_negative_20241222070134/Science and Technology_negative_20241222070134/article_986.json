    "text": "Quick Links\nWhen buying a new phone, you can purchase a premium warranty as an additional option for protection against accidental damage. While these premium warranties serve a purpose and can be helpful, I choose not to buy them for various reasons.\n1 Premium Warranty Doesn't Come Cheap\nModern smartphones are already expensive, and despite that, premium warranties don't come cheap either. According to [Apple's support page](https://www.apple.com/support/products/iphone/), AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss for the iPhone 16 Pro series is $13.49/month or a one-time payment of $269 for two years. Standard AppleCare+ costs $9.99/month or $199 paid one time.\nOn the other hand, Samsung's Care+ with Theft and Loss also starts at $8/month and goes up to $18/month for three years, depending on the tier (or $129 to $349 paid once for a two-year warranty). That's a lot to spend on top of the already expensive smartphone prices and can add up over time, especially if you opt for the monthly payment plan.\n2 Existence of Manufacturer's Warranty and Consumer Protections\nThe second reason I chose not to purchase a premium warranty is that all phones from reputable companies have a manufacturer's warranty. The standard manufacturer's warranty covers defects either in material or workmanship for at least one year. Albeit limited, this warranty assures me that unless it's my mistake, the company will address any issue arising from manufacturing defects that aren't in my control.\nSo, if my device has a problem, I can get a replacement or repair for freeâ€”it doesn't matter if I purchased a premium warranty.\nConsumer protection laws available in many regions also guarantee protection ensuring that if a product is faulty or doesn't meet specific standards, I deserve free repairs or replacements as a buyer, regardless of the company's warranty. Together, manufacturer warranty and consumer protection laws give me peace of mind, knowing that I'm covered for all issues that aren't in my control.\n3 I Use Protective Accessories\nOne of the key [reasons to purchase a premium warranty with your phone](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-purchase-premium-warranty-with-phone/) is coverage against accidental damage. That's valid, but I don't see the need for such when I have an alternative: using protective accessories. Such accessories are cheap and play a key role in minimizing the chances of accidental damage. I use different accessories to [protect my phone from drops and scratches](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-protect-phone-from-drops-and-scratches/).\nMy three go-to accessories include a phone case, which helps safeguard the body, a tempered glass screen protector for the screen, and a lens protector for the camera. These three accessories save my device from potential damage in the most delicate areas caused by accidental drops. So, instead of purchasing a premium warranty, I invest in protective accessories to safeguard my device from damage.\n4 I Upgrade Every Two Years\nFor someone who upgrades every two years, the value of a premium warranty isn't worth it. Paying for a two-year or three-year warranty is less appealing when I factor in the standard one-year limited warranty available for free. The two-year upgrade cycle means that when I experience significant hardware issues like reduced battery health, I will be ready for my next upgrade.\nHowever, a premium warranty would make sense for someone who plans to keep their phone for more than two years.\nI agree premium warranties come with their perks, unlike standard manufacturer warranties. For example, [smartphone screens are expensive to replace](https://www.makeuseof.com/heres-why-phone-screens-are-so-expensive-to-replace/), and you get priority support. However, I don't feel the need for it because of how I use my phone and how often I upgrade it.",

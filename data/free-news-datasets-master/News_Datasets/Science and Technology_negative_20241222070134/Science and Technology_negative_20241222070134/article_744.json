    "text": "In a 23-page document filed late Wednesday, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) urged a judge to dismantle Alphabet’s Google, compelling the tech giant to divest its Chrome browser, share search data with competitors, and take additional steps, including imposing restrictions to prevent Android from prioritising Google’s own search engine, to dismantle its monopoly in online search.The sale of Chrome “will permanently stop Google’s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet,” Justice Department lawyers argued in their filing.What it means for GoogleFed prosecutors are intensifying their crackdown on Google in a case initially filed during the closing months of then-President Donald Trump's first term. Officials say that the proposals’ main goal is to stop Google from using its dominant search engine to unlawfully suppress competition and hinder innovation. The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired. The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages, the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations.Unsurprisingly, Google looks at it differently. Kent Walker, Google’s chief legal officer, criticised the Justice Department’s proposal as “wildly overbroad” in a blog post. It would break a range of Google products - even beyond search - that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives, he said.What nextGoogle has the opportunity to present its own proposed fixes in December, while federal regulators are planning to submit a revised edition of their proposals by early March. Court hearings on the proposed measures are set to begin in April, with US district judge Amit Mehta expected to deliver a final ruling before Labour Day.The remedies trial will take place after the Trump administration assumes office in January, taking over oversight of the DoJ, which could impact the punishments it ultimately pursues. While Trump has previously expressed doubts about whether breaking up Google aligns with US national interests, recent nominations from his transition team have favoured those who have been critical for big tech firms.Google is likely to appeal the case after the remedy hearings, which means the case could drag on for years in the courts.",

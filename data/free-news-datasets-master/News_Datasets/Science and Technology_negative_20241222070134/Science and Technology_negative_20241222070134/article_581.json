    "text": "A group of chemical compounds used to disinfect water for one-third of the US population and millions of others globally produces a potentially toxic byproduct, according to new research published Thursday, sparking calls for an \"immediate\" investigation into possible health impacts.\nInorganic chloramines have been used for decades to remove pathogens from public water supplies.\nThough chlorine remains the most widely used disinfectant in the US and globally, chloramines have increasingly replaced it in many systems to reduce certain byproducts linked to bladder and colon cancer, low birth weight, and miscarriage.\nToday, more than 113 million Americans rely on chloraminated drinking water, with the compound also in use across Canada, Asia, and Europe.\n\"However, chloramines themselves decompose into products that are poorly characterized,\" said Julian Fairey, lead author of the study published in the journal Science, during a press briefing.\nOne such product, identified more than 40 years ago but left chemically unresolved, was simply dubbed the \"unidentified product.\"\nFairey and his team have finally cracked the mystery.\nUsing a combination of traditional chemistry methods and modern tools like high-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, they identified the compound as \"chloronitramide anion.\"\nMore from this section Bragg suggests suspending Trump's hush money sentencing, perhaps for 4 years Five tourists dead after suspected tainted alcohol poisoning in Laos UN nuclear chief welcomes Iran's 'concrete step' on uranium stockpile The compound was detected in all 40 chloraminated drinking water samples tested, with concentrations reaching up to 100 micrograms per liter -- exceeding typical regulatory limits for disinfection byproducts, which range between 60 and 80 micrograms per liter.\nAlthough toxicological studies have yet to be conducted, the researchers sounded a warning.\n\"The chemical structure looks concerning, as does the concentrations at which this compound is forming, so we certainly think health effects studies are warranted,\" Fairey said.\nTheir study calls for the compound to be \"an immediate candidate\" for quantification in public waters and for closer health and toxicity studies.\nWater utilities could consider reverting to chlorine, Fairey suggested, though this would require secondary disinfectants to neutralize the known toxic byproducts chlorine produces.\nWith further study and regulatory action likely years away, the researchers recommended home filtration systems using activated carbon blocks for people who are concerned.\nia/aha\nOriginally published on doc.afp.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .",

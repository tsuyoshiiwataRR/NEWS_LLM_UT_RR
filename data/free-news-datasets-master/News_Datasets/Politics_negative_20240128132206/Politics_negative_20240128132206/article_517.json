    "text": "Streaming Now The decade's most triggering comedy Former President Donald Trump laid out his foreign policy differences with President Joe Biden Wednesday, blasting his political rival for allowing Iran to “get rich” under his watch. Trump spoke with [Just the News](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/all-things-trump/newsmaker-interview-trump-puts-iran-europeans-and-antisemites) in a wide-ranging interview that touched on the increasingly unstable Middle East and Iran’s involvement with terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas. During his interview, Trump focused on his foreign policy record, saying that Biden’s strategy has created chaos in the Middle East and put the U.S. in an undesirable position. “Iran was allowed to get rich because Joe Biden allowed them to,” Trump said. “So he could say whatever he wants. But he’s the reason for this. He’s an incompetent president. He’s a compromised president, totally compromised. But he allowed them to get rich.” “But worse than being rich, because of the money, because of what they have, they will have within a short period of time nuclear weapons. And that is never something that can be allowed to happen,” Trump added. Under the Trump administration, the U.S. pulled out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, which [gave](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-nuclear-deal-explained-11610564572) Iran access to over $100 billion in oil revenues that were previously frozen by U.S. sanctions. Trump had sought to restrict Iran’s missile program and push the Tehran regime to sever its ties to terrorism, but Iran refused to negotiate. Shortly after Biden won back the White House for Democrats, however, the administration began working out a new Iran Nuclear Deal. Iran backs terrorist groups such as Hamas and the Houthis, which are actively warring against Israel. The Houthis have also recently targeted ships in the Middle East, and the U.S. has [shot down](https://www.timesofisrael.com/witnesses-report-2-explosions-off-sinai-coast-strange-object-falling-into-water/) at least 12 drones and five missiles launched by the terrorist group. Earlier this week, Iran appeared to [claim responsibility](https://www.dailywire.com/news/iran-and-hamas-feud-over-what-fueled-oct-7-massacre-of-israelis) for Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, during which terrorists brutally murdered at least 1,200 people. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps reportedly said the terrorist attack on Israel was a response to the assassination of top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani by the U.S. in 2020, which was carried out under the orders of Trump. “Iran was broke. They didn’t have any money to get around. I put sanctions on. I put everything on, and told countries, China, many countries, India, France, ‘don’t buy oil … you buy any oil, we’re not going to do business with you. And we’re going to put tariffs on all the products that do get through, We’re not going to do business,’” said Trump, the frontrunner in the Republican presidential primary.

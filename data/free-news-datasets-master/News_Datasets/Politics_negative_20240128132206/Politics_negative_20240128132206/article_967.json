    "text": "Britain remains firmly in the grip of a cost of living crisis , despite what the Conservatives may claim.\nHousehold bills for essentials are, on average, £326 more than they were a year ago. Food inflation is still averaging nearly 10% and rents and mortgages are set to rise again over the next 12 months. Yet wages are stagnant. From 1970 to 2007, salaries grew an average 33% each decade. Since the Tories came to power in 2010, they have flatlined – a damning indictment of the party’s economic mismanagement.\nThe fall in inflation is welcome but with so many price rises, few people will even notice the difference. The Resolution Foundation think-tank reckons typical households here are now 9% poorer than their French counterparts. Low-income families are 27% poorer. Labour’s first task, if elected, is to build an economy that works for all. A prosperous country can only be achieved if people can find secure work that pays them a fair wage.\nClimate of fear The havoc caused by Storm Gerrit is a sobering reminder of the power of nature. The tornado which swept through Greater Manchester has damaged hundreds of buildings, ripping off roofs and blowing down walls. Elsewhere, homes have been flooded and travel disrupted. Every effort must be made to help those affected. We also need to be better prepared for severe weather events. What were once deemed to be freak ­incidents are only going to become more frequent as a result of the climate crisis.\nGrrreat escape A wildlife park is racing against time to reunite three one-year-old lion cubs saved from a Ukrainian zoo with their mum. The family of big cats will surely have pride of place in their new Yorkshire home if the dedicated staff pull off the rescue.",

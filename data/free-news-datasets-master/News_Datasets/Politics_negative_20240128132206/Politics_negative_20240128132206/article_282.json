    "text": "2023-12-28 22:00:29 Argentina’s largest union has called for a general strike to protest against new President Javier Milei’s radical economic reforms. The strike is scheduled to take place on January 24th, as the CGT trade union federation announced on Thursday. Union leader Héctor Daer also announced a protest demonstration in front of the Argentine parliament during the debate on Milei’s first draft laws. Milei’s decrees and draft laws for comprehensive economic deregulation were “targeted against the entire society,” Daer said. Milei wants to concentrate all political power “with the president.” When he took office on December 10th, Milei promised the heavily indebted South American country a “shock therapy”. First, the ultra-liberal right-wing populist introduced a decree with which he wants to change or abolish 350 existing laws, for example in tenancy and labor law. In order to reduce government spending, 7,000 jobs in the public sector are to be cut. Milei, a 53-year-old political newcomer, has taken over Latin America’s third-largest economy in the midst of a severe economic crisis: Inflation has risen to more than 160 percent and more than 40 percent of the population lives in poverty. 1703801412 #General #strike #Argentine #President #Milei",

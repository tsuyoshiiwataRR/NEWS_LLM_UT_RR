    "text": "Campaign Adam Frisch on Boebert switching districts: Proves she ‘is only in politics for herself’ Democratic congressional candidate Adam Frisch called out Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) on Thursday over her decision to change districts for the 2024 cycle , avoiding a second face-off with the former Aspen city councilor. “This just proves Lauren Boebert was never committed to the communities of CO03,” Frisch said on X , formerly Twitter. “She is only in politics for herself.” “Boebert is running scared from CD-3 because she knows she can’t match our campaign’s ability to connect with voters and the hard work we have put in to provide them with a common sense voice in Congress …” he said in a statement. Boebert announced Wednesday that she will run in Colorado’s 4th District in 2024, currently held by the retiring Rep. Ken Buck (R). Boebert narrowly defeated Frisch in 2022 for the 3rd District seat and has trailed the Democrat in fundraising and early polls so far. The move opens the GOP nomination to a primary challenger, who could have better odds against Frisch than the controversial Boebert. The district is considered a toss-up for the 2024 election, according to the Cook Political Report . Frisch has raised $7.7 million for his campaign to Boebert’s $2.2 million, according to campaign finance filings. With the switch, Boebert enters a crowded GOP primary to replace Buck. But if she comes out on top in the primary, she is almost guaranteed to stay in Congress because the 4th District is the most conservative in the state. The Colorado Republican Party also criticized Boebert’s shift . “From a party perspective, we certainly don’t think it was the best move,” party chair Dave Williamson said. “We felt that she was best suited for Congressional District Three and that she was in the best position to win reelection and retain that for Republicans.” Frisch said his campaign strategy won’t change with Boebert gone. “From Day 1 of this race, I have been squarely focused on defending rural Colorado’s way of life, and offering common sense solutions to the problems facing the families of Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District,” he said. “My focus will remain the same.” [Adam Frisch]( https://thehill.com/tag/adam-frisch/ ) [Colorado]( https://thehill.com/tag/colorado/ ) [colorado house election]( https://thehill.com/tag/colorado-house-election/ ) [Ken Buck]( https://thehill.com/people/ken-buck/ ) [Lauren Boebert]( https://thehill.com/people/lauren-boebert/ ) Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

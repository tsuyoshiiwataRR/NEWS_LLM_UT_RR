    "text": "Responding to the data, a Home Office source said ministers expected a “zero tolerance” approach to all crimes committed by police, with forces agreeing in September to pursue “all lines of investigation for all crimes.” , without exception”.\nThe source said: “Since March, there have been record numbers of police and more than £500m extra has been invested. “These additional resources should result in a significant increase in the number of crimes solved.”\nThe figures emerge from the Telegraph’s analysis of the results of inspections of all 43 forces in 2021/22 against eight criteria.\nForces are rated on metrics including looking after their workforce, offering good value for money and treating the public with respect, but when judged solely on crime investigation, ratings fall.\nThey scored worse on these metrics than on other criteria such as crime prevention, treating the public with fairness and respect, and value for money.\nNo force was rated “outstanding” in either investigating crime or responding to the public. Outstanding is the top level of five levels of performance, which then range from good, adequate, requiring improvement, and inadequate.\nThree forces were deemed inadequate to investigate crimes and 19 of them were judged to “require improvement”. Eight were assessed as “inadequate” in their response to the public, and another 17 “required improvement.”\nThe Telegraph’s analysis was based on inspections from 2021/22, covering all 43 forces over the same period to allow a fair comparison. The actions of five forces – the Metropolitan Police, West Midlands, Devon and Cornwall, Staffordshire and Wiltshire – are so worrying that they are currently under special measures.",

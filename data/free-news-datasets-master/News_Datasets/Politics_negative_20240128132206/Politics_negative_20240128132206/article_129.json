She went on to become an NCAA champion.{/p}{p}Thomas's participation in women's events was followed by the creation of “Fairness in Women’s Sports Acts,” legislation that aims to require athletes to compete based on biological sex.{/p}{p}While anchoring \\\"SportsCenter\\\" for ESPN, Steele frequently expressed opposition to Thomas and other transgender females competing in women's sports on social media. In an {a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/Outkick/status/1739993995311272221\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"https://twitter.com/Outkick/status/1739993995311272221\\\"}interview {/a}with women's sports activist Riley Gaines this week, she claimed her comments led to internal backlash at work.{/p}{p}“I was asked to stop tweeting about it,” Steele said. “I was asked to stop doing anything, saying anything about it on social media because I was offending others at the company.

Speaking to Gaines, Steele explained the messages were part of the reason why she felt so strongly about the suit.{br}{/p}{p}“I already had the lawsuit going. I didn’t know what how it was going to end. But I literally said, this is the hill I will die on 100% because it’s facts,” she said. “This is not even my opinion about a vaccine mandate or whatever, these are facts.

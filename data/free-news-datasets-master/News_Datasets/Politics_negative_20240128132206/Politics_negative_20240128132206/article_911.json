    "text": "Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images\nPoliticians have historically been well-spoken, which is an important quality in a person looking to charm the masses.\nHowever, those with that quality seem to be few and far between these days.\nEven the leader of the free world, President Joe Biden, seems lost and confused more often than not.\nWhen the president and first lady answered calls on a Christmas hotline, one caller phoned in to politely say, “Let’s go Brandon.”\n“Let’s go Brandon, I agree,” Biden responded, completely oblivious, while Jill laughed nervously.\nAnd though politicians like Biden might be destroying not only our trust but our nation, sometimes it’s hard not to laugh at them.\nDave Rubin knows that all too well.\n“It’s just so sad. Like, honestly, it’s funny, but it’s sad. He doesn’t know what he’s saying. He doesn’t know what he’s doing,” Rubin says, adding, “Let’s go Brandon, oh, my God.”\nFetterman joins Biden among the politicians with the worst gaffes, but according to Rubin, he’s no longer worthy of the laughs.\n“I don’t know that I can really make fun of John Fetterman anymore. He is probably the sanest, most functional Democrat in the entire Senate,” Rubin says.\nOne politician who Rubin still can laugh at is Representative Eric Swalwell, who blatantly farted on MSNBC while talking to Chris Matthews, who was later fired.\n“Swalwell farts and moves up in his chair and he just looks like he’s going to fart. He also banged the Chinese spy and should probably be in jail,” Rubin comments.\nWant more from Dave Rubin?\nTo enjoy more honest conversations, free speech, and big ideas with Dave Rubin,\nsubscribe to BlazeTV — the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.\nNews, opinion, and entertainment for people who love the American way of life.\nBlazeTV\n Blaze ",

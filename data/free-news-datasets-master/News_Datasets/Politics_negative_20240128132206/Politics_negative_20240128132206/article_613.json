    "text": "The Government are under pressure to pass new laws to tackle unauthorised entry to football fixtures, following a probe into the chaos of the Euro 2020 final at Wembley. Currently, there is a surprising lack of criminal penalty to punish those trying to enter stadiums with fake tickets or through force. But MPs are pushing to ensure this is tackled via the Unauthorised Entry to Football Matches Bill, which would allow a banning order to be imposed on conviction. As well as the disorder at Wembley, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee also studied scenes experienced by Liverpool supporters at the Champions League final in Paris last year. In their report, released on Friday, the committee describe the treatment of English fans as 'disgraceful' and say greater collaboration is needed between police forces, at home and aboard. The Government are under pressure to pass new laws to tackle unauthorised entry to matches There is a lack of criminal penalty to punish those trying to enter stadiums with fake tickets Dame Caroline Dinenage has admitted that there is much work to be done in terms of preventing disorder at football matches Your browser does not support iframes. They are also calling for the expansion of safe standing trials and for a crackdown on the increasing use of Class A drugs at stadiums. Dame Caroline Dinenage, chair of the CMS committee, said: 'Sadly, the rise in disorder at football post-pandemic, and near disasters at Wembley and in Paris, have shown there is much to be done. 'The Government, police, clubs and governing bodies all have a role to play.'",

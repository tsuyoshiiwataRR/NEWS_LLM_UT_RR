    "text": "'Ignorant and stupid': GOP senator dragged on social media for comment about Civil War and slavery After presidential candidate and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley failed to condemn slavery when answering a question about the cause of the Civil War, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) decided to weigh in with a comment of his own. \"The Civil War started because the American people elected an anti-slavery Republican as president and Democrats revolted rather than accept minor restrictions on the expansion of slavery to the western territories,\" [Cotton posted to X](https://twitter.com/TomCottonAR/status/1740423719108178006) (formerly Twitter) on Thursday. Cotton's tweet was met with almost universal scorn on the social media platform, with journalists and pundits pointing out the Arkansas Republican's false equivalency of antebellum-era politics with today's very different political environment.

This partisan sea change happened through the 1960s, '70s and '80s,\" former Chicago Tribune editor Mark Jacob [tweeted](https://twitter.com/MarkJacob16/status/1740452537386328143). \"It's explained in those history books that Republicans don't want you to read.\" Liberal social media personality Ron Filipowski piled on in a similar fashion, calling Cotton's tweet \"another ignorant and stupid analogy.\" \"This Republican Party doesn’t even resemble the one from 2015 much less 1860,\" Filipowski [tweeted](https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1740447671972991441). \"And the white southern Dixiecrats all switched to Republicans in the 1970-80s, so the Democratic Party today also in no way resembles that of 1860.\" Daily Beast columnist Wajahat Ali [went even further](https://twitter.com/WajahatAli/status/1740445965629469092), reminding his followers that it isn't Democrats but Republicans that today are defending the preservation of Confederate monuments.

That's Tom Cotton's GOP,\" Ali tweeted. \"If Lincoln was a Republican today, the MAGA extremists would probably try to assassinate him.\" And in response to Cotton's [follow-up tweet](https://twitter.com/TomCottonAR/status/1740423721586929719) in which he wrote that \"Democrats would sooner tear the country apart than treat all citizens equally before the law, regardless of color,\" Ali [fired back](https://twitter.com/WajahatAli/status/1740446203395924420). \"Tom Cotton will support Trump for President who cited Hitler and said immigrants poison the blood of this country and incited a failed insurrection, but go on about equality and tearing the country apart,\" he wrote. South Carolina-based pediatrician Dr. Michael O'Brien was simple in his criticism, [tweeting](https://twitter.com/DrOBrienMD/status/1740446737121354184), \"Tom Cotton is a prime example of why we should never ban books.\" READ MORE: [Tom Cotton slammed for boosting conspiracy theories about journalists](https://www.alternet.org/tom-cotton-journalists/) [John Stoehr - Alternet.org ›](https://www.alternet.org/author/johnstoehr) ['How fascists act': Trump slammed for demanding Biden weaponize government to help him ›](https://www.alternet.org/news-politics/donald-trump-joe-biden/) [Lauren Boebert says liberals want Earth Day to be about climate change 'to divide us' ›](https://www.alternet.org/boebert-liberals-earth-day-divide/)",

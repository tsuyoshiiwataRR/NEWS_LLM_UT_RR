    "text": "You may think that the corporate media are full of Democrats based on their biased coverage of most topics and the incestuous relationship between media outlets and Democratic staffing offices. You would be right, but now, there is a number you can tie to that analysis: 3.4%.\nThat is the number of American journalists who are Republicans, according to a study from Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Public Communications. The studies of the partisan lean of journalists stretch back to 1971, and the most recent iteration found that about 3.4% of journalists are members of one of the two major political parties.\nLAUREN BOEBERT’S DISTRICT SWAP IS GIFT TO GOP, BUT REELECTION OBSTACLES REMAIN\nFor Democrats, that number was 36.4%. That is up from the most recent study in 2013, which found that 28.1% of journalists were Democrats. The share of Republican journalists has been cut in half from 7.1%. Just over half of journalists claim to be independents, but you can probably reliably guess that many of them would be Democratic-leaning as well.\nYou don’t need to look hard to find examples that reinforce this. staffers threw a tantrum when the outlet published Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) arguing that the federal government should use force to stop violent Black Lives Matter riots, the culmination of several outrages at the outlet over pieces that went against its liberal slant. There is nary a peep from those same outraged figures when the outlet publishes actual terrorists, including a Hamas mayor earlier this week.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nThe bias is plain to see in its coverage of arrested politicians (and which party they belong to) or of President Joe Biden’s son . CNN personalities rebelled against Chris Licht when he tried to bring some balance to the partisan network, ultimately leading to his firing. Many of these outlets have abandoned any pretense of fair reporting on contentious topics, including gun control and abortion. It may be true that only a quarter of journalists call themselves Democrats, but you can imagine that a far greater number vote that way when the time comes.\nIf you want to know why trust in media is at rock bottom and is continuing to burrow further underground, this is part of the reason why. The other part is that many journalists pretend that they are impartial professionals who stay above the fray and must never have their motivations or biases questioned. It isn’t “misinformation” or politicians accusing journalists of being “fake news” that have eroded media trust. It is, and always has been, the fault of the media themselves.\nLatest American Israeli woman believed to have been held hostage by Hamas was killed on Oct. 7 By: Misty Severi\n'Non-sanctuary' Illinois county puts up signs telling migrant buses to stay away By: Rachel Schilke\nAmazon Prime to become latest streaming platform to include ads By: Asher Notheis\nVideos\nTrump campaign slams Biden on US-Mexico border in ad: 'The world burns'\nLouisiana joins list of states considering disqualifying Trump from primary ballot\nBiden chides Trump over Christmas Day 'rot in hell' wish\nJudge upholds redrawn Georgia congressional map in win for Republicans Newsletters\nSign up now to get the Washington Examiner’s breaking news and timely commentary delivered right to your inbox.",

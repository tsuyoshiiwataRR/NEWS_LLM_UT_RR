    "text": "2023-12-28 16:53:00 It won’t be this time. The Constitutional Council, which delivered its verdict on the 2024 finance bill this Thursday, retorted the allocation of regulated savings (Livret A, LDDS, etc.) to financing the defense industry. The latter judge that this measure had no place in a finance law, without however excluding the adoption of such a measure in another text. « The censorship of these various provisions does not prejudge the conformity of their content with other constitutional requirements. It is open to the legislator, if he deems it useful, to adopt such measures again. » by a vector other than a finance law, however, estimate the Sages in their press release. As a reminder, this amendment tabled by the president of the defense committee of the National Assembly, Thomas Gassilloud, the special rapporteur for the defense budget, Christophe Plassard, and Jean-Louis Thiériot was taken up by the government in the 2024 Budget The latter aims to open the channeling of non-centralized savings from Livret A and Sustainable and Inclusive Development Accounts (LDDS) to companies in the Defense Industrial and Technological Base (BITD), particularly SMEs sometimes in great difficulty finding financing. with banks and investment funds. This should therefore be a new windfall for the defense sector since the outstanding amounts of the LDDS and the Livret A amount respectively to 145 billion euros and 406 billion. An amendment in support of the arms industry When the amendment was included in the law, the deputies behind it were delighted. “The resumption of our amendment is a strong sign of government support for our defense industrial and technological base which will allow, with the visibility provided by the Military Programming Law, to strengthen France’s sovereignty and open up export opportunities. to our defense sector »said the deputy (Horizons) Christophe Plassard, in a press release published at the beginning of November. And for good reason, despite the war in Ukraine, banks do not show overwhelming enthusiasm for financing SMEs and startups of the defense industry. Thus, the information report on the war economy published by Christophe Plassard on March 29 had the observation that BITD companies are increasingly faced with difficulties in accessing private financing. Banks and financial institutions are increasingly reluctant to finance the BITD “for fear of American extraterritorial sanctions” et “for fear of NGOs and seeing their reputation tarnished”, he recalled. This reluctance of the banks, which have “tendency to over-interpret compliance rules”, “remains a major obstacle to innovation and the transformation of SMEs into ETIs” of the sector, he estimated. 1703802690 #Constitutional #Council #rejects #allocation #booklet #defense #companies",

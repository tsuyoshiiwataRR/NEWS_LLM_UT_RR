The Detroit-based powerhouse seeks to retrieve a whopping $108 million in taxes, alongside an additional $13 million in interest, which, according to GM, had been unjustly levied from 2016 onwards.\nThe filing, lodged on Friday in both the California Superior Court and the County of San Francisco, argues that the city demanded GM pay more taxes than necessary. The contention revolves around the inclusion of GM’s Cruise self-driving car unit as part of its overall revenue generation. Despite the city associating Cruise’s operations with a $3 billion worldwide revenue stream, GM maintains that this autonomous vehicle division operates independently.\nWhile Cruise is indeed based in San Francisco and was bought by GM in 2016, GM emphasizes that the two businesses have distinctly different operations and revenue architectures. They have established agreements that ensure both entities function “at arm’s length.”\nGM’s legal document states that the automaker’s sales in San Francisco were relatively marginal in 2022, roughly amounting to $677,000 in goods. Furthermore, GM insists that its footprint in the city is quite limited, with no employees, manufacturing units, physical locations, or dealerships present.\nThe City Attorney’s Office, when contacted, revealed that they are currently examining the lawsuit, promising to retaliate in court. The deputy press secretary, Alex Shorter-Barrett, represented the office during this exchange.\nIn related news,\nCruise has recently faced its share of turbulence. The CEO stepped down in November after the autonomous fleet was recalled for software updates following a series of accidents. This decision was particularly triggered by an incident on Oct. 2, where a Cruise vehicle ended up dragging a pedestrian to the side of the road after being hit by another car. This unfortunate event raised questions about the safety of the autonomous vehicles, leading California to revoke Cruise’s driverless permits, labeling them as unfit for public operation.\nRecent News\nPortland International Airport Welcomes Therapy Llamas\nThe Portland International Airport has welcomed a comforting pair of therapy llamas to help ease the stress of holiday travelers.\nBillionaire Lei Jun Aims To Beat Tesla and Porsche With Xiaomi’s First EV\nThe billionaire co-founder of Xiaomi, Lei Jun, has unveiled an extensive plan to enter China’s electric automotive market and compete with car giants such as Tesla and Porsche.\nNew Year’s Eve Revelers Paying Upwards of $12K to Ring in 2024 in Times Square\nTimes Square may be the place to be as far as ringing in New Year’s Eve.

    "text": "Hezbollah announced that Israel recently attempted to penetrate civilian cameras installed in front of homes, shops, and institutions in the front villages, which are connected to the Internet, to benefit from the visual material it provides to collect [information](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/information/) related to it and its members in order to target them. Hezbollah asked citizens, “especially in the front villages in the vicinity of which resistance activities are taking place, to disconnect the private cameras in front of their homes, shops, and institutions from the Internet, and to contribute to further blinding the enemy to some of the activities or movements carried out by the resistance and its mujahideen in the region.” . He said that Israel’s motive for penetrating civilian cameras is “to compensate for the loss after the Islamic resistance operations that targeted most of the Israeli enemy’s cameras and military equipment at the front edge on the Lebanese-Palestinian border. The enemy lost much of the ability to see and eavesdrop to target the resistance and monitor their movements.” 2023-12-28 18:47:00 #Israel #penetrates #cameras #homes #shops #south.. #Hezbollah #asked #citizens",

    "text": "In a setback to the AAP in Haryana, two of its senior leaders have quit the party. [Nirmal Singh](https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/bigg-boss-12-contestant-nirmal-singh-5358985/), a former minister and the AAP’s national joint secretary, and Chitra Sarwara, a vice-president in the party’s Haryana unit, submitted their resignations to the [Rajya Sabha](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/parliament-monsoon-session-live-updates-rajya-sabha-lok-sabha-8035871/) MP and AAP Haryana incharge Sushil Gupta Thursday citing “personal reasons.” The leader and daughter are likely to return to Congress in the first week of January. Both had joined the AAP in April 2022 after leaving the Congress. Confirming their next course of action, Nirmal Singh said that they would join the Congress in the presence of former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, state party chief Udai Bhan and the state’s party affairs in-charge Deepak Babaria in New [Delhi](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/) on January 5. A four-time MLA Nirmal Singh had turned a Congress rebel ahead of the 2019 Assembly polls. The father-daughter duo then contested fromAmbala City and Ambala Cantt constituencies as independent candidates. Later, they also formed the Haryana Democratic Front, a political outfit.",

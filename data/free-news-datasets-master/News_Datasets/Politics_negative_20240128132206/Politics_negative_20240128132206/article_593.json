    "text": "Migrants crossing the English Channel (Image: Getty) Keir Starmer's asylum plans would \"plunge our immigration system into a new depth of chaos\", a leading think tank has warned.\nLabour sources have floated the idea of allowing refugees to claim asylum at UK embassies across the world.\nBut Migration Watch warned the \"absurd\" idea would be unaffordable, harm diplomatic relations and \"undermine border control even more greatly\".\nThose refused asylum could then attempt to cross the Channel on a small boat, the think tank said.\nMigrants crossing the English Channel (Image: Getty) Trending Alp Mehmet, Chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: “The asylum scheme is already in chaos. The government should drop their scheme for an annual cap which would be a prime target for the asylum lobby.\n“The public are seriously, and rightly concerned about the huge strains imposed on public services, communities and especially housing.\n“Over the last two years immigration and asylum have added the population of Birmingham to the UK population. The public have already had enough. Now is the time for sensible caution.\n“Meanwhile Labour’s scheme to allow asylum claimants to make applications at UK embassies in Europe would plunge our immigration asylum system into a new depth of chaos.”\nOutlining why they believe the plan would be so chaotic, the think-tank said: “Labour’s absurd scheme to open up UK embassies abroad to asylum claims poses an even greater threat to the integrity of the system and would undermine border control even more gravely.\n“This is because any UK office overseas that was charged with considering applications would likely be flooded with them.\n“Indeed, it is likely that foreign governments would refuse to agree to their establishment lest those who failed should remain on their territory.\n“Furthermore, those declined at an overseas British office might well move on to France and try their luck crossing the Channel.\n“The cost of opening and manning offices overseas would be much better spent helping far more people in greater difficulty.”\nHowever, ministers were also warned plans for an annual cap on the number of refugees allowed to settle in the UK must be scrapped.\nThe limit – set to be agreed by Parliament from 2025 - would not include those arriving under existing emergency schemes set up in response to the Ukraine war, the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan or the crisis in Hong Kong.\nThe authors said this would lead to the UK taking more refugees “year-on-year”, costing taxpayers billions of pounds more than the £4bn already being spent.\nMigration Watch also warned plans to expand the number of safe and legal routes to the UK would exacerbate pressure on the asylum system.\nBecome an Express Premium member\nSupport fearless journalism\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free\nGet super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial",

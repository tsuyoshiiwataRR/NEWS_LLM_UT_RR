    "text": "Stefanik blasts New York court for allowing mail-in voting law to take effect: 'lawless' State Republicans are expected to appeal the ruling. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., on Thursday blasted the Albany Supreme Court's decision to allow New York's new early voting law to take effect ahead of a special election to fill the seat of former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y. \"The decision to dismiss our request for an injunction to halt the implementation of mass unregulated mail-in early voting is just another example of New York’s lawless and rampant corruption,\" Stefanik wrote in a press release. \"The New York Constitution is very clear, if you would like to request an absentee ballot, there is a safe and legal process; unregulated mass mail-in ballots are illegal. Hardworking families in New York State deserve fair and legal elections.\" New York Republicans requested that the state halt the new early mail-in ballot system temporarily, which was denied by Albany County Supreme Court Justice Christina Ryba. “The Court did not consider the merits of the case and had to be forced to issue an opinion after we asked the Appellate Division to force Justice Ryba to issue an opinion,” New York Republican Chairman Ed Cox said in an [interview with ](https://nypost.com/2023/12/28/metro/gop-moves-to-block-early-mail-voting-in-george-santos-special-election/) [The New York Post.](https://nypost.com/2023/12/28/metro/gop-moves-to-block-early-mail-voting-in-george-santos-special-election/) State Republicans are expected to appeal the ruling. Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed the Early Mail Voter Act into law earlier this year. This law allows voters in New York to request a mail-in ballot up to ten days before the election. They don't have to give a reason on why they can't vote in person. \"It is shameful that we argued for a fair and legal election on October 13th only to get a ruling at 11pm on December 26th,\" Stefanik said. \"If Democrats can't win through a legal election, they cheat and that has never been more clear than right here in New York.\"",

    "text": "The voting age should be raised to 21, says Leo McKinstry (Image: Getty) Visiting a country fair near Plymouth, he witnessed a competition where around 800 participants tried to estimate the weight of an ox.\nAfter he had told the organisers about his professional interest in numbers, Galton was given permission to analyse all these guesses, which had been written on slips of paper. What he discovered was fascinating.\nAlthough most of the entries were too high or too low, the average of the 800 was remarkably accurate, missing the ox’s real weight by less than one per cent.\nTrending Galton’s test appeared to reveal that a group of citizens can have a form of collective intelligence if their opinions are pooled together.\nIt is a phenomenon known as “the wisdom of crowds”.\nOn a much bigger scale, the theory explains why the public in a free, open society usually makes the right decision at election time.\nThat undoubtedly applies to the British electorate which, throughout the last 150 years, has displayed an astonishingly intuitive and subtle instinct for reaching a result that suits the political needs of the country.\nThe collective wisdom of the British people will be required again soon, given that the next election is almost certain to be held in 2024.\nOur poll will be one of an unprecedented array of contests that will occur across the world next year, embracing nations as varied as the USA, South Africa and India, as well as the European Parliament.\nIt has been calculated that approximately 40 per cent of the globe’s population will be asked to cast their votes.\nThere are voices in Britain that express doubt about the integrity or usefulness of our own forthcoming poll.\nIn sophisticated metropolitan circles, it is fashionable to sneer that our political system is “broken”.\nBecome an Express Premium member\nSupport fearless journalism\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free\nGet super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial Some Remoaners yearn for the pre- Brexit return of quasi-imperial rule by Brussels, others want a written constitution where the lawyers would effectively be in charge.\nOne recent survey revealed that an alarming 29 per cent of young people, perhaps swayed by the authoritarianism of the woke agenda, believe that Britain should be governed by a dictatorship.\nBut unlike continental Europe, extremism has never had much appeal in Britain to mature voters, which is why both communism and fascism remained on the wild fringes of politics.\nIn fact, throughout the 1930s, Sir Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists did not win a single Parliamentary seat.\nREAD MORE Rishi Sunak’s hopes threatened by failure to address key issue, says pollster\nEven so, we cannot be complacent about the future of our democracy.\nTerrorists continue to threaten our basic freedoms.\nHostile foreign regimes seek to distort the electoral process through social media manipulation. I have my concerns.\nOne is the increasing use of postal votes, which are far more vulnerable to fraud than the traditional ballot box.\nA second is the undue media attention given to self-appointed pressure groups which fill the airwaves with their bleats about “underfunding” and their bogus statistics about mass suffering.\nREAD MORE\nTory anger as University imposes transgender name compliance policy Furious Tories have accused university bosses of “pandering to a woke edict” after ordering students to comply with transgender names and pronouns or face punishment.\nQueen’s University Belfast’s new code of conduct demands that both staff and students use whatever name and pronouns an individual demands.\nEven worse is the prospect that if Labour wins, then 16 and 17-year-olds will be given the right to vote.\nThis is not an extension of democracy, as the proposal’s supporters pretend, but a cynical, partisan move that Labour only backs because young people, devoid of real-world responsibilities and experience, are overwhelmingly left-wing.\nIt is ridiculous to assert that 16-year-olds should have a direct say in the running of our country when they are deemed too immature to get married, buy cigarettes or alcohol, take out a credit card, drive a car or use a sunbed.\nIn truth, there is a strong argument that the voting age should be raised to 21, given that today youngsters grow up much more slowly than in the past.\nBut even if Labour win, this ugly measure may flounder on the rocks of British common sense.\n“Trust the people” was one of Churchill’s guiding principles.\nThose words are just as powerful today.\nRelated articles Rishi Sunak’s hopes threatened by failure to address key issue, says pollster Emily Thornberry claims general election date is open knowledge in Parliament Bankrupt Labour councils slammed by watchdog over financial management Labour humiliated over ‘nanny state’ promises Keir Starmer's asylum plan would plunge UK immigration system into deep chaos",

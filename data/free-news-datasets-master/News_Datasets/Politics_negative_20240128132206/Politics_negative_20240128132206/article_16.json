    "text": "I swear it's like people view dystopian media as a HOW TO.\nAnd of all the people it could be from, it's from bruce schneier, a computer security guy who SHOULD know better.\nhttps://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/12/ai-and-lossy-bottlenecks.html\nRemoving democracy’s bottleneck\nThese examples are all transformative, but the lossy bottleneck that has the largest effect on society is in politics. It’s the same problem as the restaurant. As a complicated citizen, your policy positions are probably nuanced, trading off between different options and their effects. You care about some issues more than others and some implementations more than others.\nIf you had the knowledge and time, you could engage in the deliberative process and help create better laws than exist today. But you don’t. And, anyway, society can’t hold policy debates involving hundreds of millions of people. So you go to the ballot box and choose between two—or if you are lucky, four or five—individual representatives or political parties.\nImagine a system where AI removes this lossy bottleneck. Instead of trying to cram your preferences to fit into the available options, imagine conveying your political preferences in detail to an AI system that would directly advocate for specific policies on your behalf. This could revolutionize democracy.\nOne way is by enhancing voter representation. By capturing the nuances of each individual’s political preferences in a way that traditional voting systems can’t, this system could lead to policies that better reflect the desires of the electorate. For example, you could have an AI device in your pocket—your future phone, for instance—that knows your views and wishes and continually votes in your name on an otherwise overwhelming number of issues large and small.\nCombined with AI systems that personalize political education, it could encourage more people to participate in the democratic process and increase political engagement. And it could eliminate the problems stemming from elected representatives who reflect only the views of the majority that elected them—and sometimes not even them.\nOn the other hand, the privacy concerns resulting from allowing an AI such intimate access to personal data are considerable. And it’s important to avoid the pitfall of just allowing the AIs to figure out what to do: Human deliberation is crucial to a functioning democracy.\nAlso, there is no clear transition path from the representative democracies of today to these AI-enhanced direct democracies of tomorrow. And, of course, this is still science fiction.\nFirst steps\nThese technologies are likely to be used first in other, less politically charged, domains. Recommendation systems for digital media have steadily reduced their reliance on traditional intermediaries. Radio stations are like menu items: Regardless of how nuanced your taste in music is, you have to pick from a handful of options.\nThis wouldn't give people better representation, it would give those in control of the code a far more capable way of controlling who gets voted for, by sticking a software black box in between you and who you vote for!\nWorst, is that people would say \"but why have politicians, just let the AI write law.\"\nSomeone was eventually going to start saying this crap, but geeze, he should have known better.\nIf you think nobody would be retarded enough to let AI get involved in law ... https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/legal-ai-tools-essential-for-attorneys/\nOne way that AI is being used in the legal industry is by assisting with document processing and classification for a wide range of matters, including due diligence, document and contract review, compliance, contract management, knowledge management and deal analysis. By automating these tasks using intelligent technology, significant workflow benefits can be achieved, particularly with improved efficiency and productivity as well as greater accuracy.\nFor anyone that wants to do a deeper dive on one of the reasons why this is so blindingly stupid: https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web\nhttps://medium.com/analytics-matters/generative-ai-its-all-a-hallucination-6b8798445044\n(in painfully short form: ai software lies and makes stuff up. We cannot know when it has and how it has unless we already know the answers).",

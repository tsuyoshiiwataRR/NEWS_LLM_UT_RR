    "text": "Just over a week after former President Donald Trump was disqualified from Colorado’s 2024 ballot, the Michigan Supreme Court handed the former president a major win Wednesday by ruling against the Democrat’s attempt to remove Trump from the state’s 2024 presidential primary ballot. On Wednesday, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled against Free Speech For The People’s challenge to disqualify the former president from appearing on the presidential primary ballot based on claims that Trump participated in an insurrection during the Capitol Hill protest on January 6, 2021. The Michigan Supreme Court justices explained in a [brief order](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/4b0d7a/siteassets/case-documents/briefs/msc/2023-2024/166470/166470-2023-12-27-or.pdf), “The application for leave to appeal the December 14, 2023 judgment of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.” [According to](https://www.dailywire.com/news/swing-states-supreme-court-rejects-bid-to-kick-trump-off-primary-ballot) The Daily Wire, Free Speech For The People’s application was filed to challenge the decision by the Michigan Court of Appeals that allowed the Republican Party to make its own decision regarding whether Trump could appear on the presidential primary election ballot. “The Michigan Supreme Court has strongly and rightfully denied the Desperate Democrat attempt to take the leading Candidate in the 2024 Presidential Election, me, off the ballot in the Great State of Michigan,” Trump said in a celebratory [post ](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/111652954800130319)on Truth Social after the Michigan Supreme Court announced its ruling Wednesday. “This pathetic gambit to rig the Election has failed all across the Country, including in States that have historically leaned heavily toward the Democrats. Colorado is the only State to have fallen prey to the scheme.” [READ MORE: Trump handed major win by Supreme Court](https://americanmilitarynews.com/2023/12/trump-handed-major-win-by-supreme-court/) Michigan Supreme Court Justice Elizabeth Welch explained in an opinion that the Michigan Court of Appeals ruling “still allows appellants to renew their legal efforts as to the Michigan general election later in 2024 should Trump become the Republican nominee for President of the United States or seek such office as an independent candidate.” Despite the Michigan Supreme Court’s ruling on Wednesday, Free Speech For The People has indicated that it will continue to push for the removal of Trump’s name from the ballot in Michigan and in other states across the country. The liberal activist organization has launched efforts in multiple states to prevent Trump from appearing on the ballot based on claims that [Section 3 of the 14th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/section-3/) disqualifies the former president from holding office again. “The decision isn’t binding on any court outside Michigan and we continue our current and planned legal actions in other states to enforce Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment against Donald Trump,” Ron Fein, Free Speech For The People’s legal director, said in a [statement](https://freespeechforpeople.org/free-speech-for-people-statement-on-michigan-supreme-court-decision/). Additionally, Mark Brewer of Goodman Acker P.C., an election lawyer involved in the Michigan case against Trump, explained that while the Michigan Supreme Court’s decision was “disappointing,” Free Speech For The People would “seek to uphold” the 14th Amendment “at a later stage.” Brewer added, “Trump led a rebellion and insurrection against the Constitution when he tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election and he is disqualified from ever seeking or holding public office again.”",

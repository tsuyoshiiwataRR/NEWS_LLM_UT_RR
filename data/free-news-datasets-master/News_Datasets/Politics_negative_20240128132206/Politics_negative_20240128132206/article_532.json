    "text": "Lieutenant General Martin Wienen, commander of the Dutch army, stated in an interview with De Telegraaf that the homeland must be prepared for a possible military conflict with\nRussia.\nVainen believes that the Netherlands should follow the example of Finland and the Baltic states, for which preparation is something “natural” because they border\nRussia. “We should not think that our security is guaranteed just because we are 1,500 km away,” he said.\nLieutenant General’s dispute\nRussia understands “only one language – the language of strong armed forces”and the Netherlands must have “sufficient means to deter” a potential adversary.\nOn December 19, Admiral Michel Hoffmann, the chief of staff of the Belgian army, said that “Europe must urgently prepare” for a potential conflict with\nRussia. According to Hoffman, there is no direct threat to Brussels, but there is a risk to the Baltic states and Moldova.\nCzech President Petr Pavel also called\nRussia “number one threat” and stated that European armies were preparing for a possible confrontation with Moscow.\n“All armies are taking this threat seriously, all armies are preparing for the possibility of a high-intensity conflict in Europe,” the Czech leader noted.\nRussian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to Pavel’s words by stating that it is not\nRussia that threatens Europeand quite the opposite: the EU, being “a continent controlled by the United States of America”, participates in NATO, “which is moving with all its military might towards our borders”. Russia has warned Finland that it will “suffer first” in a possible conflict with NATO\nThe harsh Russian rhetoric against the Helsinki policy continues\nUS President Joe Biden believes that Vladimir Putin may attack NATO countries after “taking over Ukraine”.\n“If Putin takes over Ukraine, he won’t stop there. It is important to take a long-term view. <...> Putin will attack allies [на САЩ в НАТО]if it continues to advance, it will attack NATO allies,” Biden opined. In response, Putin said that\nRussia has “no resonance, no interest – no geopolitical, no economic, no political, no military interest” in going to war with the countries of The Alliance. Russia has warned Japan not to send air defense missiles to Ukraine\nTokyo changed its arms export laws\nIn November, the bloc’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg outlined two main tasks after the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine: the first is to support Kyivand the second – to prevent the conflict from turning into a full-fledged war between\nRussia and NATO.\n2023-12-28 20:44:40\n#Netherlands #Preparing #war #\nRussia",

Earlier this month, the China Coast Guard (CCG) once again blasted with water cannon a Philippine commissioned vessel on its way for a resupply mission.

China also continued to deny pointing a military-grade laser at a Philippine vessel in February this year. \"This is [an] entirely groundless accusation. China has no intention or necessity to use such devices,\" the spokesperson said.

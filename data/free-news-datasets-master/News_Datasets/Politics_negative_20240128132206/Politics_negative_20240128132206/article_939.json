    "text": "Former President\nDonald Trump raised eyebrows Monday (Dec. 25) when he told a handful of people who he believes are “looking to destroy our once great USA” to “rot in hell” before wishing them a “merry Christmas.”\nThe 45th President of the United States posted his statement on Truth Social, the social media platform he founded in 2021 after he was permanently suspended from Jack Dorsey’s Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. The media giants alleged that Trump was using his platform to “incite violence.”\nNearly two years later, Twitter’s new owner, Elon Musk,\nlifted Trump’s ban, allowing his more than 59,000 tweets to viewed by his now 87.4 million followers. However, although Trump’s suspension was lifted, the former president has chosen only to use Truth Social.\nRELATED:\n‘Trump Comes Up Short’—Former Trump Supporter Wayne Grudem Now Calls for Him To ‘Back Out Now’\nFacebook lifted its ban of Trump in January 2023. That page is run by the “Donald J. Trump for President” 2024 campaign staff.\nTruth Social has approximately 2 million active users, compared to Twitter, which is now called X and has over 525 million users. Facebook has 3.03 billion monthly active users.\nTrump’s Christmas message specifically mentioned President Joe Biden and special counsel Jack Smith.\n“Merry Christmas to all,” Trump wrote, “including Crooked\nJoe Biden’s\nRELATED:\nAs Trump Campaign Continues To Ramp up, So Does God-Talk\nThe GOP presidential favorite and professing Christian then mentioned world leaders, zeroing in on people he believes have set out to destroy America and wishing for them to spend an eternity in hell.\n“Included also are World Leaders,” Trump added, “both good and bad, but none of which are as evil and ‘sick’ as the THUGS we have inside our Country who, with their Open Borders, INFLATION, Afghanistan Surrender, Green New Scam, High Taxes, No Energy Independence, Woke Military, Russia/Ukraine, Israel/Iran, All Electric Car Lunacy, and so much more, are looking to destroy our once great USA.\n“\nMAY THEY ROT IN HELL,” Trump continued. “AGAIN, MERRY CHRISTMAS!”",

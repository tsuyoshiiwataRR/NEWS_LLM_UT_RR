    "text": "Still shocked by the broad content of the omnibus law that Javier Milei sent to Congress, the blocs of Deputies are dedicated to the study of the issues but they advance something: so, as it came they are not going to vote for it . The delegation of legislative powers to the Executive, the elimination of the retirement formula and the increase in withholdings are among the issues that generate the most rejection . In addition, they will call for changes on key issues, such as the authorization to take on debt and privatizations.\nThe discussion process is already generating tensions . La Libertad Avanza intends that it will only be discussed in a plenary of four commissions (Constitutional Affairs, General Legislation, Budget and Foreign Relations), but the opposition will ask for more involvement.\nThey have already sent the recommendation to the president of the Chamber, Martín Menem , who is ultimately the one who will end up deciding.\n\"The reality is that it should go to no less than 20 committees because of the number of issues involved, but if you do that, the debate never ends. But it's also true that you can't discuss education and health reform without including those commissions. Or amend the penal code without including the Justice and Criminal Affairs commission,\" said a key member of the radical bloc.\nFrom the UCR – a party that sought and continues to offer options to the ruling party to accompany the mega DNU – they are in full study, but they advance some issues that they already consider \"invokable \".\nAmong them, the delegation of legislative powers - in economic, financial, fiscal, social, social security, security, defense, tariff, energy, health and social matters - to the Executive for two years, but with the possibility of extending it until 2027, that is, throughout Milei's government.\n\"\nThe UCR has always opposed superpowers and delegating powers from Congress to the Executive . You can't legislate blindly, each proposal must guarantee improvements for retirees, workers and/or businessmen and defend minorities who should have representation in Congress,\" said the vice president of the radical bloc, Karina Banfi.\nRadical Senator Maximiliano Abad expressed himself in the same vein. \"What cannot happen, because it is not republican and puts any decision at risk, is that one of the branches absorbs powers from the others or even tries to supplant them,\" he said.\nThis issue is echoed by the rest of the opposition benches. The brand new bloc chaired by Miguel Angel Picheto, which joined with the Civic Coalition and the Cordovans of Juan Schiaretti, now has 23 legislators and will be key to the quorum. The delegation of powers put them on alert.\n\"The president was elected to improve our lives, not to build an empire,\" Margarita Stolbizer, a member of that caucus, said harshly.\nThe President entertains himself with minor matters or seeks to entertain us. It doesn't set priorities and it doesn't tell us how it will solve the main problem of the economy that crosses everyone's life: inflation. He was chosen to improve our lives, not to build an empire.\n— Margarita Stolbizer (@Stolbizer) December 28, 2023\nThe suspension of the pension formula is another point that makes noise. The legislators who were previously grouped in Juntos por el Cambio remember that this is what Alberto Fernández wanted to do and that they voted against it.\n\"The Executive's Omnibus Law project, copied from Alberto Fernández's in the 2019 emergency law, proposes the suspension of the retirement mobility formula. Enough of adjusting pensioners, Mr. President. Set pensions in UVAs, so that the elderly don't lose more,\" said Martín Tetaz.\nThe issue of withholdings is another issue that garners massive rejections. Milei himself campaigned promising to lower taxes, and when his Minister of Economy, Luis Caputo, announced that they planned to sustain and increase them, several governors – especially from the provinces of Entre Ríos, Córdoba, Buenos Aires and Santa Fe – said they were against it.\nAlthough the ruling party assures that it will be transitory, the law stipulates that the power of the Executive to lower it is transitory. \"If you don't, they will be permanent,\" they warn. The Executive's bill proposes to increase to 33% for soybeans and derivatives and 15% for wheat, corn, sunflower and the entire industry.\nIn the PRO they are still moderate. The law was divided into thematic groups to be studied and next week the bloc will meet to establish a position. \"With all the desire to accompany and support the government,\" they say close to Cristian Ritondo's leadership. Although the caucus coexists with legislators who raise objections, it is still low.\nSimilar news: Screen: what are the regulations? 3 days",

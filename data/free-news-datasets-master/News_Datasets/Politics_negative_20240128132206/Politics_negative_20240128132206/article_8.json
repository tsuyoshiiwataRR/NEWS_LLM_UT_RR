    "text": "The money was splashed on nine foreign jaunts in the 12 months to October\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has racked up a bill of more than £125,000 in a single year to jet around the globe.\nThe money was splashed on nine foreign jaunts in the 12 months to October, details of his official expenses obtained under Freedom of Information rules show.\nIt means that in just one year Sir Lindsay has gone through half the £250,000 his predecessor John Bercow took ten years to spend on globe-trotting.\nCritics today said that, for someone whose job it is to sit in a chair and largely keep quiet, taxpayers would find the bill ‘difficult to swallow’.\nAmong the more eye-catching foreign travel bills was £40,599 – including £33,400 on premium or business-class flights – for a four-day trip to Australia.\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle (pictured) has racked up a bill of more than £125,000 in a single year to jet around the globe\nIt means that in just one year Sir Lindsay has gone through half the £250,000 his predecessor John Bercow (pictured) took ten years to spend on globe-trotting\nIt was to attend the Conference of Speakers and Presiding Officers of the Commonwealth in Canberra in January with two staff.\nThe bill also included £4,702 on ‘ground transportation’ and £682 on ‘meals’.\nA five-day trip to Ottawa in Canada this summer to meet his counterpart came in at £23,571, including nearly £15,000 on flights and £8,650 on hotels.\nAnd taxpayers were billed £24,657 for a three-day jaunt to Japanese capital Tokyo for the G7 Speakers’ Conference in September, including £21,312 on flights and £3,300 on hotels.\nA trip to the G20 Parliamentary Speakers’ Summit in Jakarta, Indonesia, in November 2022 followed by a visit to Sir Lindsay’s counterpart in Singapore came with a price tag of nearly £25,000.\nThis included nearly £19,000 on flights, £5,190 on accommodation and £410 for a photographer.\nThousands of pounds was also spent on an ‘official visit’ to the Caribbean island of Montserrat, a British Overseas Territory, and giving a speech at the University of Southern California.\nWhile flights and hotels for the latter trip were covered by the university, it is unclear if the £3,169 bill for ‘ground transportation’ was. Sir Lindsay also flew to Gibraltar and Dublin in the 12-month period.\nSir Lindsay took a five-day trip to Ottawa in Canada this summer to meet his counterpart Anthony Rota (pictured) came in at £23,571\nSeparately, he spent £101,552 – including £47,962 on flights – sponsoring a ‘Speakers of the UK House of Commons and Overseas Territories’ conference on the paradise Caribbean island of Anguilla.\nHe attended the three-day conference, which made £12,000 income from ‘conference observer’ fees, with two staff.\nDuring the period, Sir Lindsay also accepted £1,000-worth of hospitality and tickets from Formula One for the Silverstone Grand Prix, £600-worth of hospitality from the Concours d’Elegance automotive display at Hampton Court Palace and £1,717-worth of hospitality from The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo.\nHe racked up taxi bills of £621 this year and £995 last year, according to the data released after FOI request by the Mail.\nSir Lindsay, who is the MP for Chorley and is entitled to a £163,000-a-year salary, has also spent tens of thousands of pounds laying on drinks and canapés receptions over the last year.\nThese include £4,100 on a reception to mark ‘LGBT History Month’ and £3,500 on a retirement party for former Clerk of the House Sir John Benger.\nIt comes after it emerged in October that taxpayers have been billed £7million to refurbish the grace-and-favour Speaker’s House since Sir Lindsay came into office.\nThe sum has been spent on renovations of the Grade-I listed building, located in the New Palace of Westminster, since November 2019.\nSir Lindsay also accepted £1,000-worth of hospitality and tickets from Formula One for the Silverstone Grand Prix (pictured)\nWith more than £1 million spent per year on the works since the Speaker took office, the bill appears to dwarf those of previous refurbishments.\nIt is unknown exactly how much of the money was spent on furnishings and how much went towards structural improvements.\nJohn O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will find these enormous expenses difficult to swallow.\n‘The Speaker’s role is a significant one, and cannot necessarily be done on the cheap, but that doesn’t give anyone in the role a blank cheque.\n‘All politicians should remember that each penny spent fulfilling their duties is ultimately billed to taxpayers, including their own constituents.’\nSir Lindsay was installed as Speaker in November 2019 but has done the vast majority of foreign travel within the last 12 months or so due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nHis predecessor Mr Bercow came under fire for some of his spending during his ten-year tenure chairing Commons debates.\nHe flew almost 207,000 miles and his globe-trotting cost £250,000. His most expensive trip was to Burma and New Zealand in July 2013, costing £41,000 for him, three staff members and three MPs.\nA House of Commons spokesman said: ‘The Speaker is a representative for the House of Commons and has a responsibility to explain and promote the work of the House, representing it at high-profile state events and inter-parliamentary conferences – both across the Commonwealth and around the world.\n‘To meet these responsibilities, transport arrangements are made by the Speaker’s Office, with value for money and security the primary considerations.’",

    "text": "Dakota Adams used to believe in the impending apocalypse. But when the repeated promises of societal meltdown failed to materialize, despite continued, urgent assertions otherwise by notorious militia leader Stewart Rhodes, Adams began to see his father for who he really was. Much has changed since then, and the world still turns. In November, Adams declared his candidacy as a Democrat for a seat in the House of the Montana Legislature. It's the 26-year-old's first bid for office after publicly denouncing his father as an abusive force he, his siblings and mother fled in 2018. Adams' story has been told internationally through outlets like [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63709446). He wrote a 10,000-word essay published last year on the progressive news site Raw Story titled \" [How I left the far right](https://www.rawstory.com/dakota-rhodes/).\" People are also reading… Tasha Adams: “I still sometimes feel like I released him out into the world. I think of him like a grenade where I was always putting the pin back in.\" In part, Adams is running to ensure a deeply red district doesn’t go uncontested as it has two of the last three election cycles. Adams is also running because as a former Trump supporter, he wants his criticisms of the GOP for kowtowing to Trump, who has in turn kowtowed to anti-government extremists like his father, to be more than talk. \"I believe that every election should be contested by default, because people deserve to have a fair hearing of issues, to know what their candidates believe and to hear debate on solutions,\" Adams said in a recent phone interview. \"So as an advocate for people doing that, I have to walk the walk and do it myself or it’s just me yelling at people on Twitter.\" Adams lives outside of Eureka and will run in the newly redrawn House District 1, which covers northwest Montana from Troy to Eureka. He works in construction while going to Flathead Valley Community College part-time and serves as a rural volunteer firefighter at the Trego-Fortine-Stryker fire service area south of town. Democrats have continued to lose out in rural areas in recent years, falling into a super-minority at the state Legislature. They hold particularly little ground in northwest Montana. Adams believes the party has left too many elections on the table without a challenge in the region, but he also credited recruitment efforts like his father used to engineer for a snowballing migration of \"hardcore conservatives\" into regions like northwest Montana. 'Began to see cracks' The story of his family’s escape from Rhodes has also been told in the [local news](https://flatheadbeacon.com/2022/09/28/broken-oaths/), where communities are familiar with the presence of militia movements in northwest Montana. In its prosecution of Elmer Stewart Rhodes III, the U.S. Department of Justice described the Oath Keepers as a \"large but loosely organized collection of individuals, some of whom are associated with militias.\" Adams grew up in that world, pushed into tactical training exercises and ideological bubbles. But eventually he and others came to realize Rhodes' game of making profits and egotistical gains depended on sustaining the global conspiracies that animated the organization's membership. Years later at trial for his actions around Jan. 6, 2021, prosecutors raised examples that showed Rhodes using Oath Keepers funds for personal expenses. \"I began to see cracks because I became aware that Stewart, my father, was very much a fraud and was not running Oath Keepers in a way that signaled that he believed truly in Oath Keepers being a last bastion against the death of America,\" Adams said. \"He was using it as a platform to pursue his own self-aggrandizement, to follow a pathological need to be a great figure in American history.\" The Jan. 6 riots and the response from some Republicans to carry on with Trump's false stolen election claims made Adams re-evaluate his politics even further. Rhodes, meanwhile, was convicted after an eight-week trial for seditious conspiracy in plotting to upset the presidential transfer of power. In May he was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The turnabout for Adams has swept him entirely across the political spectrum, from a \"hardcore Trump supporter\" who believed in [the Pizzagate conspiracy](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/26/521545788/conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones-apologizes-for-promoting-pizzagate) to identifying today as a Democratic socialist. He remains in support of the Second Amendment, although he said it’s a more nuanced stance than when he was a part of the militia movement. \"I no longer see anti-gun people as a tentacle of a sinister, global conspiracy,\" Adams said. \"And I also can no longer consider gun rights to be the predominant single issue in the election.\" Creating ripples Before Jan. 6, militia groups picked up steam in response to government lockdown measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Domestic extremism experts have [warned](https://abcnews.go.com/US/domestic-extremism-changed-2-years-after-jan-6/story?id=96242077) about another uptick in activity during the 2024 presidential election. Asked about how voters in northwest Montana will receive his rejection of Rhodes and the militia movement, Adams said his past may actually provide some common ground. \"One big piece of the puzzle here is that Stewart burned all of his bridges in this area with the militia movement by being so personally toxic that he made himself a pariah in this corner of the state,\" he said. \"I feel like leveraging my life story so not be dismissed out of hand for having the wrong team color is going to be really useful for talking to people, and talking with people about what is important to them.\" This right here is one proud Mamma…— Ryan Busse (@ryandbusse) [@That_Girl_Tasha] filming her son Dakota who is running for state legislature in Montana. These two serve as inspiration to our entire country. Tasha was married to cheif Oath Keeper Stewart Rhodes, Dakota his son…and here they are [pic.twitter.com/Vnbevlzt6Y] [December 20, 2023] One of Adams’ early supporters is Scott Ernest, a self-described de-radicalization consultant. Since [exiting](https://www.tampabay.com/narratives/2021/01/23/former-florida-white-nationalist-reckons-with-his-past-americas-present/) the white nationalist Pioneer Little Europe community in the nearby Flathead Valley, Ernest developed a network to try giving people an off-ramp from extremist groups. The two connected on social media around the time Adams was growing more vocal about his past. Ernest said that campaigns like Adams’ can create ripples through militia groups and the broader community as an example of someone who can flip the script on their life from inside a cult-like environment. \"I think he has one thing that his dad actually had, which is charisma,\" Ernest said. \"Unlike his dad, though, he has critical thinking skills, common sense, other things his dad lacks. It’s good to see the kid of Stewart Rhodes doing something that obviously can be construed as pro-government, running for office.\" If elected, Adams said he wants to focus on the independence of the state Supreme Court, address rising property taxes that are riling communities across the state and push back on the Legislature’s anti-transgender legislation. The latter largely defined the final weeks of the 2023 Legislature when Democratic Rep. Zooey Zephyr of Missoula, one of the first transgender lawmakers in Montana history, was voted off the House floor. That episode took off during the debate over Senate Bill 99, a ban on gender-affirming care for trans youth uniformly opposed by Democrats. Republicans took a hard stance against Zephyr's comments during that debate and voted to ban her from the House floor when she refused to apologize. \"The rationale (of the bill) was protecting children from life-altering surgery, which I can see how people would have very strong opinions on that they have come to honestly,\" Adams said of Senate Bill 99. \"But in the state of Montana I can find no rule preventing a pageant mom from badgering her 13-year-old into getting a boob job.\" 2024 race Adams’ presumptive opponent next year will be three-term incumbent Republican Rep. Neil Duram, who was elected in 2018 and 2022 without a general election opponent. In 2020 Duram won a contested race with 80% of the vote over his Democratic challenger. No other candidates have declared for the seat. The filing period opens in January and closes mid-March. While usually voting for the cultural agenda Republicans passed through the session, the bills Duram introduced during that 2023 Legislature strayed very little into fringe politics. One bill sought to create an \"election security team\" appointed by various government officials to oversee hand- counting of each voting precinct was done within a year of an election. A former Montana Highway Patrol trooper of 28 years and current chief of police in Eureka, legislation Duram introduced in 2023 focused mostly on traffic and driving laws. While social issues may ignite headlines and phone calls, Duram said voters in his district have been most vocal about rising residential property taxes. Asked for this story, however, if he perceives militia groups to be a visible constituency in his area, Duram responded, \"I’m not a member of any specific militia group but my position is that every citizen of this country is a member of the militia.\" Said another way, Duram doesn’t view militias as necessarily extremist. He suggested someone speaking up to avert a shoplifting underway could fit Duram’s definition of what a militia response can look like. Duram has also been on the receiving end of extremism from across the political divide. For weeks after the session, Duram said he received calls and phone messages attacking his support for the anti-trans legislation. That response escalated in June, when Duram and three other Montana GOP lawmakers [received suspicious packages](https://helenair.com/news/local/government-politics/2-montana-republicans-legislators-receive-suspicious-powder-in-mail/article_23e7db02-1238-11ee-a82f-a7cc88e2580e.html) containing an unknown white powder. Duram’s letter was postmarked from Kansas City; Republican legislators in [many states](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/24/us/white-powder-montana-legislators/index.html#:~:text=Montana%20legislators%20are%20the%20latest,mail%20containing%20a%20white%20powder.) received similar letters in June. The Yellowstone County Sheriff’s Office tested the powder sent to another legislator and determined it was flour. \"I think there was an extremist out there that had more time than the rest of us,\" Duram said. Last week, Adams appeared at three campaign events in a single day in Lincoln County with Ryan Busse, Democratic candidate for governor whose profile has also grown in recent years. That rise followed Busse turning away from his former life as a gun sales executive, as he wrote in his 2021 memoir \"Gunfight: My Battle Against the Industry that Radicalized America”. Busse opens that book in a scene with his family at a Black Lives Matter rally in 2020 in Kalispell, about an hour south of Adams’ home, standing opposite several armed counter protesters, some of whom wore Oath Keepers patches on their outfits. Adams said he was at that rally, as well. \"The guy wants to be able to have a free, rational thought and that’s how I felt about much of the way things are in the firearms industry,\" Busse said in an interview this week. \"We don't have to approve of Three Percenters and Boogaloo Boys. That's a low bar. … (But) I think people don't realize how incredibly hard it is to pull yourself from a totalitarian organization and extremist organization like Dakota was in, and how brave that is.\" This article has been updated to correct a misquote attributed to Adams.",

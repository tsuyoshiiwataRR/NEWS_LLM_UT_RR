    "text": "From Charles Town:\nI cannot understand how anyone seeing the abomination, which has destroyed the rural character and serenity of the area on Route 115 and the Kabletown Road with a solar farm that will not even deliver power to this area, believes it would be a good idea to build more of the same. It has so far created a hazardous traffic situation, mud and debris on the road and great clouds of dust - an industrial area in a rural setting.\nFrom Hedgesville:\nAnyone else tired of Biden telling everyone how great the economy is, and we just don't see it.\nFrom Charles Town:\nWatching Major Media's 2023 in review was entertaining. Most of it, they got right. Some was almost right, and some were totally misrepresented. The George Floyd spot was wrong. The media never publicized the official autopsy of Floyd, which led to \"mostly peaceful\" riots and ramped up the war on police. The Trump Saga. He's never been tried, nor convicted for insurrection. He never committed it. Political theater to misdirect from the debacles, and crimes, of Biden Crime Family.\nFrom Martinsburg:\nCan someone please run for mayor and actually promote this city like Harriet did? She covered parking meters at the holiday season to encourage shoppers downtown, something that hasn’t been done since her passing. She put a spotlight on small businesses in our city, which hasn’t been done since her passing. We need someone to step up and take pride and will put in the work to clean up the trash and promote our city, not sit behind a desk.\nFrom Hedgesville:\nThe talking point that Biden is producing more oil than under Trump is misleading. It uses a four-year average that takes advantage of the precipitous oil use drop under COVID-19. Prior to Covid, close to 13 million barrels a day were being produced during Trump's administration - another Biden abuse of statistics to fool the underinformed.\nFrom Berkeley Springs:\nCharles Town claims that illegal immigrants who travel to the U.S. get a blanket and $35K in benefits. I wonder how many hundreds of thousands of dollars in benefits Charles Town has received, and all he did was travel through his mother's birth canal, and she was the one who did all the work.",

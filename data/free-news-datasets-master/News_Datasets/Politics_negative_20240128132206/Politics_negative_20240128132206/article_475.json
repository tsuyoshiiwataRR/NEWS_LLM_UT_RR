    "text": "Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin commissioned a study in 2021 following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, in which several active duty military and veterans participated, to gain better insight into the breadth of the problem,\naccording to a memo.\nHowever, the study, based on interviews with more than 100 defense officials and experts, government studies, articles, and preexisting data, was completed in mid-2022, and found something he didn’t expect. It\nfound that DOD, despite two years of work, has failed to understand domestic extremism and may have inflated the issue to the possible detriment of cohesion within the ranks.\n“May have?”\nAs if we didn’t know, it\ndamages the cohesiveness of the soldiers.\n“In the absence of a clear and consistent message, there is a risk that misinterpretations could lead to a significant division in the force along political and ideological lines, with some members of the military believing that they are being targeted for their views” the authors\n wrote.\nThey “found reason to believe that the risk to the military from widespread polarization and division in the ranks may be a greater risk than the radicalization of a few service members.”\nAustin said they’ll follow the recommendations but added: “The vast majority of those who serve in uniform and their civilian colleagues do so with great honor and integrity, but any extremist behavior in the force can have an outsized impact. We shall adhere to our core beliefs and values and reaffirm the oaths we each took to uphold and support the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. This is the greatest fighting force the world has known, and we will ensure it remains exactly that.”\nWHITE RAGE AND PRONOUNS\nIn other words, nothing has changed really. The soldiers will still have to watch their pronouns or be pegged as extremists. Austin will still talk about imaginary “white rage,” and normal white males will be targeted as potential domestic terrorists.\n-\n[The Importance of Prayer: How a Christian Gold Company Stands Out by Defending Americans’ Retirement]( https://www.independentsentinel.com/the-importance-of-prayer-how-a-christian-gold-company-stands-out-by-defending-americans-retirement//)\nThe military has to undergo\n mandatory pronoun training, which is insane. Austin is also foisting full CRT training on them.\nAustin targeted Trump supporters as domestic terrorists, continually referring to J6. He also spent time and tax money renaming bases and taking down at least one historical statue.",

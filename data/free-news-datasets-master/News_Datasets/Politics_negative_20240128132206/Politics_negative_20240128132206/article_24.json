    "text": "Colorado decision was early Christmas present for Trump\nThe Colorado Supreme Court ruled that former President Donald Trump cannot be on the Colorado primary ballot. It’s their opinion he is disqualified because of the insurrection clause in the Constitution -- though Trump has never been charged with insurrection.\nTrump’s numbers have continued to rise in the polls with each accusation by the Democrats. It’s one thing when numerous lawsuits are filed against Trump that do not affect voters directly; it’s another thing when a court attempts to keep a candidate off the ballot, especially the leading candidate in a presidential primary.\nIn the U.S.A., people vote and Trump will be thanking the Colorado court when, in my opinion, his poll numbers will soar because of the early Christmas gift Trump did not expect.\nBECKY SMITH , ROSWELL\nPrimary purpose of college is education, not entertainment\nPerhaps 30 years ago, I saw news about a professor at UGA complaining that her football-playing students were being given unmerited advantages over other students. Their college participation was more highly credited for athletics than for academics. State taxpayers were required to subsidize people bringing reduced economic advantages to the state through overall employment scenarios.\nAn AJC Dec. 18 article told statistics of former UGA football players having far lower graduation rates than most other NCAA Division 1 (athletics) universities.\nWhile sports generate entertainment for many people, the relative value to the majority of Georgians paying taxes to subsidize college sports is too low as contrasted with the numbers of economic and other life functions supported by academic achievements and improved employment for far higher numbers of Georgians.\nRequired taxes are extortion if applied to things unhelpful to more Georgians. Taxes fund public colleges. Colleges’ primary purpose is higher education, not entertainment.\nTOM STREETS , ATLANTA",

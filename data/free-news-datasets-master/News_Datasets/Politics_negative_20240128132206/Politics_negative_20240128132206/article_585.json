    "text": "Labor has said the Tories are “writing off” young people, with the number of young people out of work due to “long-term illness” doubling since 2010.\nSir Keir Starmer's party said that in 2010/11, 116,000 young people aged 16 to 24 were out of work or were not looking for employment due to long-term illness.\nThe party said the number of people unemployed now stands at 235,000, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the whole of Britain.\nShadow Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said: “By ignoring the essential foundations for a healthy economy, the Tories are writing off hundreds of thousands of young people.”\nThe Labor MP said his party would ensure young people do not fall through the cracks between services and government departments.\nShe hopes that improving mental health services, as well as reducing NHS waiting lists and strengthening workers' rights, will help tackle the “root causes” of economic inactivity.\nMs Kendall said: “Labour will tackle the root causes of economic inactivity, including the mental health crisis faced by many of our young people.\n“We will transform mental health services, reduce NHS waiting lists, boost skills, strengthen employment rights and provide tailored job support.”\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt and Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride have both called for getting people of all ages back into the workplace to boost labor supply across the UK.\nThe proportion of people out of work has increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, but the problem is also seen to be driven by wider factors, including rising levels of disability and long-term illness.\nA government spokesperson said: “We are reducing inactivity and helping young people into work as we build on our track record of reducing youth unemployment by 43% since 2010.\n“We are investing £2.3 billion in mental health services and supporting more 16 and 17-year-olds to take part in education and apprenticeships.\n“More broadly our Back to Work scheme will help people with long-term health conditions, disabilities or who are long-term unemployed to get into and stay in work.”\nA Conservative spokesman accused Labor of having a “brass neck”, saying that the party had “never left office with lower unemployment than it inherited”.\nSource: uk.finance.yahoo.com",

    "text": "Agencies\nGaza\nIsraeli forces bombarded cities, towns and refugee camps across Gaza on Thursday, killing dozens of people.\nThe Palestine News and Information Agency (WAFA) Quote: d field sources as saying that 10 people were martyred and 12 were injured in a bombing that targeted a house near Al Amal Hospital in Khan Younis, south of the Gaza Strip.\nAnother 17 people were martyred as a result of Israeli raids that targeted homes in the central Gaza Strip and two journalists were martyred in an Israeli bombing that targeted their family homes in the Beit Lahia project in the northern Gaza Strip.\nLater, more than 30 Palestinians were martyred in the occupation’s bombing of a residential square in the Beit Lahia project. The occupation aircraft also bombed two family homes in the central Gaza Strip, resulting in at least seven martyrs and dozens of wounded.\nBassel Kheir al-Din, a journalist with a local TV station, said the strike flattened his family house and severely damaged three neighboring homes. He said 12 members of his family — including three children ages 2, 7 and 8 — were buried and presumed dead, and that nine neighbors were missing.\nIn central Gaza, Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the built-up Bureij and Nuseirat refugee camps, leveling buildings, residents said. page 3\n Copy 29/12/2023 10",

    "text": "Former NCAA swimming champion turned women’s sports activist Riley Gaines is urging the Republican Gov. of Ohio, Mike DeWine, to sign a bill into law that would ban transgender surgeries for children.\n“Governor DeWine of Ohio has had the SAFE Act (protects women’s sports & child mutilation) on his desk to sign into effect since the 15th,” Gaines wrote Wednesday.\n“He hasn’t signed it yet. He has two more days to sign before it becomes law without his signature. Why the hesitation, @GovMikeDeWine?”\nGovernor DeWine of Ohio has had the SAFE Act (protects women's sports & child mutilation) on his desk to sign into effect since the 15th.\nHe hasn't signed it yet. He has 2 more days to sign before it becomes law without his signature.\nWhy the hesitation, @GovMikeDeWine ? pic.twitter.com/54SVn6y4Nb\n— Riley Gaines (@Riley_Gaines_) December 27, 2023\nDeWine seems to be avoiding talking much about this bill. Still, right after the state legislature passed it and sent it to his desk to sign, he said that the issue was “contentious.” He added, “Other states have dealt with this issue as well, but ultimately, my decision will be based on one thing – and that is what I think is in the best interest of the children that will be impacted by this law.”\nRepublican Gubernatorial-elect Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine gives his victory speech after winning the Ohio gubernatorial race at the Ohio Republican Party’s election night party at the Sheraton Capitol Square on November 6, 2018 in Columbus, Ohio. (Justin Merriman/Getty Images)\nEven if he doesn’t sign it, the Save Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act ( HB 444 ) automatically becomes law by Saturday.\nWhether he signs it or not is immaterial to the law, but if he does not, that is a statement in and of itself.\nThe law would stop doctors and hospitals from prescribing so-called “gender-affirming” drugs and would ban radical sex reassignment surgeries on minors. Another portion of the bill prevents male-born transgender athletes from participating in women’s and girl’s sports in the state.\nTo date, 22 states have some level of prohibition on transition-related treatments for minors. Many are being challenged in court.\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston , or Truth Social @WarnerToddHuston\nPolitics Sports Mike DeWine Riley Gaines SAFE Act Transgender Transgender Athletes",

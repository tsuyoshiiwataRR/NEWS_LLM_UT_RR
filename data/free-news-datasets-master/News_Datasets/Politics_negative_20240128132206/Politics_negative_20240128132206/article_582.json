Sure, [he once told a 7-year-old boy](/story/news/politics/2018/12/24/donald-trump-tells-child-its-marginal-still-believe-santa-clause/2410738002/) that believing in Santa is “marginal.” But the former president insists he was nothing but gracious on the set of [“Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,”](/story/entertainment/movies/2023/12/22/home-alone-movies-ranked/72012545007/) after the film’s director claimed that Trump forced his way into a cameo. On Wednesday, Trump addressed his blink-and-you'll-miss-it role in the 1992 comedy [in a lengthy post on Truth Social](https://twitter.com/DrewSav/status/1740121012455272756), his social-media platform. “Director Chris Columbus, and others, were begging me to make a cameo appearance in ‘Home Alone 2,’ ” Trump wrote. “They rented the Plaza Hotel in New York, which I owned at the time. I was very busy, and didn’t want to do it. They were very nice, but above all, persistent. I agreed, and the rest is history! “That little cameo took off like a rocket and the movie was a big success, and still is, especially around Christmastime,” he added. “People call me whenever it is aired.” Columbus recently told [Business Insider](https://www.insider.com/home-alone-30-anniversary-chris-columbus-trump-cameo-2020-11) that in addition to a standard shooting fee, Trump would only let them use the Plaza if he could make a cameo. “He did bully his way into the movie,” Columbus said. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” Trump wrote. “That cameo helped make the movie a success, but if they felt bullied, or didn’t want me, why did they put me in, and keep me there, for over 30 years? Because I was, and still am, great for the movie, that’s why! Just another Hollywood guy from the past looking for a quick fix of Trump publicity for himself!” “Home Alone 2” made a whopping $359 million [at the worldwide box office](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0104431/). It’s impossible to ever truly know how much of that was fueled by Trump’s six-second, one-line cameo.

    "text": "Press Release Federal Grand Jury Indicts Louisville Felon for Illegally Possessing Firearms Thursday, December 28, 2023 Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Digg Reddit Pinterest Email For Immediate Release U.S. Attorney's Office, Western District of Kentucky Louisville, KY â€“ A federal grand jury in Louisville returned an indictment on November 21, 2023, charging a local man with 2 counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\nU.S. Attorney Michael A. Bennett of the Western District of Kentucky, Special Agent in Charge Rana Saoud of the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Nashville, and Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel of the Louisville Metro Police Department made the announcement.\nAccording to the indictment, on June 3,2023, Daiquan Walker, 28, possessed a Springfield, Model XD-9, 9-millimeter caliber pistol and ammunition, and on October 19, 2023, he possessed a Glock, Model 19GEN5, 9-millimeter pistol, an Anderson, Model AM-15, multi-caliber pistol, and ammunition. Walker was prohibited from possessing a firearm because he had previously been convicted of the following felony offenses:\nOn January 3, 2017, in Jefferson Circuit Court, Walker was convicted of robbery in the second degree (2 counts), tampering with physical evidence, and criminal mischief in the first degree.\nOn December 27, 2023, Walker made an initial court appearance before a U.S. Magistrate Judge in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. Walker remains detained pending trial. If convicted, Walker faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors.\nThere is no parole in the federal system.\nThis case is being investigated by HSI and LMPD with the assistance ATF.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Alicia P. Gomez is prosecuting this case.\nThis case is part of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a program bringing together all levels of law enforcement and the communities they serve to reduce violent crime and gun violence, and to make our neighborhoods safer for everyone. On May 26, 2021, the Department launched a violent crime reduction strategy strengthening PSN based on these core principles: fostering trust and legitimacy in our communities, supporting community-based organizations that help prevent violence from occurring in the first place, setting focused and strategic enforcement priorities, and measuring the results.\nAn indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n###\nUpdated December 28, 2023",

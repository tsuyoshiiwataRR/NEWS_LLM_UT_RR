    "text": "The decision by the Minister for Health to commemorate the departure of the retiring Permanent Secretary for Health, Dr James Fong, by having a big farewell party for him on 26th January in Labasa, at the Ministry’s cost, is frankly outrageous. International Womens Association (Fiji) President, Judy Compain has highlighted this in a facebook post where she has also tagged Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka and Deputy Prime Minister Professor Biman Prasad. Compain says at a time when hospitals in Fiji are desperately in need of financial resources to address failed and demised infrastructure and to provide better medical and support services to the people of Fiji, the Health Minister’s irresponsible decision is a slap in the face of Fiji citizens who are demanding better health services. She says the Minister allegedly sent a written directive for each unit, to send staff, and that all airfares and accommodation are to be paid for from the health budget. The IWF President says the use of Fiji taxpayers’ money to conduct a big party in the North, coincidentally in the Minister’s home province, will be viewed by many as a blatant misuse of our already beleaguered national health budget. She says to be frank, the Minister for Health should know better. Compain says she cannot believe that the outgoing Dr Fong who is a good man and who she has had a great working relationship with, would approve of this act by the Minister. She says she is calling on Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Professor Biman Prasad to stop this event from happening and to use taxpayers' money wisely to build better medical infrastructure, and to clean up and resource the hospitals of Fiji. The IWF President says if the Minister wants to thank Dr Fong, a wiser and more prudent use of resources is to host a small party in Suva, at the Minister’s private expense or have staff pay for themselves, and have those outside Suva attend by Zoom to say a few words. She asks could this farewell not have been done during the 100 year celebrations held last week when most medical staff were in attendance. Compain adds the government needs to curb its expenditure on unnecessary things. We are currently trying to speak to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance.

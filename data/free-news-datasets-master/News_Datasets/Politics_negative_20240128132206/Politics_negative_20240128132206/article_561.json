    "text": "Lawyers seek police probe of Post Office executives (Image: Getty) Lawyers representing victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal say there is “more than enough evidence” for police to investigate senior staff members accused of covering it up.\nBetween 1999 and 2015, some 736 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted using data from an IT system.\nSome went to prison for false accounting and theft, many were financially ruined and shunned.\nBut in 2019, the High Court ruled the Horizon software contained “bugs, errors and defects” and there was a “material risk” it had caused shortfalls in Post Office branch accounts.\nTrending Some 93 convictions have now been overturned. Some of those affected have died, including by suicide, before receiving compensation payouts that have so far totalled £138million.\nSome of the accused postmasters have since claimed that senior staff at the Post Office either wilfully covered up dozens of bugs or “deliberately shut their eyes to the obvious”.\nAn independent public inquiry into the scandal was established in September 2020 chaired by Sir Wyn Williams.\nEmails have shown that senior staff demanded the Post Office “grit its teeth and get on with prosecuting”.\nInvestigators’ bonuses were dependent on how much cash they recovered under the Proceeds of Crime Act.\nNow Paul Marshall, a barrister who has represented postmasters, claims: “There is more than enough evidence for the police to open criminal investigations into several senior Post Office staff.”\nEd Henry KC told the inquiry: “Evidence has begun to reveal a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.”\nThe Post Office said: “We’re aware of the human cost of the scandal and we’re doing all we can to right the wrongs.”\nBecome an Express Premium member Support fearless journalism Read The Daily Express online, advert free Get super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial\nLast week the government announced that £138m has so far been paid out to over 2,700 claimants across the three Post Office compensation schemes.\nSo far, 93 convictions have been overturned and the first 27 claims have agreed full and final settlements.\nAll 2,417 postmasters who have claimed through the original Horizon Shortfall Scheme have had offers of compensation.\nMinister for Postal Affairs Kevin Hollinrake said: “It is important that everyone knows the truth about what happened, and that steps are being taken to right the wrongs of the past.\"\nTruth and accountability are one part of providing justice, and the other part is compensation.”\nRelated articles Moment man threatens to ‘kill’ Orthodox Jews as Hanukkah item destroyed Horror as boy, 4, knifed to death in home as mum charged with murder Flat explodes leaving giant hole in wall as woman rushed to hospital Met accused of 'gaslighting' after saying protests didn't shut Oxford Street Christmas tragedy as mum and two dogs killed in 'hit and run' with man arrested",

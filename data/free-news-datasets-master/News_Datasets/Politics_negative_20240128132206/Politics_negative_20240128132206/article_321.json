    "text": "Summary by Ground News Kevin Hart is suing his former assistant and a YouTuber, who allegedly demanded a six-figure payout not to publish what the actor claims is a defamatory interview. Tasha K, whose real name is Latasha Kebe, has over a million subscribers on her YouTube channel, where she mostly posts about celebrity gossip. In the suit, Hart claims that an unidentified affiliate of Kebe reached out to him in November stating that an interview would be published unless he paid a $250,000 ransom.

    "text": "Rational policymakers know something must be done to curb gun violence, especially the epidemic of mass shootings. But too many fear the political consequences of taking on the NRA and the gun manufacturers. Oklahomans were reminded of that reality earlier this month when Sen. Jessica Garvin, R-Duncan, introduced legislation for the 2024 session in response to last fall’s shooting death of a 16-year-old at a Choctaw High School football game. Garvin’s proposed Senate Bill 1254 would increase to a felony the unlawful possession of a gun on school property, punishable by a maximum $2,500 fine and one year in jail. “While it’s already illegal to carry a firearm on school grounds,” she said in a news release, “we determined the current state punishment is nothing more than a slap on the wrist.” Except, of course, the Choctaw tragedy involved teenagers whose brains aren’t yet fully formed (the alleged shooter was only 15). Anyone really believe teenagers are going to calculate the felonious consequences of packing heat? Reality screams otherwise. The real problem is too much access to too many guns, especially to firearms that can mow down dozens in the equivalent of a nanosecond. These are not the muskets of the era when the Second Amendment was crafted. Garvin’s proposal would do next-to-nothing to end the carnage, but it provides political cover when constituents demand to know what she’s doing to help ensure their safety in public spaces. What could help create serious dialogue about sensible gun control? Hitting gun manufacturers where it hurts – in their pocketbooks. A group of activist nuns recently showed the way in a Nevada court, filing a lawsuit aimed at pressuring Smith & Wesson to change the way it manufactures and markets its version of the AR-15 rifle. The nuns alleged company leaders are putting shareholders at risk, contending its marketing played “a significant role in contributing to many of the most heinous crimes in United States history.” Specifically, they cite ads that mimic video games “appealing to young, and predominantly male consumers of such games.” Legal experts disagree on the lawsuit’s viability, but it may be the only way to get gun manufacturers and their proxies in D.C. and in statehouses to negotiate sensible restrictions. How about Congress revive the federal assault weapons ban? Or Oklahoma lawmakers enact Red Flag laws aimed at helping frantic families and law enforcement get firearms out of the hands – at least temporarily – of troubled individuals who might harm themselves or others? Alas, Oklahoma appears nowhere near having such discussions – Garvin’s proposal notwithstanding. Remember, it was just three years ago that Oklahoma became the first state to enact an anti-Red Flag law. And Garvin’s SB 1254 quickly drew the ire of the Oklahoma 2nd Amendment Association’s president, Don Spencer, who declared, “This attack on our rights must be stopped.” When it comes to guns, unfortunately, many in the Republican-dominated Legislature take their marching orders from Spencer – and from zealots who wield disproportionate influence in GOP primaries and live in perpetual fear the feds are coming for their firearms. To her credit, Garvin earlier this year helped derail a proposal that would have required the state sever ties with firms discriminating against firearms and ammunition manufacturers. But like most Republican lawmakers, she still treads carefully around gun rights. “I’m pro-Second Amendment and have voted continuously to uphold this right for Oklahomans,” she insisted. “I’m also in strong favor of protecting the lives of children and others on our school campuses. This bill is about stopping this illegal activity and giving prosecutors the power to pursue more significant charges.” Stay tuned. – Arnold Hamilton is editor of The Oklahoma Observer; okobserver.org",

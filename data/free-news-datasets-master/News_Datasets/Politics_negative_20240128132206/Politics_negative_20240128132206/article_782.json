    "text": "Margao: Following protests by locals against the erection of a high tension line tower inside the Xeldem lake, the authorities have decided to halt the ongoing work. They have also decided to shift the tower outside the lake area. The tower is part of the Tamnar power transmission project.Senior power department officials, Tamnar project representatives, panchayat and zilla panchayat members, and others, along with Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral conducted a joint inspection of the site on Thursday before taking the decision.Locals expressed fears about the adverse effects of the high tension line tower on the fragile ecosystem of the lake. “The Xeldem lake is more than just a geographic landmark; it stands as an embodiment of the community’s shared history, culture, and environmental stewardship,” they said.Activist Aditya Dessai who had complained to the authorities against illegal landfilling of the lake said, “After six months of struggle, we have got assurance from the local administration that the tower will be shifted outside the lake boundaries. Villagers have decided to wait for one more day to see that the construction work is stopped.”Prashant Gauns Dessai, who was on a sit-in protest at the site for the last few days, said he has withdrawn the protest following the assurance, but “if the construction work continues, we will resume the agitation”.Gauns Dessai said that the Xeldem lake, besides being a biodiversity hotspot, has been the lifeline of the village. “The Xeldem lake water has irrigated our fields and provided drinking water for the locals long before the Selaulim dam water reached our village,” he said.Cabral unequivocally told the Tamnar representatives that he won’t allow the tower to be erected in the lake. “Besides the lake being a notified wetland, the issue concerns sentiments of the locals. The people are not against development, but only want the tower shifted away from the lake. The construction work inside the lake needs to be stopped immediately and the workforce removed from there,” he told the officials.",

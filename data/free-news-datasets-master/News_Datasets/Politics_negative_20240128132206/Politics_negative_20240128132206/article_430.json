    "text": "[Voting: Vote Fraud](/Subjects/00023-LAST-voting-vote-fraud.htm) • https://www.thegatewaypundit.com, By Jim Hoft [BREAKING: Now There's Proof! Brad Raffensperger Lied to President Trump When He Told...](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/12/breaking-now-theres-proof-brad-raffensperger-lied-president/) In late December 2020, President Trump [made a call](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/03/politics/trump-brad-raffensperger-phone-call-transcript/index.html) to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking him to look at some of the items that were uncovered by his auditor. There was plenty of evidence for a competent auditor or any man of integrity to know that the election was uncertifiable. Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger's office secretly recorded the phone call with President Trump, then lied about its contents later when they [leaked it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-transcript-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/2768e0cc-4ddd-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html) to the far-left Washington Post. Raffensperger's office ran to the Washington Post and leaked a fraudulent transcript of the call. After they were caught lying to the American public, The Washington Post outed Jordan Fuchs as their anonymous source for the garbage hit piece. Fuchs provided the WaPo with a fraudulent Trump quote that the paper ran in an anti-Trump hit piece on January 9th. They planned this to do the most damage to President Trump before the sham impeachment trial in the US Senate. Georgia Chairman of the Republican Party David Shafer later [revealed](https://twitter.com/DavidShafer/status/1371531429427970055?s=20) that Raffensperger and Fuchs [lied to](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/03/confirmed-dirtbag-raffensberger-aides-secretly-recorded-trumps-phone-call-lied-contents-far-left-wapo-deleted-audio-trash-folder/) the Washington Post about Trump, demanding that they \"find the fraud.\" Then, after they leaked their version of the story to the Washington Post, they deleted the audio of the call. The audio file was later found in the laptop's \"trash\" folder.",

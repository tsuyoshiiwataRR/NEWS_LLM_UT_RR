    "text": "One of the most influential workers unions in Argentina has called for a national strike next month as opposition to the government’s overhaul of the economy builds.\nThe General Confederation of Labor (CGT) announced on Thursday that it is planning a general strike on Jan. 24 in protest against a series of measures put forward by libertarian President Javier Milei.\nMilei’s government sent a reform bill to Congress on Wednesday proposing far-reaching changes in an attempt to help resurrect the ailing economy. It includes changes to working standards and would pave the way for the privatization of state companies.\nIn a statement, the CGT, which brings together several powerful unions in the South American country, presented its “fighting plan.” Members, the statement said, will request meetings with lawmakers who are due to discuss the bill in extraordinary sessions scheduled through Jan. 31 to propose amendments.\nSeveral demonstrations against Milei’s agenda have taken place since he took office Dec. 10, although numbers in recent days have fallen behind expectations.\nMilei’s newly appointed security minister presented a “protocol” earlier this month to maintain public order that allows federal forces to stop demonstrators from holding road-blocking protests. Some social organizations have said that the protocol goes too far, setting up a potential clash with those pledging to take to the streets.\nOf the 42 general strikes called by the CGT since 1983, more than half have been during non-Peronist governments. Five strikes took place under former center-right President Mauricio Macri, who took office in 2015 and supported Milei’s electoral campaign.\n ",

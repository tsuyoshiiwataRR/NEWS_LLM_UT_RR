We maintain an optimistic outlook on the Japanese market, anticipating its continued contribution to tourism as we progress into 2024.\nThe impact of the Maui wildfires continues to be felt in November’s figures, but with most of West Maui now reopened to tourism, there is a concerted effort to reinvigorate job opportunities and facilitate the economic recovery of Maui.\n# # #\nMedia Contacts:\nLaci Goshi\nDepartment of Business, Economic Development and Tourism\n808-518-5480\nJennifer Chun\nDirector of Tourism Research\nDepartment of Business, Economic Development and Tourism\n808-973-9446\n[[1]](#_ftnref1) Average daily census measures the number of visitors present on any given day.",

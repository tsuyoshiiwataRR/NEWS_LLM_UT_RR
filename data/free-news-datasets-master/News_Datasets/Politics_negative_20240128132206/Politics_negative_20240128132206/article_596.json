    "text": "An Asian rapper who made a record blaming “incompetent city officials” for San Francisco’s crime rate has asked for an apology of sorts.\nChino Yang, 35, who grew up in the city, called Mayor London Breed a “clown” and a “fake liberal” in his latest song, “San Francisco Our Home.”\nThe rapper said he was motivated to produce the song because he is “fed up with crimes,” including his restaurant being robbed seven times.\nYang is well known in the Chinese-speaking world thanks to his appearance on The Rap of China (中国新说唱) and other television shows.\n“Now, London Breed, you’re nothing but a clown / When we really needed you, you were never here,” Yang rapped on the track.\nChinese-American rapper Chino Yang has slammed San Francisco Mayor London Breed in a new song calling her a ‘clown’ and a ‘fake liberal’ for her inability to control crime in the city.\nDuring London Mayor Breed’s tenure (pictured), thefts have increased more than 14 per cent compared to the start of the year, with 2,645 reports.\n“You’ve turned this big city into a zombie land. They do all kinds of shit here that they wouldn’t try in a small town,” he added, in an apparent reference to rampant drug use throughout the city.\nBut on Tuesday night she apologized at length to “our beloved mayor” for “spreading misinformation” about her.\nYang and asked that his family be left out of the furor and took “full responsibility.” [for] my actions.\n“I’ve been receiving a lot of threats lately, especially from someone extremely powerful, someone who has connections to presidents, senators… you know, the most important elites,” he said.\n‘I am simply a civilian, so for the sake of my family, my loved ones and my close friends, I would like to openly and publicly apologize for my actions and what I say in the video.\n‘I had no idea that this extremely powerful individual would have such an emotional attachment to the London Breed.\n‘That said, I’m sorry for my ignorance, I’m sorry for my foolishness and impulsiveness. He should have known more about what she had done for our city.\nOn Tuesday night, Yang issued a lengthy apology to ‘our beloved mayor’ for ‘spreading misinformation’ about her.\nYang also clarified that his song and video were not directed at San Francisco’s black community, only because Breed was black.\n‘I still stand firm in my beliefs and opinions. The last thing I want to express is my love for the black and brown community. “I grew up with all my black and brown people…I have nothing but love for them, I never fake it,” he said.\nYang said he was always positive about black people with his Chinese friends and that the song had nothing to do with “creating division” between the two communities.\nHe didn’t back down entirely, adding a poll asking whether politicians should be “responsible for the city’s decline and failure.”\nYang recently suffered a heart attack and said he was unprepared to deal with the growing fallout from his video as a result.\nEarlier, Yang was singing a different tune, remaining defiant despite backlash from the mayor’s supporters and a rally planned by former Mayor Willie Brown and local NAACP president the Rev. Amos Brown.\n“I’m tired of crime and incompetent city officials, so if they don’t care about us, it’s up to us to take a stand and exercise our constitutional rights,” he said in a video.\nHe displayed a handwritten sign on the door of his Kung Food restaurant telling would-be thieves there was no cash to steal.\n‘We don’t have any more money in the cash register. Those tablets aren’t worth much! Who has money in Joe’s economy? Come on, partner!’ he read.\nPreviously, Yang was singing a different tune, remaining defiant despite backlash from the mayor’s supporters with follow-up videos doubling down on his criticism.\nYang displayed a handwritten sign on the door of his Kung Food restaurant telling would-be thieves that there was no cash to steal.\nYang wrote alongside the video: ‘Make San Francisco great again! God bless the land of the free and the home of the brave! Do not fear because I am with you!\n‘There is no shame in being a Christian, being a father figure, supporting the national economy!\n“It’s a shame that the most patriotic Americans weren’t even born here.”\nYang’s diss track referenced some of San Francisco’s most prominent crime problems and accused Breed and other local politicians of failing to improve them.\nDrug overdose deaths in the city are at their highest in San Francisco, with 620 in the first nine months of the year, according to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, up from 540 during the same period in 2020.\nPolice data showed thefts were up more than 14 percent compared to the start of the year, with 2,645 reports.\nMotor vehicle theft, which Chino Yang also addresses, also increased with 4,464 vehicle thefts since Jan. 1, an increase of nearly six percent.\nYang’s diss track referenced some of San Francisco’s most prominent crime problems and accused Breed and other local politicians of failing to improve them.\nChino Yang also uses the song to talk about Asian hate by referencing several high-profile cases of anti-Asian violence, including the murders of two-year-old Jasper Wu and 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee, and Yohannes ‘John’ Tewolde.\nYang addressed the spiral of car thefts by paying homage to Scott McKenzie’s famous 1960s popular song, ‘San Francisco.’\nBut she changed the lyrics about wearing flowers in her hair to ‘If you’re going to San Francisco / Make sure you don’t leave anything in your car.’\nAt the beginning of his music video, the rapper also revealed that his restaurant, Kung Food, was robbed seven times.\n“I have no choice but to record this distortion track,” he said.\nThe rest of his video was also covered in images of victims of anti-Asian violence in the Bay Area, with the rapper criticizing the soft justice that was seen delivered to several high-profile victims of Asian hate.\nAmong those mentioned are two-year-old Jasper Wu, shot dead on the highway, the death of 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee, and Yohannes ‘John’ Tewolde, killed in Richmond Market.\nSan Francisco is mired in a homelessness crisis that officials tried to gloss over during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade summit last month; However, a few days after the event ended, the chaotic scenes returned to the streets.\nOther clips include a 91-year-old Asian man being pushed to the ground, 84-year-old Rongxin Liao being fly-kicked while sitting on her mobility device, and the bloodied face of Grandma Xie, who was caught on camera. camera trying to fight. her attacker.\nTheir song was released a month after officials attempted to clean up the city during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum trade summit.\nAuthorities tried everything from clearing encampments to deploying “night ambassadors” to keep homeless people out of the area.\nThe unprecedented measures were designed to present a clean, bright image during the summit, the city’s largest gathering of world leaders since 1945, and avoid the kind of street specialties that have damaged the city’s reputation.\nBut within days of the event concluding, the city lost its luster and the familiar scenes of homeless encampments and drug use on the streets returned.\nSome of these views appear in Chino Yang’s video, along with videos and images of car thefts.\nThe rapper was born in China, but moved to San Francisco when he was a teenager. He has appeared on numerous Chinese talent shows and has more than 320,000 followers on the Chinese social media app Weibo.\nDailyMail.com has contacted the mayor’s office for comment.",

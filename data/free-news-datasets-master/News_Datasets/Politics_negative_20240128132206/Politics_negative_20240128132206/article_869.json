    "text": "|\nSupport\nContact\nPowered by\n|\nBiden: You Know, the Ukrainians Will Probably Have to Cede Territory to Russia to End This War\nVia\nWith U.S. and European aid to Ukraine now in serious jeopardy, the Biden administration and European officials are quietly shifting their focus from supporting Ukraine's goal of total victory over Russia to improving its position in an eventual negotiation to end the war, according to a Biden administration official and a European diplomat based in Washington. Such a negotiation would likely mean giving up parts of Ukraine to Russia. The White House and Pentagon publicly insist there is no official change in administration policy -- that they still support Ukraine's aim of forcing Russia's military completely out of the country. But along with the Ukrainians themselves, U.S. and European officials are now discussing the redeployment of Kyiv's forces away from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's mostly failed counteroffensive into a stronger defensive position against Russian forces in the east, according to the administration official and the European diplomat, and confirmed by a senior administration official.\nThe White House signals to Politico that the war in Ukraine will end through negotiation, probably by giving up territory, something which if you said 6 months ago made you Putin's right hand man https://t.co/qkOPu0Lv6n pic.twitter.com/vacxWoKofr -- Zaid Jilani (@ZaidJilani) December 27, 2023\nBlinken on previous levels of funding and arming: \"These levels of support and assistance will no longer be necessary.\"\nPosted by: Disinformation Expert Ace at\nComments\nWho didn't see this one coming?\nPosted by: Bosk of Port Kar at December 28, 2023 05:12 PM (Rn/yD)\nPosted by: Grudge Harbor at December 28, 2023 05:12 PM (hCzfy)\nPosted by: Cicero (@cicero43) at December 28, 2023 05:13 PM (eaI2m)\nPosted by: Cicero (@cicero43) at December 28, 2023 05:14 PM (eaI2m)\nI've got nothing to add, so will wish you all a good night.\nPosted by: Mary Poppins' Practically Perfect Piercing (aka Eloquent Depression) at December 28, 2023 05:14 PM (Q0kLU)\nAnd I think he will do what he wanted to do when he was knifed in the back by the LE/IC, and that is forge an alliance with Russia.\nAlso pro-tip to Trump and his satellites, when you win the election, do not take any calls or talk to anyone until you are sworn in.\nPosted by: Thomas Bender at December 28, 2023 05:14 PM (XV/Pl)\nYou don't say...\nPosted by:\n___________\nNew grift coming up!

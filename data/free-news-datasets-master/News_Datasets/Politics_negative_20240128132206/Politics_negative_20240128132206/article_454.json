    "text": "LAHORE: Chief of Jamaat-e-Islami Sirajul Haq has said that there is no substantive difference between the PML-N, the PPP and the PTI, as these former ruling parties are two sides of the same coin.\nSpeaking at a press conference at Mansoorah on Thursday, he said many so-called leaders who are part of these parties were opportunistic, turn coats and acted as migratory birds that align themselves with whichever party is poised to come into power.\nHaq, later, alongside JI Secretary General Amirul Azim, also launched the JI election symbol “Scale.”\nWhen asked, Sirajul Haq said the political workers have no place in the so-called mainstream parties when it comes to distributing party tickets, as these parties tend to favour their relatives. These parties, he said, function as family clubs, primarily focused on capturing power and securing their interests. Despite frequently coming to power, he contended that the mainstream parties have consistently failed to address the country’s problems. He said a new class of political Brahmans are now also emerging on country’s political\nlandscape with the launch of the sons and daughters of the heads of the ruling parties.\nIn response to a question, Haq said the ruling elite amassed wealth for themselves and their families, looting resources, taking loans, and subsequently having those loans waived off. He asserted that 90 percent of foreign loans were utilized for their personal benefits, contributing to the country’s massive debt. He said the corrupt ruling elite annually utilize $18 billion of resources for personal gain, rendering the current system incapable of benefiting the common man. He argued that as long as the ruling mafias remain intact, public welfare and the country’s prosperity will remain elusive. He attributed the collapsed economy and weakened institutions to the flawed policies of the former governments of dictators and so-called democratic political parties.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2023\nComments\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281070/first-half-of-jan24-pol-products-prices-may-be-sustained\">First half of Jan’24: POL products’ prices may be sustained\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281043/ex-ruling-parties-two-sides-of-the-same-coin-ji-chief\">Ex-ruling parties two sides of the same coin: JI chief\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281055/solar-panel-imports-pca-south-uncovers-another-money-laundering-offence\">Solar panel imports: PCA South uncovers another money laundering offence\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281058/sindh-bilawal-says-nomination-papers-not-being-snatched\">Sindh: Bilawal says nomination papers not being snatched\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281068/dozens-arrested-in-pro-palestinian-protests-at-two-major-us-airports\">Dozens arrested in pro-Palestinian protests at two major US airports\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281066/ecp-directs-punjab-govt-to-ensure-a-level-playing-field\">ECP directs Punjab govt to ensure a level playing field\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281065/ecp-accepts-nawazs-nomination-papers\">ECP accepts Nawaz’s nomination papers\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281064/army-commits-to-offering-support-for-elections\">Army commits to offering support for elections\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281063/imported-coal-based-projects-ecc-okays-settlement-of-issues-with-pqepcl\">Imported coal-based projects: ECC okays settlement of issues with PQEPCL\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281062/anti-polio-drive-pm-seeks-ulemas-help\">Anti-polio drive: PM seeks Ulema’s help\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281059/fd-outlook-misreports-fbr-collection-data\">FD Outlook misreports FBR collection data\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281057/wapda-employees-phc-suspends-notification-to-end-free-electricity\">WAPDA employees: PHC suspends notification to end free electricity\n</a>\nRead more stories Next Story",

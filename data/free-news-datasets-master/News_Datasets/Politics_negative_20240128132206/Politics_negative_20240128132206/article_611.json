    "text": "Mark Dreyfus, Australia’s acting foreign minister, announced on Thursday that an Israeli attack in Lebanon claimed the lives of two Australian citizens, Ibrahim Bazzi and his brother Ali Bazzi. From Sydney, Ibrahim Bazzi had traveled to Lebanon to join his Lebanese bride Shorouq Hammoud on her way to Australia. According to media accounts, Hammoud—who had just been granted an Australian visa—was also assassinated in the attack. Funerals for the three were held overnight in Lebanon. The three died in their home following the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) attack, with no signs of fighting nearby preceding the strike. “When they found her she was alive but she died shortly after,” said the official to the National regarding Shourouq’s death. Dreyfus stated that his government had discussed the airstrike with Israel, but he would not unveil what was said, reported ABC News. “In the context of the current conflict, Australia has consistently called for civilian lives to be protected and we have consistently raised our concerns about the risk of this conflict spreading,” Dreyfus said. He restated a government warning cautioning Australians against visiting Lebanon. Australians who have already arrived in the nation ought to depart as soon as commercial flights continue to operate. He also stated that if the Bazzi family needed consular support, the Australian embassy in Beirut was prepared to help.",

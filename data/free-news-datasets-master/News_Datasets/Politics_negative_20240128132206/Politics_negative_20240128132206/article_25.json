    "text": " Argentina's newly elected President Javier Milei has introduced a draft bill that could significantly impact cryptocurrency holders in the country.\nThis legislation , part of a broader economic and political reform package, aims to incentivize Argentines to declare both their domestic and foreign cryptocurrency assets.\nIn return, they would benefit from a favorable tax rate and the legalization of these assets, irrespective of their origin or storage location, Coindesk reported .\nPresident Milei, who gained popularity in the crypto community for his positive stance on Bitcoin BTC/USD during his campaign, has seen his omnibus bill spark considerable controversy and protests since its announcement on Tuesday. The bill proposes a unique asset regularization program that encompasses various assets, including cryptocurrencies.\nUnder the proposed regime, Argentines who declare their cryptocurrency holdings by March 31 would benefit from a reduced tax rate of 5%.\nAlso Read: Ethereum Dethroned - Solana Memes Like Bonk, Samoyed Coin, Dogwifhat Unleash $1.5B DEX Frenzy\nHowever, this rate is set to increase significantly to 15% after Nov. 30.\nThe draft bill states that these concessions apply to \"cryptocurrencies, crypto assets, and other similar goods, regardless of who has been their issuer, who is their owner or where they were deposited, guarded or stored.\"\nThis move by Milei is seen as part of Argentina's ongoing efforts to address its longstanding economic challenges, which include severe inflation and currency instability.\nThe country has previously implemented amnesty programs targeting billions of dollars in cash or assets held abroad by its citizens.\nThe current proposal aims to bring a similar approach to the burgeoning world of digital assets.\nRead Next: Crypto 'Wild West' Hurts Investors, SEC Chair Says: Bankruptcy Court Queues Are Crowded\nImage: Pixabay\n ",

    "text": "Re: the Dec. 24 article \"Rumors, headlines factor in border rush.\" Thanks to Emily Bregel, for this article. Her report Christmas Eve? Politicians’ untruthful rhetoric and then news disseminating their misinformation don’t escape news-savvy people in the Americas. Statements we’ve heard, like “open borders” offer smugglers huge paydays from people dreaming of such opportunities, affirmed by American leaders’ quotes. Wouldn’t you act if you were desperate? Add rumors smugglers create, implicitly supported in December by Congress not moving on support for “CBP One Application” or personnel. Smugglers say the Program is closing. “Don’t apply and wait, just come.” Frustrated? Write Republican Rep. Ciscomani. Ask him what he’s been saying! Our Senators are working for solutions. Yet Republicans want immigration “broken.” Fundraising for 2024; “It’s all Biden’s fault.” Yet the Biden Administration’s Homeland Security Application Process initially slowed the migration process! Trump’s $15 billion wall? Impotent! Buy a $100 reciprocating saw. Wall breaching has occurred thousands of times, costing millions more for repairs. Republicans: Tell the truth! Cooperate!

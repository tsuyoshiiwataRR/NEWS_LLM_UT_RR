    "text": "Dec. 28 (UPI) -- New York City Mayor Eric Adams issued an executive order Wednesday regulating bus arrivals as Republican governors continue busing migrants and asylum seekers to so-called \"sanctuary cities.\"\nA state of emergency, which Adams declared in October 2022, is still in effect as migrants continue to arrive. Advertisement\n\"Over the past several months, thousands of asylum seekers have been arriving in New York City, from the southern border, without having any immediate plans for shelter,\" Adams wrote in Emergency Executive Order 538 .\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbot has implemented a policy of sending migrants to other states via chartered buses and flights . According to the mayor's office, more than 161,000 migrants have arrived since 2022. Related Democrat mayors call on Biden for help amid migrant surge they blame on Texas Blinken, Mayorkas travel to Mexico for key immigration meeting Texas flies immigrants to Chicago in expansion of Gov. Greg Abbott's busing plan\n\"The city now faces an unprecedented humanitarian crisis that requires it to take extraordinary measures to meet the immediate needs of the asylum seekers while continuing to serve the tens of thousands of people who are currently using the Department of Homeless Services' Shelter System,\" Adams said.\nOn Wednesday, Adams held a press conference calling on the Biden administration to declare a federal emergency and provide financial support.\n\"Cities cannot keep doing the federal government's job for them,\" Adams said. Advertisement\nThe order says the entities sending migrants via buses know the migrants will need shelter when they arrive and that they are being dropped off in \"random locations.\"\nAny driver who knows, or \"reasonably should know,\" that recent arrivals are being sent via their bus routes by third parties will be required to contact the Office of Emergency Management at least 32 hours in advance.\nDrivers also would be required to provide passenger manifests.\nThe executive order also requires drivers to drop off the passengers between 8:30 a.m. and noon Monday through Friday.",

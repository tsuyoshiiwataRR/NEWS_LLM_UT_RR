    "text": "Engagement center in Manchester reports new data on homeless population Officials say housing crisis biggest driver of homelessness Officials say housing crisis biggest driver of homelessness Officials say housing crisis biggest driver of homelessness Two months after Manchester's new homeless engagement center opened, new data is revealing more information about the city's homeless population. Advocates said the data is the first step toward finding solutions. The center opened in September as an expansion of the city's emergency shelter at 39 Beech St. It's open seven days per week and offers showers, bathrooms, warm meals, clothes, a place to pick up mail, and a chance to connect with mental health, housing and addiction services. \"We are going to give you a moment out of the cold and chaos to try to recollect you on what your goals are and support in any which way we can,\" said Adrienne Beloin, director of Manchester Housing Stability. Beloin said the center is the first location in the state that has started to collect well-rounded data on the people it serves. \"We are doing it,\" she said. \"We're not required, but we are doing it because we believe in having robust data to wrap our arms around the problems and create solutions.\" Beloin said that over the past two months, nearly 200 people used the engagement center. Fifty percent reported mental health disorders, 46% reported substance misuse and 47% reported a physical disability. Beloin said the lack of housing for everyone in the Granite State is now the primary driver of homelessness. \"A lot of people feel like mental health and substance misuse are primary drivers of homelessness, and in past years, that could've been true, but that's not true right now because we are in a housing crisis,\" she said. \"So, not surprisingly, we see older folks who have never been homeless before coming into our center. We see a lot of people living in their cars. We see people for lack of housing that are currently homeless.\" Beloin said the information could be used to secure more federal funding and to make decisions about new programs and services. \"Data is king,\" she said. \"We have not had really good data in New Hampshire on homelessness, and we are trying to improve that. It's one of the first stepping stones to truly problem solve in their community and figure out what kinds of things need to be added.\"",

    "text": "Quote History Originally Posted By ras_al_ghul:\nThe south seceded because they saw the writing on the wall with regards to slavery, Lincoln was just the cherry on top. Mostly it was because all future states would be admitted as abolitionist states and inevitably cause a nationwide banning of slavery.\nThe north attacked the south because they more or less decided it was illegal to succeed from the United States and the south tried to claim federal property.\nThe south attacked the north because the north attacked the south. The north attacked the south because they succeeded so that could continue to have slaves.\nThe southern states all listed slavery as the reason for succession, the Confederate constitution required that all member states allow slavery (they banned slave bans effectively), and the last of the slave states to be freed by the 14th amendment were in the north (Delaware if I recall).\nMy entire post ignores the social and economic tit-for-tat between the north and south that existed for decades culminating in a civil war. Those would be other contributory reasons for the war, but they all ultimately lead back to slavery as an underlying cause.\nView Quote\nJust.... no.",

    "text": "2023-12-28 21:25:59 The far-right Javier Milei sent this Wednesday to Congress a bill that declares the country in a “public emergency” and includes 664 articles that fundamentally change a good part of the political, social and economic structure of Argentina. The omnibus law, as it is called due to its extension and variety of topics, involves the transfer to the executive branch of broad legislative powers in economic, financial, pension, fiscal, health and even electoral matters. The project, which will be discussed in extraordinary sessions by Congress, also includes a toughening of sanctions against social protest. Milei intends that any “intentional and temporary congregation of three or more people” be considered a demonstration punishable by up to six years in prison if it impedes free movement or the provision of public services. The text sent to Congress, Milei’s most forceful political initiative since he assumed power in Argentina at the beginning of the month, warns that any demonstration must be notified in advance and the Ministry of Security may oppose or propose changes. In addition, social organizers must declare who is responsible for the calls to facilitate their identification in case they deserve criminal sanctions. The bill gives form to law to the anti-protest protocol signed two weeks ago by the Minister of Security, Patricia Bullrich. Added to the bill submitted on Wednesday are other previous actions that have increased social discontent during the first three weeks in the Casa Rosada. First, it was the decalogue of economic measures announced by the Minister of Economy, Luis Caputo, who devalued the currency by 50% and announced the elimination of subsidies for transportation and energy starting in January, among other measures. This week, the Government also annulled the contracts of at least 5,000 state employees, after signing a decree with hundreds of reforms that, according to the Executive’s reading, did not need to go through Congress. In the list of reforms proposed by the legislative project, pompously called “Law of bases and starting points for the freedom of Argentines”, is the power of the Executive to privatize fifty public companies, the end of the primary elections of the parties and a restructuring of the Chamber of Deputies that makes it easier to add parliamentarians to second and third electoral forces, as is currently the government party, La Libertad Avanza. The law, if approved, intervenes on all types of issues. Free public universities, for example, will be able to charge foreign students for their training; It also promotes laundering of large fortunes that have been evading taxes for years. Milei’s proposal declares the country in a situation of “public emergency” until December 31, 2025. This very long period can also be extended for another two years, which would cover the entire term of the president. It is this situation of supposed public emergency that enables the Government to assume powers that correspond to the legislative power. The Argentine Constitution prevents this transfer of powers “except in specific matters of administration or public emergency, with a deadline set for its exercise and within the bases of the delegation that Congress establishes.” Call to strike The General Confederation of Workers (CGT) and the Central Workers of Argentina (CTA), the country’s main union centers, met this Thursday to evaluate the next steps against the far-right reforms. The CGT announced a strike for January 24 after noon. That day they will once again test the protest control protocol implemented to prohibit street closures. They already did it this Wednesday when more than 20,000 people, according to the organizers, staged the first demonstration of strength by the unions. It was inevitable that attendees would hit the pavement due to the size of the gathering and the mobilization ended in tension.

The demand was directed at the labor unions, to whom the protesters demanded that they call a general strike. The unions have been “measuring the thermometer,” according to organizational sources told this newspaper, and defining their strategies prudently. Rodolfo Aguiar, national secretary of the State Workers Association, which is part of the CTA, assessed before the announcement of the general strike that “the conditions for a strike are set.” “The workers expect their representatives to be able to join forces and we hope that the central leaders rise to the occasion,” urged Aguiar, who told EL PAÍS that “time is on Milei’s side” because the decree of necessity emergency imposed by the far-right comes into force on Friday. The reform package can be stopped in Congress or in the courts, but until that happens, the measures will be laws. In addition, the omnibus law will begin to be discussed by Congress in extraordinary sessions. Protesters in the square in front of the Palace of Justice in Buenos Aires, on Wednesday.AGUSTIN MARCARIAN (REUTERS) For leftist parties and movements, the call for a strike was pressing. On Wednesday they supported the demonstration, but from another place in the square, in an independent column. “We came to demand the national strike and the plan of struggle, which corresponds to the seriousness of the situation,” said Eduardo Belliboni, leader of the Polo Obrero, during the rally. For Guillermo Kane, legislator and leader of the Partido Obrero, the march was nothing more than “symbolic.” “We need fundamental action,” demanded the politician. “The CGT, which has not carried out a strike in four years, has not been playing a role in active defense of the workers,” said the legislator. Different organizations, movements and political parties have already warned that they will continue to mobilize against measures that they consider an “availability” of their rights. Not only in the streets. In recent weeks, different sectors – organized and self-convened neighbors – have held assemblies throughout the country, cacerolazos and popular pots to offer food to people who need it. The far-right government faces a long season of mobilizations and resistance, but it is also confident in the support that the polls gave it.

    "text": "Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has\ncalled for the US to bomb Iran in response to Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, saying Iranian bases and oil fields should be blown “off the map.”\nThe hawkish senator claimed that without Iran, there would be no Houthis. But the Houthis, formally known as Ansar Allah, are a homegrown movement of Zaydi Shia Muslims. Zaydi Shia Imams ruled the area of north Yemen that the Houthis now control\nfor about 1,000 years until 1962.\n“Without Iran there are no Houthis,” Graham told Fox & Friends on Wednesday. “The Houthis are completely backed by Iran. I have been saying for six months now…hit Iran. They have oil fields out in the open, they have the Revolutionary Guard headquarters you can see from space. Blow it off the map.”\nThe Houthis have been targeting Israel-linked commercial shipping in the Red Sea and have made clear they will not stop until Israel ends its siege on Gaza. The US launched a military operation in response but has not targeted the Houthis directly, which would involve bombing Yemen.\nGraham criticized the Biden administration for not bombing the Houthis, which would jeopardize a peace deal in Yemen. “We’re fighting the Houthis. We beat the Germans and the Japanese. We should be able to beat the Houthis. Secretary Austin and the Biden administration’s failing our troops in the field,” he said.\nKnow for his extremely hawkish rhetoric, Graham has been a staunch backer of Israel’s massacre in Gaza, previously\n saying there’s “no limit” to how many civilians Israel can kill. He also described the situation in Gaza as a “religious war” and called for Gaza to be completely leveled.",

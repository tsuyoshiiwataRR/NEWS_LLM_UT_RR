    "text": "EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) â€” A large group of migrants was reported on the Mexican side of the border wall at gate 36 on Wednesday night. Border Patrol officials said the migrants are set up in that area west of Riverside High School on the Cesar Chavez Border Highway. Officials said migrants illegally crossed the border after cutting the concertina wire along the Rio Grande River or placing clothing or pieces of cardboard over the wire. Border Patrol officials said the group is of about 100 people. The group was mostly composed of single adults and families, mostly of Venezuelan origin. \"All migrants encountered at BSI 36 or any other location in-between a port of entry are transported to a processing facility and processed under Title 8, which will place migrants who cross the border unlawfully into removal proceedings,\" Border Patrol officials said.

    "text": "NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi stoked the quota controversy raging in Maharashtra standing on RSS’s home turf on Thursday, asking why PM Narendra Modi was “suddenly cagey about calling himself an OBC after our party raised the caste census issue”.“Now, he has blurred caste lines and prefers to bracket people into ‘poor’ or ‘underprivileged’ categories. Why this hypocrisy?” he said at a packed Azad Maidan on Congress’s 139th foundation day.Rahul was the sole Gandhi torchbearer at the “Hai Tayyar Hum” rally, with mother Sonia Gandhi and sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra giving the event a miss. 106358174 106359504 106194789“There are 50% OBCs, 15% Scheduled Castes and 12% tribals (in Maharashtra); yet only 3 of the top 90 IAS officers in the state are from the backward castes. Even they have marginal postings. When we questioned this discrimination, the government had no answer, and our MPs were suspended,” Rahul said.He iterated Congress' commitment to a caste-based census if voted to government at the Centre. The Wayanad MP also targeted the Sangh, saying his party liberated people from British rule while RSS was allegedly pushing the country back to oppressive colonial times.“During British times, there were also several princely states and the king was law. Today, there are voting rights for all, and citizens enjoy privileges because of Congress. RSS only wants to take India back to the pre-independence era,” he said.“The Sangh has captured institutions across the country, and no vice-chancellor in any university is appointed on merit. They have to be affiliated to a certain organisation to get the post.”The former Congress president also spoke about rising joblessness in the country due to the BJP-led Centre's alleged failure to create opportunities for the youth.After Rahul’s blitz from the dais, it was Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge’s turn to take on RSS. He alleged that the Nagpur-headquartered Sangh fountainhead would ensure Dalits wouldn’t be able to raise their heads again.",

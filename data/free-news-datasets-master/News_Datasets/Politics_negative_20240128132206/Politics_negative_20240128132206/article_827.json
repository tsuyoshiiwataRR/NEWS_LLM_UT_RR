    "text": "Selective memory in accusing Hunter Biden Recently, Debra J. Sanders wrote an article trying to disparage President Joe Biden by telling us the many things that Hunter Biden did wrong. Without any proof, she tries to connect Hunter Biden’s legal transactions with President Biden, trying to infer that as vice president, Joe Biden violated the law. That has already been proven not to be true. Amount involved? $1.2 million. She doesn’t mention how ex-President Trump’s daughter got 41 trademarks approved by China soon after her father became president. I haven’t been able to find the value of those trademarks. She also doesn’t mention the $2 billion dollar deal (well over a thousand times higher than the Hunter Biden deal) that ex-President Trump’s son-in-law closed with Saudi Arabia, which Jared Kushner originally did not report. I don’t feel that I have to mention the blatant bias of Ms. Sanders.

    "text": "SomaLogic (NASDAQ:\nSLGC) founder Larry Gold and Chief Technology Officer Jason Cleveland urged shareholders in an open letter released Thursday to vote against a proposed merger of the company with Standard Bio Tools (NASDAQ: LAB).\nGold and Cleveland said they believe the merger “lacks a clear business rationale” and “shows signs of being undertaken at the direction and for the benefit of Eli Casdin, who is a significant equityholder in both SomaLogic and Standard Bio Tools.” Casdin also sits on the boards of both companies,\naccording to the letter.\nGold and Cleveland said that they filed a class action suit earlier this month against Casdin, Casdin Capital and board members of SomaLogic and Standard Bio Tools alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by approving a merger process “that was rife with conflicts, transacted at an unfair price and undertaken for the benefit of Mr. Casdin and his affiliates and to the detriment of SomaLogic stockholders.”\nShareholders are expected to vote on the merger proposal on Jan. 4.\nSomaLogic and Standard Bio Tools\nannounced plans to merge through an all-stock deal in October.",

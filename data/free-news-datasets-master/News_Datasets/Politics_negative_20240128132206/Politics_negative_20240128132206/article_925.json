    "text": "The home of Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) was swatted Wednesday night in an incident he described as a “sick attempt to terrorize my family.” Scott tweeted that the “cowards” who had swatted his home had “wasted the time [and] resources of our law enforcement.” Swatting occurs when people make false reports of ongoing or recent crimes, leading law enforcement personnel to rush to the scenes. Naples police are investigating the incident and have not yet identified a suspect or a motive, McGinn said. A spokesman for Scott said there were no additional details immediately available. The attempt was one in a string of swatting episodes against politicians in recent days, including in Ohio , Georgia and New York . Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said she had been swatted on Christmas Day , while her family was home celebrating the holiday. On Wednesday night, the Naples Police Department received a non-emergency call from a person claiming he had “shot his wife with an AR-15 three times while she was sleeping,” according to the incident report. The caller also told the dispatcher he was holding a hostage and demanded $10,000, saying he would “blow up the house” with a pipe bomb if he was not given the money, the report states. Police said the caller, who said his name was Jamal, did not provide additional identifying information. The caller’s voice also “sounded as if it was computer generated/artificial,” according to the department’s release. Officers who searched Scott’s home on Wednesday found no signs of forced entry or the pipe bomb and other items described by the caller, police said. Several recent swatting attempts have targeted Republican figures such as Scott. Rep. Brandon Williams (R-N.Y.), tweeted on Tuesday that he had also been swatted on Christmas in an incident that put his “family’s lives at risk.” Greene tweeted that the Christmas swatting call was “like the 8th” she had experienced, later adding that similar incidents occurred at the homes of her two daughters. “Whoever is doing this, you are going to get caught and it won’t be funny to you anymore,” Greene wrote, describing the hoaxes as “police harassment.” At least four Georgia state senators and Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones have also been swatted over the last week, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported . Earlier this week, Republican Rep. Kevin Miller of Ohio said he had been swatted when police received a report of a shooting at his home. Miller called the incident “a huge waste of resources” in a statement on The Naples Police Department said while swatting isn’t a new threat, it has evolved, with offenders using new technology when calling in false reports. “The response often prompts confusion on the part of the homeowners and pulls limited resources away from other possible valid emergencies,” the department said in its statement.",

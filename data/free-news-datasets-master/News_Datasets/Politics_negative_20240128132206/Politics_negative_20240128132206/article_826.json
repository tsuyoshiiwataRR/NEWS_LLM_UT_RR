    "text": "Screwed-up immigration When Illinois and Chicago declared that the Land of Lincoln a sanctuary for migrants from south of the border it sounded compassionate and caring. Oops ... that was then, this is now. Illinois and Chicago never anticipated the flood of Latin Americans, Pakistanis, Africans and who knows who else coming across the wide-open border. Now, Chicago and other towns are ticketing and fining bus companies for dropping migrants wherever. Yes, being a sanctuary state sounds good if there are no migrants to deal with. Well, Pritzker and Johnson now know how towns in Texas feel ... overwhelmed by the tidal wave of people pouring across the Rio Grande. Not such a good idea after all. Biden and company have screwed up the immigration process, that was working, into a a problem that will take decades to repair. Joe and Kamala have produced quite a legacy.

    "text": "Biden administration threatens to sue Texas if its strict immigration law is implemented Abbott signed the measure into law earlier this month. The Biden administration on Thursday warned Texas that it would sue the Lone Star state if it implements a law that would allow state officials to arrest immigrants who cross the border illegally. The Justice Department said it would file a lawsuit against the [legislation titled SB4](https://hro.house.texas.gov/pdf/ba884/sb0004.pdf#navpanes=0), by Jan. 3, unless Texas assured the administration that the state would not go through with enforcing the measure. \"Because SB 4 is unconstitutional and will disrupt the federal government's operations, we request that Texas forbear in its enforcement,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton said in a letter to Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott, [according to CBS News.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-immigration-law-sb4-justice-department-threatens-lawsuit/) Abbott signed the measure into law earlier this month. It is slated to take effect in March of 2024. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other groups have [already filed lawsuits](https://justthenews.com/government/courts-law/aclu-and-other-groups-sue-texas-over-law-allowing-arrest-illegals-state) against this law. “The bill overrides bedrock constitutional principles and flouts federal immigration law while harming Texans, in particular Brown and Black communities,” said Adriana Piñon, legal director of the ACLU of Texas. National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd, meanwhile, praised Abbott's border security measure. \"Border Patrol agents nationwide, not just in Texas, are grateful for Governor Abbott's leadership and willingness to recognize that it is the rule of law that keeps all Americans safe,\" Judd said.",

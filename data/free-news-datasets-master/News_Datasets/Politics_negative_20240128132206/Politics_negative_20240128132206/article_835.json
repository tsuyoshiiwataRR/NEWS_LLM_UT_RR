    "text": "Ex-Zimbabwe player also wore black armband as protest Lost his international cricket career as a result of messageWarms Khawaja could follow in the footsteps of sacked rugby star\nFormer Zimbabwean cricketer Henry Olonga, known for his black armband protest during the 2003 World Cup, has warned Australian star Usman Khawaja he could become the next Israel Folau if he keeps defying authorities to send political messages on the pitch.\nIn the lead-up to the first Test against Pakistan in Perth, Khawaja donned shoes bearing the slogans ‘freedom is a human right’ and ‘all lives are equal’ during training.\nThe messages were prominently displayed in red, green, and black, mirroring the colors of the Palestinian flag.\nWhen the ICC banned him from displaying the words during the Test match, he choose to wear a black armband to show his support instead and has been charged by cricket’s governing body as a result.\nOlonga, who experienced the ramifications of taking a political stance on the cricket field firsthand, expressed his support for Khawaja’s right to express his views but stressed the potential risks involved.\nAustralian opener Usman Khawaja wore a black armband in support of Palestinians during the first Test against Pakistan in Perth\nKhawaja initially wore shoes with the messages ‘freedom is a human right’ and ‘all lives are equal’ before the ICC stepped in to ban them – and he put tape over those words (pictured)\nA banner featuring the messages ‘freedom is a human right’ and ‘all lives are equal’ was unfurled during the Perth Test before security confiscated it\nOlonga’s own career took a significant hit after he and teammate Andrew Flower donned black armbands during the 2003 World Cup to mourn ‘the death of democracy’ under Zimbabwe’s then-president, dictator Robert Mugabe.\nObserving Khawaja’s recent black armband gesture during the first Test against Pakistan in Perth, Olonga endorsed the cricketer’s Instagram post, which highlighted Khawaja’s distress over the human toll in the Israel-Palestine conflict.\nDespite Khawaja’s intent to promote a humanitarian ‘all lives are equal’ stance, the ICC had not granted permission for the armband.\nNow facing potential consequences, Khawaja’s actions have brought the ICC’s position into question, with Olonga arguing that the governing body’s handling of the situation reveals a double standard.\n‘The same people saying politics and sport don’t mix are the same people parading [Australian Prime Minister] Anthony Albanese and (Indian Prime Minister) Narendra Modi in a chariot at the cricket in India and giving them a platform at a sporting event to show solidarity,’ Olonga told News Corp.\n‘So when it is convenient for the ICC they are happy to parade politicians so it’s hard with clean hands for them to come down on Uzzy. It’s weird that they pick and choose their political causes.’\nIsrael Folau was sacked by Rugby Australia for homophobic comments made online that he defended as part of his religious stance\nFolau (pictured with his wife Maria) settled with Rugby Australia out of court for a reported $4million\nOlonga said that Usman would also have to pick and choose his battles moving forward, or face cricket oblivion if the ICC and Cricket Australia think he has taken his messages of support too far.\nHe compared Khawaja to former Wallaby Israel Folau.\nIn 2019, Folau faced contract termination from the Wallabies due to homophobic social media posts, leading to a contentious legal battle with Rugby Australia.\nThe dispute, rooted in allegations of unfair dismissal based on religious beliefs, was eventually settled out of court for a reported $4million, after Folau initially sought $14 million in compensation.\n‘My concern is that if Uzzy digs his heels in he may well find himself on the wrong side of everything. The question is, when should he back off? Has he made his point? Should he back off now? Does he keep going?’ Olonga asked.\n‘In the case of [rugby union’s] Israel Folau [who took a religion-based stance against homosexuality] he kept going and lost his career.\n‘I kept going and I lost my career. History will suggest if Uzzy keeps going this could end his career. I hope it doesn’t. I hope Australia is a much more tolerant country.\nHenry Olonga knows what it is like to lose a cricket career over a political protest\nThe former Zimbabwe international (pictured bowling) wore a black armband at the 2003 Cricket World Cup and consequently lost his place in the team\nOlonga conceded the situation was complex and expects the ICC to pass the buck to Cricket Australia to take action.\n‘I think it is very hard for them to condemn Uzzy for standing up for human rights irrespective of which side of the argument you are on,’ he said.\n‘In my own view I probably don’t lean to support Palestine but I would not begrudge some who does from the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Palestinian people.\n‘I think the ICC may well pass the buck (to Cricket Australia) and they would do well to do that otherwise they would be so hypercritical.\n‘It is a complicated one. If you surveyed 1000 people on this it would be very hard to find a consensus on the issues but he is actually tapping in on something which is universal which is shouldn’t we treat each other with dignity and respect.’",

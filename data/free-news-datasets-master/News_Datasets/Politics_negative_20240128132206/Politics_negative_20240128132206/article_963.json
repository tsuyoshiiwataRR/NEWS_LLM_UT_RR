    "text": "A study out of Syracuse University says just 3.4 percent of practicing journalists in the USA are Republicans. And the only reason the number is that high is Fox News. At the other agencies, the number of GOPers hovers around zero.\nWhy?\nFirst, some disclosure. I am a registered Independent. In my experience, neither party serves the people the way they should. We need problem-solvers in this country, not party apparatchiks.\nRight now, the Democratic Party is hurting the nation big time, so it's Republicans for me by default.\nSocialism, open borders, timid foreign policy, and failure to stem social disorder are bad things. Legalized pot is stupid. Unfettered abortion is amazingly immoral. Being pro-criminal and anti-cop is insane.\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion are ruining the American higher education system.\nDemocrats support all of the above.\nWe have returned to 1860 when the Democratic Party despised Abraham Lincoln's anti-slavery posture. A rational, compassionate, patriotic person would have had a hard time defending Democrats back then.\nHistory will eventually show a similar situation as we approach 2024: a weak, feckless president doing the bidding of the radical left.\nAnd journalists are fine with that because of one tired cliche: \"Don't ... Bite ... The ... Hand ... That ... Feeds ... You.\"\nMedia companies are run by liberal boards as well as managers. And if you're a Republican, they don't want you.\nThat will drive down\"diversity\" every time.\nHope you are enjoying the season.",

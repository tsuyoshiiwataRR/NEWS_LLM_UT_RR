The website where this claim was made has a disclaimer that states it publishes \"humor, parody, and satire\" content.\nThe claim appeared in\nan article (archived here) published by Real Raw News on December 25, 2023, under the title \"Katie Hobbs Was NOT Hanged At GITMO.\" It opened:\nConvicted felon and former Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs received an early Christmas gift Friday morning: She was hanged before a coterie of officers who had arrived at GITMO to witness her final breath.\nThis is how the article looked on Real Raw News at the time of writing:\n(Source: Real Raw News screenshot taken on Thur Dec 28 14:44:03 2023 UTC)\nLead Stories reached out to the Office of the Secretary of Defense to substantiate the validity of this claim. In a December 28, 2023 email, a Pentagon duty officer responded:\nThis is false.\nHobbs published a December 24, 2023, post (archived https://web.archive.org/web/20231228185804/http://web.archive.org/screenshot/https://x.com/GovernorHobbs/status/1739113833225204107?s=20) on her verified X, formerly known as Twitter, account.

For example, the site reported former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was hanged ( she wasn't); former White House Chief of Staff John Podesta was executed ( he wasn't); and \"the military\" convicted former Attorney General William Barr on charges of treason ( it didn't).\nThe website for Real Raw News includes a disclaimer that declares the site does not stand by the contents of the stories, calling them entertainment. Specifically, it\nsays:\nInformation on this website is for informational and educational and entertainment purposes. ...

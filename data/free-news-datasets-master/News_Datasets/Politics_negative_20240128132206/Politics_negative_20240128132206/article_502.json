    "text": "Harry and Meghan must “apologise” to “those they have betrayed” says royal commentato (Image: Getty) If Harry and Meghan were to find a way back into royal life they must “apologise” to “those they have betrayed”, writes royal commentator, Richard Eden. The Palace Confidential broadcaster believes there “could be a way back” into the Royal Family for the duo.\nChristmas is all about forgiveness, Richard Eden writes: “As all Christians know, before forgiveness there needs to be repentance. And we have seen no sign that the California-based couple are prepared to apologise to those they have betrayed with their insults and indiscretions.\n“Until that happens, we may continue to witness the unlikely spectacle of ex-royal Fergie enjoying a more prominent role in the Royal Family than the King’s second son.”\nThe Californian-based couple should also “show some contrition” writes the Daily Mail Diary Editor in the Palace Confidential newsletter.\nHis comments arise as Sarah, the Duchess of York, joined the Royal Family at the Sandringham Christmas service, 30 years after she and Prince Andrew filed for divorce.\nClick here to join our Whatsapp community to be the first to receive news about the Royal family\nREAD MORE: Royal fans say same thing as Earl of Wessex steps out for rare public appearance\nHarry and Meghan at Sandringham for Christmas in 2018 (Image: Getty) For King Charles , the invitation shows his “capacity for forgiveness” as Sarah Ferguson joined her ex-husband, Prince Andrew , and senior members of the Royal Family. Although this comparison has vast differences, Mr Eden said it does show a \"way back\" for the Sussexes.\nThe couple has become the centre of a royal family feud since 2020, after stepping back as senior royals and taking the opportunity to star in their own docu-series on Netflix , publish a memoir and take part in a tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey.\nIt has been widely reported that the claims woven into these public outings has deepened tensions between Prince Harry and his family.\nMr Eden added: “'The King’s embrace of the Duke and Duchess of York shows that there is a way back for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.”\nHe added: “However, unlike Harry and Meghan, Andrew and Sarah have never attacked the Royal Family. Quite the opposite: they have always lavished praise on their relations.”\nDon't miss...\nChristmas moment that tipped the Sussexes 'over the edge', according to expert [SPOTLIGHT]\nClaudia Winkleman’s lesser known sister who is ‘dear friends’ with King Charles [REPORT]\nMeghan 'desperate for fashion endorsement' after 'Dior snub', author claims [LATEST]\nPalace Confidential broadcaster, Richard Eden believes there \"could be a way back\" for the duo (Image: Getty) Become an Express Premium member\nSupport fearless journalism\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free\nGet super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial Trending Prince Harry and Meghan were unsurprisingly absent from Christmas celebrations at Sandringham, and have not spent Christmas in the UK since 2019.\nEntertainment expert, Mark Boardman, told the Daily Express US that the couple are \"certainly not waiting\" for something to come along. Instead, he says, they are \"actively shaping their narrative\".\nThe expert says 2024 looks likely to be a \"more positive year\" for the Sussexes.

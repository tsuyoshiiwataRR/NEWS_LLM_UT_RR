    "text": "By Jim Thomas | Thursday, 28 December 2023 04:28 PM EST On Wednesday, Vladimir Egorov, a 46-year-old political ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was discovered lifeless after plummeting from a third-floor window in Tobolsk, Tyumen Oblast, according to Russian state media, the New York Post reported. Egorov, a United Russia party member and former Tobolsk City Duma deputy, died in the front yard of a residence, exhibiting \"no sign of criminal death on the body,\" sources disclosed. Reports suggest that Egorov might have experienced \"heart problems\" before the fatal fall, an assertion echoed by an unnamed source who remarked, \"One of the most likely reasons is heart problems.\" As is common in Russia, especially amid the conflict with Ukraine, heart-related issues are often cited in explaining untimely or suspicious deaths of public figures. Pathologists are awaiting official autopsy results to determine the precise cause of Egorov's demise. Authorities are actively investigating the circumstances surrounding Egorov's fall, indicating that the incident is not being ruled out as accidental. The deceased, a lawyer, faced a corruption scandal in 2016 that led to his departure from the city administration. Despite this setback, he reentered politics and amassed significant wealth, becoming one of Tobolsk's wealthiest local deputies with an income totaling about $100,500. Egorov, survived by a wife and two children, is the latest in a series of Putin allies whose deaths have raised suspicions. Notably, Lukoil tycoon Ravil Maganov, Russian defense official Marina Yankina, and sausage tycoon Pavel Antov, all linked to Putin, also died under mysterious circumstances, with window falls and or heart problems being cited as factors, according to Newsweek.

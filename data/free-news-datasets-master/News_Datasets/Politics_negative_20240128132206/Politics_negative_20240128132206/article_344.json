    "text": "[Biden-Harris Deep Fake Administration](/Subjects/00774-LAST-biden-harris-deep-fake-administration.htm)\nâ€¢ https://joepags.com, By Joe Pags Staff\nBIDEN'S DOJ SEND OUT MEMO TO JUDGES ASKING TO LOOSEN RESTRICTIONS ON ILLEGAL...\nBiden's Department of Justice sent out a recent memo asking immigration judges to \"treat cases involving migrants under the age of 21 as part of a child docket that loosens restrictions on court absences\" reports the Daily Caller News Foundation.\nThe memo, which was issued December 21st, directs judges to handle cases involving migrants below the age of 21 with less scrutiny and give them second chances if they fail to show up to their court appearances as part of a new \"juvenile docket\".\nThe department and proponents say the creation of a juvenile docket will help address mounting concerns of human trafficking involving children entering the country illegally, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\"Juvenile points of contact will be trained to recognize common indicators of these crimes in order to seek engagement by our ICE colleagues to provide protection and support to these children when needed, while ensuring fair adjudication of their cases before the court. This new initiative is for the well-being of children throughout their immigration proceedings,\" ICE Principal Legal Advisor Kerry E. Doyle said in a statement regarding the program.\nIn cases where a child shows signs that they're a victim of trafficking, abuse and neglect, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) \"may\" open a probe into the matter, according to the memo.\nCritics, however, say this is a Biden administration ruse. \"The administration gives the impression it is concerned about the interests of children in our immigration system, mandating, for example, that ICE attorneys 'will' request a 30-day continuance when children fail to appear in court. But I notice that in the same document, the administration writes only that DHS and HHS 'may' initiate investigations into potential trafficking, abuse, or neglect,\" former ICE Chief of Staff under the Trump administration Jon Feere, who now serves as the director of investigations for the Center for Immigration Studies, told the DCNF.",

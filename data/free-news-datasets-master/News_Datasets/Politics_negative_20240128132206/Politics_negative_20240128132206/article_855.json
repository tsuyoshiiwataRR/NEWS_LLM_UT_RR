    "text": "Metros With the Most Music Festivals Within a One-Hour Drive Fifty-odd years ago, Michael Lang, Artie Kornfeld, Joel Rosenman, and John P. Roberts put on what has come to be arguably the best-known music festival of all time: the Woodstock Music and Art Fair. Advertised as three days of peace and music, the event attracted some 400,000 attendees (twice the expected 200,000 maximum) who were entertained by 32 acts. While Woodstock certainly wasn't the [first music festival](https://loudwire.com/what-was-first-music-festival/) to be held in the U.S., it changed the course of the industry from community-run and just-for-fun to commercial and competitive. READ MORE: [What Was The First Music Festival?](https://loudwire.com/what-was-first-music-festival/) From Bethel to Major Cities Across the States About 32 million Americans attend music festivals each year, according to [Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/culture/events/music-festival-statistics-graphic-6539009/). Almost half of these are millennials, who place a lot of value on experiences and travel. Organizers, recognizing the generation's priorities and massive spending power, have started making their events not just parties but destinations. Rather than running festivals in rural areas like Bethel, New York, many of the country's biggest events are now held within a few hours of the biggest cities. Roadtrip for the Best Music In light of that, [Vivid Seats](https://www.vividseats.com/) compiled data on which metros are the closest to the most music events. More than 500 U.S. music festivals in 2023 were considered that have the highest ticket sales on Vivid Seats or are among the events that have the highest past attendance. Metros are ranked by the most music festivals within a one-hour drive. Any ties were broken by festivals within a four-hour drive. Drive times were acquired from the location platform [Here](https://www.here.com/). Read on to see where your home base should be if you plan to hit up a festival or two this year. Metros With the Most Music Festivals Within a One-Hour Drive [Vivid Seats](https://www.vividseats.com/)compiled a list of the top 10 major metros with the best music festival access.

    "text": "by Frank Bergman, [Slay News](https://slaynews.com/news/wef-member-reducing-human-population-90-percent-achieve-net-zero/): A World Economic Forum (WEF) member has touted a shocking suggestion for meeting the globalist organization’s “Net Zero” targets. English primatologist and anthropologist Jane Goodall, who the WEF lists as one of its “ [agenda contributors](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/authors/jane-goodall),” told her fellow globalists that they could “save the planet” from “global warming” if the Earth’s population was 90 percent smaller than it is today. TRUTH LIVES on at [https://sgtreport.tv/](https://sgtreport.tv/) Goodall argues that all of the WEF’s “problems” would be solved if fewer humans were walking the Earth. She made the statement during a panel discussion at the organization’s annual summit in Davos, Switzerland. The panel was discussing plans for achieving “Net Zero” to comply with the targets for “Agenda 2030” as dictated by the WEF and its fellow unelected globalist organization – the United Nations. Goodall’s comments have gathered renewed attention after a clip of her statement at the summit was recently shared on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/DiedSuddenly_/status/1707944863000314249). During the panel discussion, participants were discussing the hurdles they face with ushering in the WEF’s agenda to a non-compliant public. They complained about the pushback to unpopular policies for fighting “climate change” and ending capitalism. Goodhall then bemoaned the size of the world’s human population, suggesting that Earth would be better with far fewer people on it. “We cannot hide away from human population growth,” she told frustrated elites. “Because it underlies so many of the other problems,” she continued. “All of these problems that we talk about wouldn’t be a problem if there was the size of the population that it was 500 years ago.” WATCH: In 2023, Earth’s human population is [estimated](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/#:~:text=8%20Billion%20(2022),8%20billion%20in%20October%202023.) to be 8 billion people. 500 years ago, as Goodall, a renowned anthropologist, would know, the population of humans was [approximately 435 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimates_of_historical_world_population). To satisfy Goodall’s suggestion to solve globalists’ “problems,” 90% of humanity would need to go. Of course, WEF-sponsored “fact-checkers” will scramble to tell you that directly quoting Goodall’s comments is “misinformation” and you shouldn’t believe your lying ears.",

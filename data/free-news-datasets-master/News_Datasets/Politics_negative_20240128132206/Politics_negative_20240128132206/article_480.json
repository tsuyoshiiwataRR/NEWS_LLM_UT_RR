    "text": "Once Upon Two Times Movie Review: Family Drama About Estranged Exes Is Absorbing The Hindi drama about the meeting of two families in marriage takes an unexpected turn in this Zee5 feature by Sonakshi Mittal. Once Upon Two Times Movie Review: Family Drama About Estranged Exes Is Absorbing About Once Upon Two Times Sonakshi Mittal's directorial debut, Once Upon Two Times, begins with the romance of two college classmates Ahaan (Anud Singh Dhaka) and Ruhi (Kashish Khan). After they decide to tie the knot, it's time for the families to meet, except there's a hitch. Their parents already know one another and didn't part on good terms. In fact, Ruhi's mother Purnima (Mrinal Kulkarni) was the ex-girlfriend of Ahaan's dad Kaushik (Sanjay Suri). These revelations all tumble out during a family get-together when the connections are unveiled and the older pair wonders about their past and their children's future. The Zee5 film also features the late Nitesh Pandey. Produced by Shashi Mittai, Sumeet Mittai and Ajay Rai, Once Upon Two Times is also written by Sonakshi Mittal. The family drama weaves into a bit of comedy once the secrets are all out in the open. But mostly the Hindi film looks at the issues of commitment and fidelity as it ties into the institution of marriage. Janhit Mein Jaari actor Dhaka and Khan play the central couple, but it is the older generation that draws in our interest. The dynamics of the elders and youngsters are intriguing as they try to work a way forward. Incidentally, this plotline was also seen in the 2022 Bengali film Kishmish and in an episode of the second season of Amazon Prime Video's Made In Heaven. Real-life couple Samir Soni and his wife Neelam played the older pair who had had a romance and now their children were set to be wed.

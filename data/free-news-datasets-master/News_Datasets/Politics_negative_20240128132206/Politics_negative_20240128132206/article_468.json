Savanah Nicole Soto, 18, and her boyfriend, Matthew Guerra, 22, were both reported missing last week before they were [found dead in Guerra's car](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/savanah-nicole-soto-texas-pregnant-teen-death-family-speaks-out/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17) on Tuesday, family members said. Police said each of the victims had a gunshot wound. The couple disappeared a day before Soto, who was 9 months pregnant, was scheduled to be in induced to give birth.

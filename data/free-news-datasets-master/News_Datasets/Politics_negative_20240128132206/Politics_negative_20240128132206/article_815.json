    "text": "Jorge Sanchez\nUpon assuming the presidency of the\nUnited States, Joe Biden promised to improve the country’s immigration policy, which was harshly criticized during the administration of his predecessor, Donald Trump. Initially, this promise was received with joy by the Latin American immigrant community. However, the Biden administration has been forced to reverse his position due to an unchecked immigration crisis.\nThe “open door” policy resulted in a steady increase in immigrants into US territory. Although some officials recognized this problem, many feared losing political support by addressing it. The mayor of\nNew York was one of the first to warn about the lack of resources to care for a large number of immigrants.\nTo address the situation, the Biden administration took steps, such as negotiating with the Mexican government and collaborating with Spain to accept Latin American migrants from centers in the region. However, these actions generated discontent among the Spanish.\nThe\nUnited States House of Representatives, with a Republican majority, has approved a bill to reactivate the construction of a wall on the border with Mexico, an emblematic measure of the Trump era. In contrast, the Senate, with a Democratic majority, announced its intention to block this project, reflecting the division in Congress over immigration policy.\nThe governor of Texas, a state bordering Mexico, has deployed the National Guard to intercept immigrants at the border, managing to block some 30,000 Latin American migrants. However, it is recognized that the solution to the problem requires a coordinated approach at the state level.\nFurthermore, the increase in the arrival of immigrants has generated growth in anti-immigrant sentiments, reflected in crimes and violent acts. Organizations such as the League of United Latino American Citizens (LULAC) have demanded independent investigations into cases of harassment and deaths of immigrants in the country.\nRead more: The grandmother has notified the police. Follow the uncle-in-law. Mistreated her 12-year-old granddaughter until she was pregnant - gave birth to a child.\nIn short, the\nUnited States is currently fighting an immigration threat and trying to restore tranquility in the country. Although it is unclear who will emerge victorious in this fight, it is clear that immigrants’ desires are clashing with American interests. It is hoped that, once the situation normalizes, the United States can regain its reputation as a welcoming country and find sustainable solutions to manage migration flows.\nHere are some actions the US government could consider to address the migration crisis:\n- International cooperation:\n- Work closely with countries of origin and transit to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence and lack of economic opportunity.\n- Reform of the immigration system:\n- Pursue comprehensive reform of the immigration system that addresses deficiencies and provides legal and efficient pathways for immigration.\n- Efficient processing of asylum applications:\n- Strengthen and accelerate asylum application procedures to ensure fair and rapid evaluation of applications.\n- Additional Resources:\n- Allocate additional resources to improve detention and processing facilities, as well as to hire more immigration judges and trained staff.\n- Economic development programs:\n- Implement economic development programs in vulnerable areas to address the economic causes of migration and improve living conditions.\n- Education and outreach:\n- Carry out education and outreach campaigns in countries of origin to inform people about the risks and consequences of irregular migration.\n- Improved border security:\n- Invest in technologies and strategies that improve border security and facilitate the detection of illegal activities.\n- Bipartisan collaboration:\n- Foster bipartisan collaboration to achieve lasting and sustainable legislative solutions.\n- Support to humanitarian organizations:\n- Collaborate with non-governmental organizations and international agencies to provide humanitarian assistance and basic services to migrants.\n- Regional policies:\n- Develop policies that comprehensively address migration across the region, rather than unilateral approaches.\nRead more: Marseille, Nice, Monaco, Cannes, Le Cannet ... This is what awaits them for the 32nd finals of the Coupe de France\nIt is important to note that addressing the migration crisis requires a comprehensive and long-term strategy, in addition to collaboration between various sectors and levels of government, both nationally and internationally. Solutions must balance border security with respect for human rights and address the underlying causes of migration.\nJorge Carlos Sánchez Pérez. Born in Argentina in 1995, I loved this wonderful country. Lover of journalism, culture and communication. I really like writing about\npolitics and international relations. He studied at the Faculty of Psychology and Social Sciences (Sociology) at the University of Flores in Argentina. Out of pity he was expelled. After losing the chance to graduate, he was looking for different types of work in Buenos Aires. My career in journalism began on Telegram channel La Jirafa, as a general information editor. Today I am the main journalist of Telegram channel La Jirafa. My professional experience began at Impacto España Noticias where the editorial team created my capabilities. I currently collaborate with Digital Alert, Aporrea, Rebellion, Spain News, Third Information.\nI’m ready to improve my writing skills. I approach each challenge with an analytical and comprehensive view, with energy and creativity.",

    "text": "By Nivedita Balu\nDec 28 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index ended lower on Thursday, pressured by declining commodity prices that hurt energy and materials stocks.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index .GSPTSE was down 86.53 points, or 0.41%, at 20,929.38.\nThe energy sector .SPTTEN shed 1.4%, hurt by a decline of over $2 in crude prices as concerns eased about shipping disruptions along the Red Sea route. O/R\nThe materials sector .GSPTTMT, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, fell 1.4% as gold prices eased and silver fell due to an uptick in the U.S. dollar. GOL/\n\"There's a greater sensitivity to commodity prices in Canada versus the United States. The TSX is underweight in information technology, communication, healthcare and consumer discretionary,\" said Brandon Michael, senior investment analyst at ABC Funds.\n\"The global indices are continuing to lift higher... it's not the same story for the TSX.\"\nWeighing on the energy index, Energy FuelsEFR.TO tumbled 7% to the bottom of TSX after the minerals company announced that the chief financial officer Tom Brock would step down.\nOther gold stocks including Torex Gold TXG.TO, Seabridge Gold SEA.TO, New Gold NGD.TO were among top losers on the index.\nInvestors locked in profits from a rally ahead of year-end as Friday marks the last trading day of the year, with the TSX expected to post a yearly win.\nTop gainer healthcare index .GSPTTHC added 2.7%, following a 8% jump in cannabis company Tilray Brand TLRY.TO shares, extending gains from the previous session.\nShares of Shopify SHOP.TO jumped 1% and were set to close the year with one of the highest gains on the exchange. The information technology .SPTTTK ended higher and is on track to be the best-performing sector, up over 50% year-to-date.\n(Reporting by Khushi Singh in Bengaluru and Nivedita Balu in Toronto; Editing by Ravi Prakash Kumar and Alistair Bell)\n(( ;))\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

    "text": "After the impact generated by the presentation of Javier Milei's omnibus bill, which foresees profound reforms not only in the economic but also in the criminal and electoral spheres, Congress is beginning to stretch and forces the ruling party to move forward in the formation of the commissions through which the proposal will pass.\nAccording to what was conveyed by the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Martin Menem, the intention is that in the next few hours the names of the members of the commissions that will intervene in the treatment of the project will be defined, with the intention of starting work on the main issues next week, already with the presence of government officials.\nThe intention of La Libertad Avanza is that the \"Law of Bases and Starting Points for the Freedom of Argentines\", a mega project of 664 articles and 183 pages, passes through only 4 commissions: Budget, General Legislation, Constitutional Affairs and Foreign Relations.\nBut Kirchnerism has already warned that the proposal should at least circulate through some 25 of the 46 commissions in the lower house. Meanwhile, other opposition deputies estimated that it could be limited to a dozen.\nFor the time being, only some of the government commissions have been revealed. Liberal José Luis Espert is the nominee to chair the Budget Committee, while Fernando Iglesias (PRO) is nominated for Foreign Affairs. For the commissions of General Legislation and Constitutional Affairs, the candidate is the libertarian Nicolás Mayoraz.\nIn the last few hours, the decision of the ruling party to move forward in the formation of the Impeachment Trial, another of the commissions requested by La Libertad Avanza, also transcended, although in these extraordinary meetings there are no issues related to that area.\nThe omnibus bill that the president sent to Congress on Wednesday generates tensions not only because of the commissions to which it should be referred, but also because of the intention of the ruling party to begin dealing with it in the chamber on January 25.\nIn this sense, different voices of the opposition have already warned the ruling party that it is impossible to deal with the entire package by that date and asked the government to define the priorities to be dealt with in this extraordinary period, which began on December 27 and will last until January 31.\n\"I think the priorities today are to solve the economic situation. We will work to discuss the issues in depth. The president has to set priorities because the law is very comprehensive and the economic situation is critical,\" said Paula Olivetto of the Civic Coalition.\nIn addition, there are issues that began to generate laughter in the opposition, such as the delegation of extraordinary powers to the Executive , something that Alberto Fernández had also requested at the time and failed in his attempt.\nKarina Banfi, for example, warned that radicalism \"has always been opposed to superpowers and delegating powers from Congress to the executive.\" \"You can't legislate blindly, each proposal must guarantee improvements for retirees, workers and/or businessmen and defend minorities who should have representation in Congress,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, the PRO deputies, who in the bloc meeting on Wednesday resolved to divide the project into topics to be analyzed over the weekend, will meet again next week with a clearer idea of the measures that were included in the mega project. In principle, the bench chaired by Cristian Ritondo ratified their intention to accompany, make contributions and improvements to the proposal .\nBeyond the government's predicament, the proposal has a long way to go in the legislative process and some important stumbling blocks since several of the issues that were included in the package require absolute majorities, such as political reforms and those measures that affect co-participative resources.\nAfter formalizing its entry into the Chamber of Deputies, the commissions must be turned over , which, possibly, will have to meet in a plenary session to rule and thus be enabled for the project to be dealt with in the chamber. It is worth clarifying that on occasions and in emergency situations a project can be dealt with \"on a table\" in the chamber without having previously passed through the commissions, for which special majorities are also required, two-thirds of those present.\nHowever, if the bill obtains an opinion, it must be dealt with in the chamber first by a vote in general and then in particular on each article. Given that the initiative includes a far-reaching electoral reform and for those measures in the vote in particular, a special majority of 129 deputies is needed.\nAfter approval by the lower house, the bill will have to be sent to the Senate for review. In the Upper House, the proposal must also make the same route from Deputies through committees that will have to issue dispatch and then take it to the floor.\nIn this case, it transpired that Vice President Victoria Villarruel authorized 7 commissions to study the project . These are Constitutional Affairs, General Legislation, Budget, Agreements, Foreign Affairs, Justice, and Administrative and Municipal Affairs.\nFor the time being, it has been reported that the Budget Commission will be chaired by Ezequiel Atauche, the Justice Commission by Carlos Pagotto and the Constitutional Affairs Committee by the Peronist non-K, Edgardo Kueider. Meanwhile, General Legislation will be in charge of Bartolomé Abdala and Foreign Affairs will be in charge of Francisco Paoltroni.\nAfter issuing an opinion, the Senate takes a week to deal with it on the floor, where the proposal will be put to a vote in general and then in particular on each article. If the law is modified, it must return to the Chamber of Deputies for ratification.\nOf the package of laws included in the mega bill, the articles that require an absolute majority are electoral laws, those related to political parties and some tax articles that affect co-participatory resources.",

    "text": "|Users Online Now: 2,070 (|\nPage 1\nPrevious Page\nNext Page\nBiden-Harris Regime Mum About the Infectious Diseases Tracked Back Into the US by Illegal Aliens. polio syph TB Leprosy\nOver 6.85 million illegal aliens have stolen into the U.S. since President Joe Biden took office. More have entered undetected. This ongoing incursion, largely by single adults, comes at a hefty price.\nWhile numerical values can be assigned to the cost of illegal immigration — an estimated $451 billion annually just to house the migrants who've entered under Biden's watch and another $3 billion in federal welfare benefits for every million parolees released into the U.S. — it can also be observed under microscopes, in hospital waiting rooms, and occasionally in morgues.\nDiseases once thought eradicated or controlled in the U.S. have made a comeback, in part due to the influx of illegal aliens from a growing list of countries in recent years.\nLeprosy and polio\n\"The recent polio and leprosy cases are almost certainly imports to the U.S.,\" Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a physician and scientist at Stanford University, told RealClearInvestigations.\nLeprosy was long a rarity in the U.S., with most cases affecting travelers to distant countries with high rates of the disease, reported CNN. The World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory data shows that in 2022, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Brazil led the world in leprosy cases.\nNow this likely import may be endemic in Florida.\nPolio, a debilitating and potentially deadly disease, turned up in New York last year. America hadn't seen a case in over a decade, largely because the supermajority of American citizens are vaccinated against the virus during childhood. The New York State Department of Health indicated the unnamed Rockland County resident, left paralyzed by the disease, caught the virus \"in a location outside of the U.S..\"\nNot only did polio hitch a ride back into the country, it made its way into the water supply.\nIn August 2022, New York City health authorities indicated that they found polio circulating in the city's wastewater after Rockland and Orange Counties had similarly announced the once-eradicated virus had been found in wastewater samples, reported the New York Times.\nNew York City Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan warned in a damning April 11 letter that around 50% of the migrants pouring into the sanctuary city were not vaccinated against the poliovirus.\nWhereas legal migrants and travelers must be vaccinated to enter the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that neither so-called refugees nor aslyees are required to meet vaccination requirements before coming to the United States.\nRealClearInvestigations reported that the Biden administration, otherwise gung ho about foisting novel vaccinations on the public, admitted to lacking vaccination records for the millions of illegal aliens who've entered the country since January 2021.\nChicken pox, tuberculosis, and syphilis\nNYC Health Commissioner Vasan indicated in his April letter that extra to a glaring polio vulnerability among illegal aliens and a breakout of chicken pox — a problem similarly observed this month in migrant shelters by the Chicago Department of Public Health — there was also cause for concern because many mirants \"lived in or traveled through countries with high rates of [tuberculosis].\"\n[\nLast Edited by\nCoastie Patriot\nSIC SEMPER TYRRANIS\nTHE SAME PEOPLE WHO SAID NO GUNS BECAUSE OF POLICE NOW WANT TO DEFUND THE POLICE!!!!\nDr Thaddeus They\nThey don't really care whether the truth gets out, because the public no longer knows what's meant by \"the truth.\"\nWell, I mean, no one can tell the difference anymore between what's real and what's fake.\nAnyway, the point is, I can tell you all of this, right out in the open, because it doesn't matter who knows about it. They won't know whether to believe it or not.-\nX Files: Lost art of Forehead Sweat\nA gun is a tool, Marion, no better or no worse than any other tool, an axe, a shovel or anything. A gun is as good or as bad as the man using it. Remember that.\n-SHANE-\nJefferson Smith: You see, boys forget what their country means by just reading The Land of the Free in history books. Then they get to be men they forget even more. Liberty's too precious a thing to be buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men should hold it up in front of them every single day of their lives and say: I'm free to think and to speak. My ancestors couldn't, I can, and my children will. Boys ought to grow up remembering that . - MR Smith Goes To Washington-\nto grow up remembering th\nMy oath to support and defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic has no expiration date!!!\nTen Bears : It's sad that governments are chiefed by the double tongues. There is iron in your words of death for all Comanche to see and so there is iron in your words of life. No signed paper can hold the iron. It must come from men.

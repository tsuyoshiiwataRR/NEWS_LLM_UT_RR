    "text": "Allison Gill's Thursday podcast, \"The Daily Beans,\" addresses the Colorado 14th Amendment lawsuit and the impending case before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nSpeaking to former Homeland Security adviser to Mike Pence, Olivia Troye, Gill explained that\nif the Supreme Court doesn't weigh in on the case in time, the Colorado Supreme Court said that Donald Trump must appear on the ballot anyway, despite its ruling. However, the Colorado GOP said that they would withdraw from all primary elections entirely and go to a primary caucus if Trump is banned from the ballot.\nThe case is being watched closely as Maine is trying to decide whether Trump qualifies for its ballot as well,\nas Lawfare's Roger Parloff explained this week in a social media thread. The secretary of state there could use the ruling of the Colorado state Supreme Court to justify not putting Trump on its ballot. There's currently no litigation in the state, but if the top election official there decides to remove Trump from the ballot, there likely will be.\nGill noted that the Colorado decision may be dealing with the primary, but it also\nhas a bearing on the general election ballot. So, if the S upreme Court misses the Jan. 5 deadline for the ballot cutoff, it doesn't mean that the case somehow disappears.\nGill told\nRaw Story via direct message that there are 16 states to watch on the matter.\nDuring the podcast, she explained that there are some debates over whether the 14th Amendment is about someone running for office or taking office. Another legal debate includes questioning whether the presidency is considered to officially be a constitutional office.\nTroye cited more moderate Republicans who are using the excuse that the litigation is taking away the will of the voters. They want to ignore the 14th Amendment entirely and hand it over to the voters.\nALSO READ:\nTrump’s Iowa Faith Leader Coalition includes bigots, advocate of killing Obama\n\"I look at the Supreme Court and I don't know what they'll do,\" she confessed. \"What I am concerned about is that it seems like bad things somehow help the Trump campaign. He did something bad, these are things that potentially keep him off the ballot. And some are like, this is a step in the right direction, hopefully. Anything to keep him out of the Oval Office. I'm always in favor of that because I don't think he should be anywhere near the Oval Office.\"\nTroye explained that on the flip side, it \"galvanizes\" the Trump campaign.\n\"And I just hate the fact that they're — I mean I'm already seeing the talking points. I'm really curious to see how much they've fundraised off of that. They've sent out an email on it already. I just wonder how this plays out in the general public,\" she continued. \"Not that we should fear that in the judicial process, because justice should be justice. And there is something here to be said about let's look at the Constitution and really make a ruling on this.\"",

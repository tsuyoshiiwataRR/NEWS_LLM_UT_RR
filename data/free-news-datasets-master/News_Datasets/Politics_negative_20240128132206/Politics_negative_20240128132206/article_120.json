    "text": "Re “Christmas in Crony Capitalism” (Dec. 24):\nSeldom, if ever, do I agree with columnist Susan Shelley on anything.\nThus, I was shocked to agree with her 100% on the subject of the proposed high speed rail project from Rancho Cucamonga to Las Vegas. The taxpayers would be much better served by tying the $3 billion up with a red ribbon and giving it to Mr. Edens as a Christmas present, in exchange for his promise to stop right now and go no further. Otherwise, the bleeding will never stop.\n— Noel Park, Rancho Palos Verdes\nGreenhut is right about the Delta plan and water policy\nAbout 40 years ago, I stayed with a family in Puebla, Mexico as part of a Spanish language program.\nEvery day when I brushed my teeth, their 6 year-old-boy would hop up on the bathroom sink and monitor my water consumption by turning off the water “in between spits.”\nTo this day, I turn off and on the water when brushing and have become much more conscious of my water usage in general.\nIn his recent column, “Hate it or not, the Delta tunnel is badly needed” (Dec. 24) Steven Greenhut makes some salient points and despite being a self-declared environmentalist, I concur with his position\nHowever, I do have a question: why is there rarely (here or otherwise) any mention of individual conservation?\nWhy shouldn’t our water bills have a sliding rate based on consumption?\nIf we don’t balance the scale of supply and demand, there will always be future problems.\n— Jill Watkins, Laguna Beach\nHealthcare is in trouble with the new arrivals\nIf not already, America is starting the new year a mockery. Our crumbling sickcare system will be inundated with hundreds of thousands of immigrants regardless of status.\nPeople who, as the Dec.17 article on Medi-Cal expansion states, are sicker and die younger. I work in healthcare. I am dreading the new year due to the number of “urgent” Medi-Cal referrals I am seeing. These new patients will require far greater resources stretching beyond the limits our very overburdened and broken system. So much for us established patrons/citizens getting decent care.\n— Frances O’Neil, Santa Ana",

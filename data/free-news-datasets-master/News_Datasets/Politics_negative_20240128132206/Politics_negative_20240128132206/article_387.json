    "text": "Sir Keir has described outgoing First Minister for Wales Mark Drakeford as a ‘titan’ – PA/Joe Giddens\nLabour’s record in Wales shows Sir Keir Starmer would wreck the British economy and be forced to hike taxes, the Welsh Secretary has warned.\nDavid TC Davies blamed the “reckless policies” of the Left-wing administration in Cardiff for economic “stagnation” and a crumbling health system.\nWriting for The Telegraph (see below), he said Welsh voters and businesses had to suffer higher taxes and worse public services than counterparts in England.\nHe warned that Sir Keir, who has described outgoing First Minister Mark Drakeford as a “titan”, would use Wales as a “blueprint” for the whole UK.\nTory strategists have identified Labour’s record in Wales as a major Achilles’ heel for Sir Keir and plan to attack it relentlessly in the run-up to the election.\nThey believe that zeroing in on Cardiff’s incompetence will show voters that the Labour leader can not be trusted with the reins of power in London.\nMr Drakeford will leave a controversial legacy after five years in office, with the NHS in crisis and anger over the botched rollout of 20mph speed limits.\nDavid TC Davies: ‘If you want to know what UK Labour would do to the economy and health service – look no further than the damage their partners have carried out in Wales’ – Matthew Horwood/Getty\nHe was forced to admit this week that his administration made mistakes in launching the 20mph law, which polls have shown is hugely unpopular.\n“Despite Welsh Labour’s shocking legacy, Sir Keir Starmer seems to be on a different planet, choosing instead to describe the Welsh Government’s actions as a ‘blueprint’ for the rest of the UK,” Mr Davies wrote.\n“I challenge Sir Keir Starmer to repeat this description to my constituents, who are all suffering every single day from cuts to health provision.\n“As a result of the implemented policies the Welsh economy is stagnating again, with wages and the employment rate lagging behind other parts of the UK, with Welsh businesses also paying the highest levels of business rates in the UK.\n“If you want to know what UK Labour would do to the economy and health service – look no further than the damage their partners have carried out in Wales.”\nThe Welsh Government, whose finances are in chaos, has hiked business rates and cut levels of relief in a move that has dismayed hospitality firms.\nWales also recently recorded its worst-ever performance for reading, maths and science results, according to the international Pisa rankings.\nIn contrast, England is now among the best performers across all Western countries, having made huge improvements in recent years.\n‘Failing the people of Wales’ Mr Davies added: “There’s no two ways about it. Labour is failing the people of Wales, despite receiving a record £18 billion a year – the largest block grant since devolution began over two decades ago – from the UK Government.\n“Does Labour’s track record sound like something to be proud of? It certainly doesn’t. But, unfortunately, Labour’s policies will be felt – and remembered – for many years to come.”\nHe warned that those jostling to replace the outgoing First Minister had “chosen not to stand up to his reckless policies” and would make things “100 times worse”.\nMr Drakeford announced his long-anticipated resignation earlier this month, sparking a fierce competition within Welsh Labour to become his successor.\nIn a tribute, Sir Keir described him as “a true titan of Welsh and Labour politics” and said he had “delivered for Wales with steely determination and quiet authority”.\nHe also praised the outgoing First Minister last March, describing his record in power as a “blueprint for what Labour can do across the UK”.\nSir Keir is on a different planet if he thinks Wales is a ‘blueprint’ for UK Imagine a nation where more than half-a-million people are languishing on never-ending waiting lists.\nOr where industrial fans are running every hour of the day to desperately dispel diesel fumes pumped out of stationary ambulances that cannot offload critically ill patients, due to a lack of hospital beds.\nThis nation will also never again have any new roads built and its education standards – English, maths and science – continue to wallow after way over a decade at the bottom of Pisa’s heap.\nThis isn’t a place of fiction – welcome to Labour-run Wales.\nLabour has been responsible for running Wales since 1999 and since then has been controlling health, council oversight, education, transport, environment, including water quality, and other areas.\nHundreds of millions of pounds have been wasted by multiple first ministers.\nBut perhaps the most notorious period was within the last five years.\nUnder Mark Drakeford’s watch, Wales has more than 500,000 patients – almost one in five people in Wales – languishing on a waiting list, as well as over 27,000 people awaiting treatment for more than two years.\nLabour ministers scuppered all attempts to hold to account their actions in the pandemic, where Wales recorded the biggest loss of life, by blocking an independent Covid-19 inquiry.\nIn transport, Labour imposed – at a cost of £33 million – a blanket 20mph speed limit that will hit the Welsh economy by over £4 billion, as well as blocking new roads from being built ever again.\nLabour also wanted to pay £1,600 every single month to some asylum seekers – before I blocked it.\nAnd, to top off the list of insults, Labour wants to go on a lavish spending spree to the tune of £120 million of taxpayers’ money to create dozens of new politicians – despite ordering health boards to make over £60 million in drastic cuts.\nBluntly, if you have money to create politicians then you can help hospitals. It’s all about priorities.\nBut despite Welsh Labour’s shocking legacy, Sir Keir Starmer seems to be on a different planet, choosing instead to describe the Welsh Government’s actions as a “blueprint” for the rest of the UK.\nSir Keir went further this month, describing Mark Drakeford as a “titan”.\nI challenge Sir Keir Starmer to repeat this description to my constituents, who are all suffering every single day from cuts to health provision.\nIf you want to know what UK Labour would do to the economy and health service – look no further than the damage their partners have carried out in Wales.\nAnd if you thought life in Wales may now improve, you need to think again because things are about to become 100 times worse, not better.\nAll those who are set to replace the outgoing First Minister were joined to him at the hip and chose not to stand up to the reckless policies I’ve outlined above.\nAs a result of the implemented policies the Welsh economy is stagnating again, with wages and the employment rate lagging behind other parts of the UK, with Welsh businesses also paying the highest levels of business rates in the UK.\nOn top of that, Wales has yet again finished bottom of all the UK nations in the 2022 Pisa rankings, while the number of teachers employed continues to fall.\nThere’s no two ways about it, Labour is failing the people of Wales, despite receiving a record £18 billion a year – the largest block grant since devolution began over two decades ago – from the UK.\nDoes Labour’s track record sound like something to be proud of? It certainly doesn’t. But, unfortunately, Labour’s policies will be felt – and remembered – for many years to come.\nDavid TC Davies is MP for Monmouth and Secretary of State for Wales\n%n\nDiscover Telegraph Wine Cellar’s new wine club.

    "text": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) said Thursday the houses of both her daughters were swatted. “Both my daughter’s houses just got swatted today. Big thanks to the police who responded! We appreciate you and support you! Whoever is doing this, you are going to get caught and it won’t be funny to you anymore,” Greene said. Both my daughter’s houses just got swatted today. Big thanks to the police who responded! We appreciate you and support you! Whoever is doing this, you are going to get caught and it won’t be funny to you anymore. [@FBI] — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene🇺🇸 (@RepMTG) [December 28, 2023] [Greene](https://100percentfedup.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-swatted-on-christmas-day/) said her home was swatted for the 8th time on Christmas day. “I was just swatted. This is like the 8th time. On Christmas with my family here. My local police are the GREATEST and shouldn’t have to deal with this. I appreciate them so much and my family and I are in joyous spirits celebrating the birth of our savior Jesus Christ!” Greene commented. I was just swatted. This is like the 8th time.

Marjorie Taylor Greene🇺🇸 (@RepMTG) [December 25, 2023] “I was swatted this morning on Christmas Day and a few days ago – Thursday Dec 21st. we received this death threat where this man is saying I will be shot in the head and skinned to make a ‘parasol’ making a reference to Gein, who was a psychopath killer who would make things out of his victim’s skin. He also says he would like to smash Pres Trump’s and Brian’s heads on a curb,” Greene later said.

Marjorie Taylor Greene🇺🇸 (@RepMTG) [December 25, 2023] X users reacted to the news of Greene’s daughters being a swatting target: Swatting of conservatives will stop the moment when the FBI ceases being preoccupied with pursuing parents at school board meetings, Christians, pro-Lifers, and current regime political opponents and they will allocate their time and resources to finding those who abuse law… [https://t.co/OiRiLXwNhX] — I Meme Therefore I Am 🇺🇸 (@ImMeme0) [December 28, 2023] This is so dangerous. Now they're going after her kids? [https://t.co/QAq37iK8xt] — Wendy Patterson (@wendyp4545) [December 28, 2023] Why is the FBI continuing to allow this to happen to a member of the House of Representatives? Is it because she’s a Republican that Biden’s administration isn’t doing anything about these attempted murders on MTG and her family? Shame on you FBI. You stink! — Paul A. Szypula 🇺🇸 (@Bubblebathgirl) [December 28, 2023] [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/12/25/marjorie-taylor-greene-reports-swatting-at-her-house-on-christmas/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=forbes&utm_term=se-breaking&sh=13d1fcacb8b5) reports: Greene has been swatted in the past, including at least twice in August 2022, and posted on X in October 2022 that she had been swatted for “the 6th time.” In that post, Greene called swatting “a very serious crime (in which) the caller wants to have their victim murdered by police,” and said it is “a giant abuse of police resources and time.” Swatting is rare, but it has occasionally resulted in death if police mount a large-scale response to a fake criminal call. Rep. [Brandon Williams](https://100percentfedup.com/another-gop-member-of-congress-swatted-on-christmas-day/) (R-NY) and Human Events Senior Editor [Jack Posobiec](https://100percentfedup.com/jack-posobiec-says-his-family-was-swatted-on-christmas-day/) have also been victims of recent swatting incidents.",

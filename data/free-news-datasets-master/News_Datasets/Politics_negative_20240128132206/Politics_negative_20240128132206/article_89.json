    "text": "The Broncos made a major move following a brutal home loss to the Patriots, benching star QB Russell Wilson in favor of Jarett Stidham. The former Auburn QB has only made two previous starts in 2022 for the Raiders, and went 0-2.\nStidham and the Broncos are still favored at home on Sunday ( -3.5 on bet365 ) against the Chargers, who have lost three consecutive games. The Broncos beat Los Angeles 24-7 on the road on December 10th.\nElsewhere in the NFL, the struggling Chiefs will have a chance at home to score a key win ( -7 vs. Cincinnati ), the surging Browns ( -7.5 vs. the Jets ) host Thursday Night Football, and the Lions and Cowboys clash on Saturday night ( Dallas -5.5 vs. Detroit ) will play a must-watch triple-header on Christmas Day.\nBet $5 and get $150 in bonus bets or get a first bet safety net up to $1,000 on bet365 .\nThe NFL Wires staff will be providing their picks against the spread throughout the season on Broncos Wire.

    "text": "AUSTIN — If Texas enforces its new sweeping immigration law that allows state and local police to arrest migrants, President Joe Biden’s administration will sue the state, according to a letter the Justice Department sent to Gov. Greg Abbott. The letter, obtained by The Dallas Morning News , was sent Thursday morning to Abbott and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The letter states that the new law — known as Senate Bill 4 — is unconstitutional.\nAdvertisement Related: What to know about Texas’ new immigration law Advertisement “Accordingly, the United States intends to file suit to enjoin the enforcement of SB 4 unless Texas agrees to refrain from enforcing the law,” wrote Brian Boynton, principal deputy assistant attorney general.

    "text": "I am writing in response to a letter about Donald Trump's inability to become President again because of the \"riot\" that took place on Jan. 6, 2021. Speaker of the House at that time, Nancy Pelosi, did not heed warnings about the possibility of large crowds at the Capitol. She should face charges for not protecting this sacred building.\nLook at the timeline: When Trump was President, we had no threats from any foreign powers. We had historically low rates of interest, inflation and unemployment. Since Biden became President, we've had the botched Afghanistan withdrawal, wars in Ukraine and Israel, increasing weakness before our enemies, and depletion of our resources due to open borders.\nBiden's White House has become a place where pride flags are displayed alongside our American flag, and drag queens have parties on the White House lawn.\nBiden, a spineless jellyfish, has compared tragedies in Hawaii, East Palestine, and soldiers' deaths to minor problems experienced in his own life (with embellishment). Biden is supported by people who don't want to be citizens of the United States, yet they stay because they have the \"privilege\" of protesting in our country without fear.\nDonald Trump has shown his love for our country by continuing to fight the baseless charges against him. Our country was safer with Trump as President. The \"disorganized Democrats\" have allowed foreign enemies to establish a foothold in our country. If foolish voters allow Democrats to win the Presidency, we are destined to become \"The Man in the High Castle\" (look up this series). Trump may have a gruff demeanor, but that is what kept us safe from our enemies. Trump has the character of America and is desperately needed to restore our country.\nBryan Fleming\nAshland",

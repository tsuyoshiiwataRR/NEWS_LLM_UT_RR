    "text": "The mortal remains of Vijayakanth were taken to the DMDK office in Koyambedu from his Virugambakkam house in Chennai. Earlier in the day, Chief Minister MK Stalin paid floral tributes to Vijaykanth at his Chennai residence. Calling the latter’s demise a tragedy for Tamil Nadu and the film industry, CM Stalin said that the “news of the DMDK chief’s death brought shock and pain.” The Chief Minister’s Office in a statement said the “DMDK chief will be laid to rest with full state honors.” Actor and Makkal Needhi Maiam President Kamal Haasan extended his condolences after the passing of DMDK chief and actor Vijayakanth on Thursday (28 December 2023). Vijayakanth died in Chennai at age 71 after testing positive for Covid-19 earlier that day. Haasan said “The news of the death of my beloved brother Vijayakanth, the founder of the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazgam party, a unique actor and captain of Tamil cinema, who was loved by all, is deeply saddening. He was a creator of innovative ideas in Tamilnadu politics. Fearless courage was his hallmark.” He added, “Vijayakanth, a revolutionary artist who made his mark in both the fields of cinema and politics, will remain forever in our memories. I offer my heartfelt condolences to all his family, volunteers and fans who are grieving his loss.” AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami also conveyed condolences to Vijayakanth’s bereaved family. “I am deeply saddened to learn that Vijayakanth, President of Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazgam, former Leader of Opposition and dear brother passed away due to ill health. I convey my deepest condolences to the bereaved Premalatha Vijayakanth, Annarath’s wife and DMDK General Secretary, her family and her volunteers. I pray that the soul of Vijayakanth, who has done many active works in public life and the field of art and is affectionately known as Captain by the people, rests in the shade of Lord Thiruvadi,” he said. Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, and BJP state chief K Annamalai, too, condoled the demise of Vijayakanth.",

This is [ reported](https://t.me/AFUStratCom/21884) by Strategic Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, subordinate to the General Staff. Military noted that Russians fired about 900 Iskander-M ballistic missiles and 48 \"Kinzhal\" missiles. They also counted the number of Russian-Iranian \"Shahed\" kamikaze drones, which the occupiers used to attack Ukraine during the year. There are about 3.7 thousand of them.

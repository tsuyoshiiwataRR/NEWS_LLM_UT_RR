    "text": "Ahead of the Christmas weekend, officials in Grundy County erected two digital signs along Interstate 55 that aimed to deter buses carrying migrants from stopping in the county, which recently passed a resolution declaring it a “non-sanctuary county for immigration.” The signs, placed near two northbound exits — one by Dwight and the other by Gardner — read: “NO MIGRANT BUSES THIS EXIT.” They went up Saturday in response to reports of buses dropping migrants in other communities surrounding Chicago, said Grundy County Sheriff Ken Briley. “We wanted to get us through the holiday weekend so we didn’t run into the unfortunate circumstances of having these people dropped in rural Grundy County with no place to go,” Briley said. No buses stopped in the county, he added, and the signs have since been removed, with no plans to put them back. Naperville, Aurora, Fox River Grove, Elmhurst and Cicero are among the communities that have seen busloads of migrants in recent weeks amid mounting calls for a coordinated response from federal and state governments to the influx of migrants, estimated to exceed 25,000, who have come to Chicago since last summer. Four days before Christmas, law enforcement officials in Kankakee said a bus dropped 30 to 40 migrants at a gas station in town around 4:30 a.m. Three hours later, police showed up to find people wrapped in blankets. Some stayed at the gas station, while others were spotted walking on the highway. “The passengers, hailing from Venezuela, were left without money, food, adequate clothing, and were under the impression that they had reached their destination,” read a statement from the Kankakee County sheriff’s office. Briley said he and others in Grundy County, which is southwest of Chicago, heard about the busload of migrants arriving in Kankakee and decided to huddle Saturday morning to craft an emergency plan in case something similar happened in their county. It’s unclear whether anyone from the county notified the Illinois Department of Transportation prior to erecting the digital signs. An IDOT spokesperson said the agency has not posted any signs or message boards regarding migrants or migrant buses, and that the signs were gone when IDOT employees inspected the area Wednesday. Grundy County State’s Attorney Russell Baker, who was at the Saturday morning meeting, said he was not sure whether the agency was told about the signs, or if they were placed on county land that runs along the interstate. “If someone got lost or thought by mistake that this was Chicago, those signs were a directory,” Baker said. “We thought the signs could persuade bus drivers, if lost, to keep going on I-55 to places that are equipped to handle (migrants).” Briley said the emergency plan also called for the county to take stranded migrants, should they end up in Grundy County, to Joliet. There, working in coordination with Joliet police and Will County emergency management, migrants would be directed to trains bound for Chicago. The county’s emergency migrant plan came on the heels of a resolution, passed two weeks ago, that declared Grundy, population nearly 53,000, a “non-sanctuary county for immigration.” The resolution states that the county “pledges and re-dedicates its limited resources to its residents in need: Seniors, families living below the poverty level, veterans, homeless, and all those in need of Social Services already here in Grundy County, legally.” Three years earlier, county leaders put a nonbinding resolution on ballots that asked if authorities should assist the federal government with immigration enforcement. That resolution passed with 64% of the vote. The County Board decided to revisit the topic of immigration this fall after watching a controversy unfold in nearby Joliet, where public backlash forced Joliet Township to withdraw its application seeking an $8.6 million state grant for asylum-seekers. “We felt we had a clear mandate from our voters,” said Grundy County Board Vice Chairman Drew Muffler. “With inflation and everything else, we’re struggling to meet our own budget demands.” Muffler said the County Board could next take up a measure that would allow authorities to impound buses or fine bus companies that unload passengers without permission. Chicago and Aurora are among the communities with similar laws on the books. And if migrants do end up arriving in Grundy County, Muffler said his hope is that the county can divert them elsewhere. “Counties have theoretically prepared for it,” Muffler said. “They’ve said they’re sanctuaries. We’re not.” Here's how each full moon received its name About 2023's full moons 2023 was home to 13 full moons, a function of a roughly 29.5-day lunar cycle fitting into the 365 days it takes for the Earth to rotate around the Sun. That brought the blue moon Aug. 30, the second full moon of a month. Four of the full moons were supermoons: July 3, Aug. 1, Aug. 30 and Sept. 29. During a supermoon, the moon is at its closest distance to the earth. The moon's rotation around the Earth isn't a perfect circle, it's longer on one side than the other. Therefore, the moon is at varying distances to the Earth, depending on the time of year. During supermoons, the moon appears brighter and about 7% bigger than other full moons. The one lunar eclipse, when the full moon drifts into the shadow of the Earth, occured on Oct. 28. Most of the time, the \"full\" moon isn't actually 100% full. Only when the moon, Earth and the sun are exactly aligned is the moon technically 100% full and produces a lunar eclipse. Scroll down to see the names given to each full moon as well as the meaning behind each and more information about the lunar eclipse. The naming information comes from [space.com](http://www.space.com). Dec. 26: Full Cold Moon When: 7:33 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time December is when the winter cold fastens its grip on the Northern Hemisphere. Sometimes this moon is referred to as the Long Nights Moon, and the nights are their longest. The moon is above the horizon a long time. On occasion, this moon was also called the Moon before Yule. This particular full moon makes its highest arc across the sky because it is opposite to the low sun. And on this very same night, another celestial object will also be opposite to the sun: [Mars](https://www.space.com/47-mars-the-red-planet-fourth-planet-from-the-sun.html), which arrives at opposition 87 minutes after the moon turns full. Depending on your location, you will see Mars shining like a brilliant yellow-orange star, either hovering very close below the moon, or you will see the moon actually pass in front of Mars, producing an occultation. 2023 full moons that have already occurred: Jan. 6: Full Wolf Moon When: 6:08 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time Amid the zero-degree cold and deep snows of midwinter, the wolf packs howled hungrily outside villages. It was also known as the Old Moon or the Moon after Yule. In some tribes this was the Full Snow Moon; most applied that name to the next moon. Feb. 5: Full Snow Moon When: 1:29 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time Depending on location, the heaviest snows fall in this month. Much of the Mid-Atlantic falls into this category, as well as the Mid-South. Hunting becomes very difficult during February. Hence, to some tribes, this was the Full Hunger Moon. March 7: Full Worm Moon When: 7:40 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time In this month the ground softens and earthworm casts reappear, inviting the return of the robins. Some more northern tribes knew this as the Full Crow Moon, when the cawing of crows signals the end of winter. It's also known as the Full Crust Moon because the snow cover becomes crusted from thawing by day and freezing at night. April 6: Full Pink Moon When: 12:34 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time The grass pink or wild ground phlox is one of the earliest widespread flowers of the spring. May 5: Full Flower Moon When: 1:34 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time The term full flower moon is derived from how Flowers are abundant everywhere by this time of year. This moon was also known as the Full Corn Planting Moon. June 3: Full Strawberry Moon When: 11:42 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time Strawberry picking season peaks during this month; Europeans called this the Rose Moon. July 3: Full Buck Supermoon When: 7:39 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time Named for when the new antlers of buck deer push out from their foreheads in coatings of velvety fur. It was also often called the Full Thunder Moon, thunderstorms being now most frequent. This will be the first of four consecutive supermoons of the year. Expect a slightly larger and brighter full moon in the sky. Aug. 1: Full Sturgeon Supermoon When: 2:31 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time This moon honors when this large fish of the Great Lakes and other major bodies of water, like Lake Champlain, where they are most readily caught. This is the second of four consecutive full moons of the year. Look for a slightly brighter and larger full moon in the sky. Aug. 30: The Blue Supermoon When: 9:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time The saying \"once in a blue moon\" means a rare occurrence in folklore. However, it predates the current use of the term, which indicates two full moons within a month. \"The term Blue Moon is believed to have originated in 1883 after the eruption of Krakatoa. The volcano put so much dust in the atmosphere that the Moon actually looked blue in color. This was so unusual that the term 'once in a Blue Moon' was coined,\" according to David Williams of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. A blue moon occurs once every 2.5 years, on average. This will also be the third consecutive supermoon of four, and the biggest of them all. The moon will be 222,043 miles away from the Earth, besting the other supermoon from up to 4,000 miles. Still, there won't be a noticeable difference between the Blue Supermoon and the others Sept. 29: Full Harvest Supermoon When: 5:57 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time Traditionally, this name goes to the full moon that occurs closest to the fall equinox, which falls this year on Sept. 22. This year's Harvest Moon comes unusually early. At the peak of the harvest, farmers can work into the night by the light of this moon. Corn, pumpkins, squash, beans, and wild rice — indigenous staples in North America — are now ready for gathering. This will be the last of the four consecutive supermoons of the year. Oct. 28: Full Hunter Blood Moon When: 4:24 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time With the leaves falling and the deer fattened, this is the time to hunt. Since the fields have been reaped, hunters can ride over the stubble, and can more easily see the fox and other animals. This will be the only full moon with a partial lunar eclipse visible to at least part of the United States. Those in New England, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Washington D.C. eastern Virginia and eastern North Carolina will see part of the moon shaded brownish red that evening. You can find start and end times for the eclipse at your location using this [link](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/map/2023-october-28). Nov. 27: Full Beaver Moon When: 4:16 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time At this point of the year, it was time to set beaver traps before the swamps freeze to ensure a supply of warm winter furs. Another interpretation suggests that the name Beaver Moon comes from the fact that the beavers are now active in their preparation for winter.",

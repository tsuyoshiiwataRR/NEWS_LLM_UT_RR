    "text": "A small feat for West Ham and a setback for the Gunners! By winning (0-2) at the Emirates Stadium, Alphonse Areola and his teammates stunned Arsenal on Thursday evening, at the end of the 19th day of the Premier League.\nThe Gunners needed to win to move ahead of Liverpool, take the lead in the league and at the same time distance Manchester City and Unai Emery's Aston Villa. But Mikel Arteta's men lacked realism as evidenced by the statistics of the match: 74.2% possession in their favour, 30 shots including eight on target, compared to only six including three on target for their opponents.\nAgainst them, the West Ham players were able to be opportunistic by scoring at the start of the first half on a counter initiated by former Lyon player Lucas Paqueta and finished by Tomas Soucek (13‚Ä≤). The referees hesitated to validate it, checking if the ball had not gone out to the left of the goal on the pass before the goal but ended up awarding it.\nIn the second half, it was from a corner and thanks to a header from a former Arsenal player, Konstantinos Mavropanos, well helped by the post and the crossbar (55'), that West Ham made the break. The Hammers could even have finished off their opponents with a penalty in the dying seconds, saved by David Raya.\nMavropanos bends Arsenal again! üî¥\nThe former Gunner's header hits the bar and then the post before going into goal and it's 2-0 for West Ham ‚öíÔ∏è #WHUARS | #PremierLeague pic.twitter.com/skos017mBc\n‚Äî CANAL+ Foot (@CanalplusFoot) December 28, 2023\nTottenham end their run at Brighton Having struggled away from home in recent weeks, the Hammers have made a very good move in the race for European qualification. West Ham are in sixth place in the Premier League table thanks to this win and are ahead of Manchester United.\nEarlier in the evening, the other match of this 19th matchday of the Premier League saw Brighton surprise Tottenham in a very fast-paced match (4-2). Spurs, who were on a three-game winning streak, were unable to catch up after two goals from Jack Hinshelwood (11') and Joao Pedro (23' from the penalty spot).\nThey lost all hope after third and fourth goals from Pervis Estupinan (63‚Ä≤) and Joao Pedro (75‚Ä≤, again from the penalty spot), despite the reductions of the score by Alejo Veliz (81‚Ä≤) and Ben Davies (85‚Ä≤). Tottenham are in fifth place in the table.",

    "text": "ANKENY, Iowa — Ron DeSantis railed against \"indoctrination\" in public schools and universities in a round-table discussion Thursday with conservative parents and school board members. DeSantis' battle against \"woke\" ideology has been a central theme throughout his presidential campaign. He reminds Iowa audiences about his leadership of Florida during the COVID-19 pandemic, when he eventually opposed closures and mask mandates, and laws he signed to prohibit instruction on LGBTQ concepts or \"critical race theory\" in Florida schools.\n\"What's happening is, the left is hijacking other institutions in society to try to impose their agenda on the American people,\" DeSantis said, recalling his fight with Disney over one of Florida's controversial education laws.\nIn a one-on-one interview with the Des Moines Register, DeSantis declined to elaborate about what might be motivating Democrats or \"the left\" to teach kids about concepts such as gender ideology.\n\"I don't know what's motivating it, but obviously, I don't think that that's what we want in our education system,\" he said, calling for schools to focus on \"the basics.\"\nWhat is Ron DeSantis' stance on K-12 education? Lawmakers in both Iowa and Florida have focused intensely on education in recent years, with the rise of a \"parents' rights\" movement and conservatives' concerns over inappropriate materials in classrooms.\nReynolds and DeSantis each signed major bills this year to create and expand private school scholarship programs in their state.\nIf elected president, DeSantis said he plans to make private school vouchers available nationwide using corporate tax credits.\n\"It's actually improved all the different types of education,\" DeSantis said of the Florida law. \"Because school districts compete for students … and this has been something that has been very, very good.\"\nDeSantis pitches higher education changes to discourage diversity training and 'trendy' majors DeSantis proposed policies to limit diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) training and to discourage unprofitable degree programs at America's public universities.\nDEI has been a hot-button topic for conservatives for years, and DeSantis has led the pack . At Thursday's event, he said DEI is \"a cancer\" and has \"fueled some of the nasty antisemitism\" on college campuses as students respond to the Israel-Hamas conflict and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nAs president, DeSantis promised to recognize more accreditation groups that do not require DEI training. That could allow a university to forgo DEI requirements while retaining its accreditation and ability to access federal funds.\nDeSantis also proposed making universities responsible for the debt of students who cannot pay back their loans , which he says will incentivize colleges to cut down on \"administrative bloat\" and unprofitable degree programs. When discussing the issue in his stump speech, DeSantis gives the interchangeable example of a gender studies or a \"zombie studies\" degree.\n\"And then what, they think the sea is going to part for them? It doesn't work that way,\" he said.\nWhen asked whether the change would hurt art or music programs, DeSantis said that \"classic liberal arts subjects\" can still succeed.\n\"Even like Wall Street (professionals), a lot of them took normal, liberal arts subjects, not necessarily business,\" he said. \"But I think there's a difference between those core subjects, which have been part of higher (education) for centuries, and some of the more trendy stuff which have not shown an ability to be lucrative in the private sector.\"\nWith weeks until the caucus, how is DeSantis doing in polls? DeSantis has a vigorous Iowa schedule ahead of the Jan. 15 caucus, including a New Year’s Eve party in West Des Moines.\nHe’s polling at a distant second place behind former President Donald Trump. In an early December Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll, Trump was the first choice candidate for 51% of likely Republican caucusgoers, while DeSantis won support from 19%.\nWhen asked what percentage he needs to win on Caucus Day, DeSantis said simply, \"We're gonna do very well.\"\n\"We're not stopping,\" he said. \"We want everybody to come out and we want them to caucus for us.\nSince the Register released that poll, DeSantis and his endorsers have told Iowa audiences that Trump's dominant lead in the polls is a false media narrative and part of a scheme to ultimately bolster President Joe Biden's reelection bid. He urged the attendees of Thursday's round table to support him on caucus night.\n\"The media thinks they should be able to pick without the voters even having a choice,\" he said. \"And I think there's a lot of Iowans that probably disagree with that.\"\nKatie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register.

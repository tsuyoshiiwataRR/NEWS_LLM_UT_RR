    "text": "Press Release Hampton Man Indicted on Additional Fraud Schemes Thursday, December 28, 2023 Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Digg Reddit Pinterest Email For Immediate Release U.S. Attorney's Office, District of New Hampshire CONCORD – A grand jury returned a superseding indictment against a Hampton man in connection with four fraud schemes, U.S. Attorney Jane E. Young announces.\nAnthony M. Silva, 39, was indicted on a total of 10 counts of wire fraud, 3 counts of mail fraud, and 8 counts of aggravated identity theft. Silva is scheduled to appear in federal court in Concord on January 8, 2024. Previously, on March 21, 2022, Silva was indicted on 3 counts of wire fraud, 3 counts of misuse of a Social Security number, and 3 counts of aggravated identity theft.\nAccording to the charging documents and statements made in court, Silva orchestrated four separate fraud schemes using stolen identities. Specifically, Silva used stolen names, dates of birth, Social Security Numbers, and other identifiers to fraudulently obtain (1) unemployment insurance benefits from Vermont, (2) unemployment insurance benefits from Massachusetts, (3) American Express credit cards, and (4) CARES Act funds. The fraudulently obtained unemployment benefits and CARES Act funds were deposited either by check or direct deposit into dozens of accounts Silva controlled at multiple banks. Many of these accounts were in the names of individual victims or fictional organizations, with Silva listed as the trustee. Silva obtained more than $400,000 from Vermont, over $150,000 from Massachusetts, and $600,000 from the U.S. Small Business Administration. Silva was also able to use the credit cards to make a variety of purchases from retailers such as Victoria’s Secret. Silva also tried unsuccessfully to obtain additional CARES Act funding.\nThe charge of wire fraud and mail fraud provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of either $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is higher. The charge of aggravated identity theft provides for a mandatory sentence of 2 years to be served consecutive to any other sentence imposed. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and statutes which govern the determination of a sentence in a criminal case.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Department of Labor’s Office of the Inspector General and United States Secret Service led the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alexander S. Chen and John J. Kennedy are prosecuting the case.\nThe details contained in the charging documents are allegations. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n###\nUpdated December 28, 2023",

    "text": "A federal appeals court on Thursday denied former President Donald Trump’s request to halt proceedings in E. Jean Carroll’s upcoming defamation trial.\nIn a court filing last week, Trump’s lawyers asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to delay the case for 90 days while he considered appealing the court’s previous rejection of his efforts to use presidential immunity as defending.\nThe appeals court\ndenied that request on Thursday, allowing the trial to begin Jan. 16.\nTrump’s request for a pause in the proceedings came after the appeals court unanimously ruled that the former president had waited too long (three years) to raise his defense of presidential immunity in the defamation trial.\nTrump had argued that he could not be sued over comments he made in 2019 about Carroll and the sexual assault allegations against him because he was president at the time. He also maintained that his comments were related to his official duties as president because he needed to speak publicly about the falsehood of the allegations.\nThe court noted that while Carroll filed his defamation suit in November 2019, followed by Trump’s response in January 2020, he did not raise the presidential immunity defense until January 2023. Allowing him to use that defense now would cause “prejudice.” “undue” to Carroll, the judges said in their ruling.\nThe upcoming trial is the second involving Trump and Carroll, a magazine writer who alleged that Trump raped her in the mid-1990s and defamed her after she spoke publicly about his allegations in 2019. Trump has repeatedly denied the accusations. This year, a jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation and awarded Carroll $5 million in damages, a verdict that Trump is appealing.\nThe second trial focuses on comments Trump made about Carroll during his presidency and after the $5 million verdict, including his disparaging comments toward her, such as calling her “crazy.” The trial, which is expected to last three to five days, only focuses on the monetary damages to which Carroll is entitled.\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in June denied Trump’s immunity argument, writing that presidential immunity “is not a get-away-from-liability card for damages.”\nTrump also raised the argument for presidential immunity in the election interference case brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan dismissed her argument in that case, ruling this month that the former president was not immune from criminal charges. Trump, who has pleaded not guilty in the case, appealed the ruling to the federal appeals court in Washington, DC. The Supreme Court last week denied Smith’s request that the high court immediately decide the matter.",

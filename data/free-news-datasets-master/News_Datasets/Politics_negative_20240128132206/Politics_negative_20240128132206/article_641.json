She’ll remain as a tenured law professor at UPenn.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV, Bok emphasized that while donors are free to contribute to organizations as they see fit, they are not shareholders and should not have a ‘loud voice’ in the governance of universities.\n‘I think donors are absolutely free to give to whatever organizations they want or not to, and to withhold for any reason they choose to. But they are not shareholders, so I don’t think they should have a particularly loud voice on how universities are run.’\n‘The biggest challenge has been that we haven’t had any sort of crisis or controversy in a really long time,’ Bok said this week to Bloomberg.\nOusted UPenn board chair Scott Bok made a bold stand, insisting that deep-pocketed donors shouldn’t be calling the shots on how universities are run. He’s pictured with Liz Magill, who stood down as president earlier this month over her handling of an anti-Semitism crisis\nThis fiery statement comes in the wake of influential alumni pulling their funds in protest of the university’s handling of an anti-Semitism crisis on campus\nBok argued that trustees, typically focused on the financial health of institutions ‘shouldn’t overreact in this situation’ and become ‘involved’ in academics.\n‘It’s a small fraction of one percent of the people at these elite schools that are actively involved in a way that anybody would find troubling,’ Bok said. ‘We shouldn’t fundamentally tear up a governance model that has worked for a very, very long time and made our universities the envy of the world because of a very short-term crisis.’\nThe resignations of Bok and Magill came amid mounting pressure from donors, alumni, and lawmakers, particularly concerning allegations of anti-Semitism on campus.\nMagill was slated over her testimony to Congress about anti-Semitism, when she tried to invoke freedom of speech rules. Critics said the Ivy League college has been selective in its application of students’ and faculty’s First Amendment rights.\nAfter the congressional hearing Bok, CEO of investment bank Greenhill & Co., faced criticism from Wall Street peers, led by Apollo Management Group Inc. CEO Marc Rowan.\nRowan, also head of Penn’s business school board and a significant donor, advocated for his departure and urged other donors to withhold contributions until their resignation.\n‘I call on all UPenn alumni and supporters who believe we are heading in the wrong direction to close their checkbooks until President Elizabeth Magill and Scott Bok, chair of the board of trustees, step down,’ he wrote in a letter reported by Bloomberg in October.\nAt the time, University of Pennsylvania rejected Rowan’s demands, standing by its president and chair of the board of trustees, and brushing off any accusations of antisemitism.\nSimilar donor activism has surfaced at Harvard University, where both billionaires and recent graduates are pausing their gifts in protest against perceived inadequate measures to address antisemitism. President Claudine Gay has resisted calls to resign and has also been embroiled in a separate plagiarism scandal.\nScott L. Bok, Chair of the school’s Board of Trustees, announced his resignation following Magill’s decision to step down in early December – effective immediately\nIn a letter addressed to Magill, the Wharton Board said leadership of the university needed to change ‘with immediate effect’\nMagill resigned following calls for her to quit which only ramped up after she appeared before Congress to explain her response to the anti-Semitism\nHarvard President Claudine Gay at the congressional hearing on antisemitism on campus\nThe hearing also saw widely criticized testimony from MIT president Sally Kornbluth\nLen Blavatnik, a billionaire donor who has contributed at least $270 million to Harvard, recently suspended his gifts.\nEarlier this month, the president of the University of Pennsylvania resigned from her post following fierce backlash to her controversial congressional testimony over antisemitism on campus.\nBok stepped down from his position as the chair of the University Board of Trustees on Dec. 9 — just minutes after Penn President Magill’s resignation.\nMagill, alongside the presidents of Harvard and MIT, was summoned before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce by lawmakers concerned by reports of a rise in antisemitism at leading universities.\nThey faced heated questioning from committee chair Congresswoman Elise Stefanik but failed to assert that calls for genocide against Jews on campus would definitively constitute harassment.\nFollowing international outcry, including more than 70 lawmakers calling for her resignation, Magill stood down on Saturday.",

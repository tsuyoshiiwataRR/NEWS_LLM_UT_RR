    "text": "While the Legislature remains deadlocked over public school funding, Dallas ISD is in dire need of financial restraint in the coming months. A $186 million deficit means hard decisions would have to be made, but public school officials also need to be inventive about how to best use the available resources. Eliminating underperforming high school programs in DISD and redirecting resources to hire more student counselors is a smart approach. DISD officials are looking into enrollment numbers and whether these classes actually prepare students for high-demand jobs after graduation.\nAdvertisement By moving teachers to more productive positions, the district expects to revamp courses and put more students into career and college pathways. DISD also will free up $2.5 million to hire additional counselors, according to an early estimate. Superintendent Stephanie Elizalde wants to have a 300-to-1 counselor-to-student ratio. That would be closer to the American Counselor Association’s recommended ratio of 250 to 1.\nAdvertisement There is a big reason why this strategy makes sense: High school counselors have a direct influence on whether students graduate and attend college. A 2023 study found that student-to-counselor ratios in Texas are correlated with student outcomes, in particular academic achievement and graduation.\nOpinion Get smart opinions on the topics North Texans care about.\nEmail Address By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\nSUBMIT Hiring more counselors is a good return on investment, Todd Williams, Commit Partnership CEO, told The News . “It’s one of the few things that you can invest money in that actually has a dividend to it.” Commit is a nonprofit that works closely with some Dallas County school districts.\nThe ultimate goal is to boost the number of young residents in Dallas who can earn a livable wage. Right now, this goal is uncertain.\nAdvertisement The dropout rate is an enduring concern for DISD and changing the tide is vital for our future. At 80%, Dallas has the lowest four-year high school completion rate of the state’s largest urban districts. These numbers provided fuel to the private school voucher debate in the Legislature, so there is much work to be done.\nFewer students also means less funding for a district that already has enough to deal with, including the possibility of no teacher pay raises this year, a consequence of the political impasse in Austin over the voucher program. Districts were hopeful that a safety bill would provide additional funding, but that also fell apart in the last special session.\nBut even in the best of circumstances, making sure funding and strategy are aligned with graduation objectives should always be the guiding principle for school districts as they connect students with future jobs. Effective counseling is a good starting point.\nAdvertisement We welcome your thoughts in a letter to the editor. See the guidelines and submit your letter here .

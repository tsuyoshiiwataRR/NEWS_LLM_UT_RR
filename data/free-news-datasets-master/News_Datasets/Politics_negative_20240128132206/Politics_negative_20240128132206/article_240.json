    "text": "NARC Kenya Party Leader Martha Karua has faulted the National Dialogue Committee report saying the talks were fruitless and a waste of time for Kenyans.\nSpeaking on Citizen TV’s Tonight Show on Thursday, Karua slammed the Kenya Kwanza government claiming they were from the beginning focused on frustrating the talks and had no intention of addressing the issues raised by the Opposition.\nKarua cited the eight months since the engagement started asserting that the President William Ruto-led regime was only aimed at taking Raila Odinga’s side for a ride and not willing to agree to their demands.\nAccording to Karua, the key issues raised by the Opposition including the cost of living, electoral justice and respect for multiparty democracy had not been achieved and thus the talks cannot be termed a success.\n“The outcome of the engagement with the rogue KK regime, is they have not bored fruits. I think we have been taken into pole dancing which is endless spinning and nothing comes out of it,” Karua said.\n“The duration of the talks is eight months; April to November. What have we gotten out of it, in my view, absolutely nothing because the three issues that we wanted to be addressed were cost of living, electoral justice (forensic audit) and respect of multiparty democracy.”\nKarua went on to blame the Kenya Kwanza outfit for the alleged failure of the talks arguing that despite a continued push for the reduction of the cost of living, the government was instead increasing the prices of basic commodities ignoring the plight of Kenyans.\n“From where I sit, the failure of the talks, and the failure of what people wanted, the blame squarely rests on Kenya Kwanza for they took us for a ride. For any talks to succeed, the party in power is the one that must show utmost goodwill because they are the ones being pushed to show concession of what people want,” she stated.\n“Since then, the cost of living has gone up maybe twice, maybe thrice…while the talks were ongoing, the Finance Bill also came.”\nShe termed the current regime as ‘rogue’ reiterating that President Ruto’s administration was running critical functions of the state in total contempt of the law and disregarding public opinion such as the controversial Finance Act.\n“When you contempt against the constitution, the people who brought you to power and the will of the majority, you become a rogue regime,” she said on why she referred to the government as a rogue.\nTags: Martha Karua Citizen TV Citizen Digital Azimio NADCO Want to send us a story?

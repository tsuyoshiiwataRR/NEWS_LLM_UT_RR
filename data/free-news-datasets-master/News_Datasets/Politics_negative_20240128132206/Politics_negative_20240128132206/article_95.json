    "text": "<article><p class=\"lead\">The US, France, Germany and UK are urging Iran to immediately \"de-escalate\" its nuclear program in response to a UN report that alleges Tehran increased its production of near-weapons grade uranium.</p><p>Iran has recently tripled production of uranium enriched up to 60pc at its Natanz and Fordow enrichment plants, compared to production levels in the first half of 2023, the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a report to its members on 26 December. IAEA inspectors measured production at the plants earlier this month.</p><p>The US, UK, France and Germany said they condemned Tehran for the increased production of highly enriched uranium, which they said had no credible civilian use and carries \"significant\" nuclear proliferation risks. The four countries were among the initial signatories to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, although the US withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018.</p><p>\"These decisions demonstrate Iran's lack of good will towards de-escalation and represent reckless behavior in a tense regional context,\" the US, France, Germany and UK said in a joint statement today. \"We remain committed to a diplomatic solution and reaffirm our determination that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon.\"</p><p>Iranian officials have denied the reports of increased production of highly enriched uranium. Atomic Energy Organization of Iran head Mohammad Eslami dismissed the claims as \"media hype\" meant to distract from Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to Iranian media. </p><p>Regional tensions have increased since Gaza-based group Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October. Earlier today, the US imposed sanctions on exchange houses in Yemen and Turkey it said were facilitating the transfer of \"millions of dollars\" in Iranian funds to Houthi militants in Yemen that have claimed responsibility for attacks against commercial ships in the Red Sea. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps separately said on Wednesday it would seek \"revenge\" against Israel for an air strike that killed one of its senior officers in Syria.</p><p class=\"bylines\"><i>By Chris Knight</i></p></article>",

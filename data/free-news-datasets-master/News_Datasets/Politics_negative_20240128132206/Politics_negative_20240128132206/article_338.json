On Sunday 24 December, London announced the deployment of a military patrol ship, HMS Trent. In response, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro announced on Thursday, December 28, a \"defensive\" military action by Venezuela in the face of the \"threat\" of a British ship in Guyana. In total, more than 5,600 Venezuelan soldiers have been taking part in military manoeuvres of a \"defensive\" nature since Thursday, December 28. \"I have ordered the activation of a joint action of all the [Venezuelan] Bolivarian National Armed Forces in the Eastern Caribbean, on the Atlantic coast, a joint action of a defensive nature, in response to the provocation and threat of the United Kingdom against the peace and sovereignty of our country,\" President Maduro said during a radio and television broadcast. in which he showed images of warships and fighter jets patrolling the area.

We have no intention of invading Venezuela. President Maduro knows this and should not be worried,\" he told a news conference. He also said the arrival of a British patrol boat in Guyana's waters was part of \"routine exercises that have been planned for a long time\". This territorial dispute, which has existed since 1899, has returned to the forefront of the news with the launch, last September, of oil tenders by Guyana, followed by the referendum held on 3 December in Venezuela on a proposal to annex Essequibo. This 160,000 km2 territory, rich in oil and natural resources, administered by Georgetown but claimed by Venezuela, covers two-thirds of Guyana's land area. It is home to about 125,000 people, or one-fifth of the country's population. Read alsoVenezuela-Guyana: could the crisis degenerate into conflict?

    "text": "The Ghana Private Road Transport Union (GPRTU) has threatened to increase transport fares by 60% in 2024 as soon as the Emission Levy Bill takes effect in January 2024.\nThe Spokesperson of the GPRTU, Abass Imoro, made this known in an interview on JoyNews.\nThe Emissions Levy Bill passed by Parliament imposes an annual charge of 100 cedis on all owners of petrol and diesel cars, starting from January 2024.\nThe government's objective with this tax is to encourage the use of environmentally friendly energy sources for vehicle power, aligning with its commitment to climate-positive actions and carbon offset initiatives.\nAccording to Mr Imoro, the Union is already burdened with taxes, therefore, adding another tax would not be favourable.\nHe noted that the Union has written to the Speaker of Parliament for the house to consider a review of the Emission Levy Bill.\nHe said, “In the letter, we indicated that if nothing is done about it, we will increase lorry fare by not less than 60%.”\nThis adjustment, he says is to enable the drivers to cope with the economic burden that may arise from the new tax.\nEarlier, the Minority in Parliament opposed the passage of the Emissions Levy Bill, saying the tax was not well thought through.\nDescribing the levy as ‘wusie tax’, they argued that the tax imposed on all commercial vehicles, private vehicles, ambulances, commercial motorbikes and tricycles would worsen an already dire economic situation in the country.\nBut Energy Minister, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, in defense of the bill noted that the world is moving from internal combustion vehicles and this new levy will help to propel the country to the new era of electric vehicles.\nLatest Stories\n-\nTony Chung: Student activist flees Hong Kong to seek asylum in UK\n29 seconds\n-\nYaa Pono mourns after father dies on Christmas Day\n9 mins\n-\nGPRTU threatens to increase transport fares by 60% over Emissions Levy Bill\n19 mins\n-\nLivestream: PM Express discusses GRA’s tax collection in Ghana today\n2 hours\n-\nAfrican Journalists commit to supporting parents to improve their children’s health\n3 hours\n-\nNPP primaries: John Kumah goes unopposed in Ejisu\n3 hours\n-\nOf resilience, grit, tenacity, and keeping eyes on the ball: Lessons from Afua Asantewaa Aduonum\n3 hours\n-\nSing-a-thon: Afua Asantewaa exceeds Guinness World Record\n4 hours\n-\nFDA arrests suspected drug peddler in Tumu\n4 hours\n-\nExtend VIT implementation date for consultation – GODU to GRA\n4 hours\n-\nHamamat highlights diaspora opportunities, investments at Africa Diaspora Summit\n4 hours\n-\nDon’t let anyone denigrate your achievements – Dr. Bawumia to 2023 WASSCE students\n4 hours\n-\nKwame Sowu: Unheralded Heroine: Afua Asantewaa’s Record Attempt Strikes a Chord for Change\n5 hours\n-\nMbongeni Ngema: South African Musician and ‘Sarafina!’ creator, dies at 68\n5 hours\n-\nPURC recovers GH₵10.73 million for NEDCo, GWCL in 3 regions\n5 hours",

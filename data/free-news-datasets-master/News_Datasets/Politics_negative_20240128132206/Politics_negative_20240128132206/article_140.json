    "text": "The mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, has hired José Manuel Rodríguez Carballo, husband of the first vice-president of the Senate, Javier Maroto (PP), in the City Council. Carballo, as EL PAÍS has learned, started working at the Cibeles palace in October. His position is that of deputy director general of Analysis and Evaluation, which reports to the delegate of Urban Planning and Environment, Borja Carabante, Almeida's right-hand man in the municipal organization chart. The salary of Rodríguez Carballo, a career civil servant who has worked in the City Council of Durango (Bizkaia) for almost 10 years, is around 90,000 euros gross per year, as it is a specific position for category A public employees, belonging to Group 30 of the public administration. A total of 23 people opted for this freely appointed position, according to municipal sources. This newspaper has contacted Maroto by telephone, who has referred to the explanations given by the Madrid City Council.\nA spokeswoman for the Consistory explains by telephone that a \"public, free and transparent\" call was opened for this position where \"any official\" who met the requirements to cover a level 30 could apply. \"Carballo, a career civil servant and level 30 who has been consolidated for more than 15 years, applied for it,\" he says. \"After studying the candidacies, after a report from the governing bodies to which the position of free designation is assigned and certifying all the services rendered, Carballo was elected to the post.\"\nAccording to the information gathered by this newspaper, the Madrid City Council announced the position of Deputy Director General of Analysis and Evaluation in the area of Mobility and Urban Planning in the middle of summer, on August 4. The position was open to all career civil servants at level 30, but the position, according to the Consistory's work portal, was freely appointed. Therefore, the person in charge of the area decides who finally occupies the position based on their curriculum. In this case, the decision corresponded to the then general coordinator of Mobility, Federico Jiménez de Parga, a former deputy in the Assembly of Madrid and a strong man in the PP in Madrid. Jiménez de Parga resigned in October. The City Council, in response to questions from this newspaper, then replied that his departure was due to \"personal reasons\". Two months later, it became known that Jiménez de Parga had resigned from the position of general coordinator of Mobility because he had tested positive in a breathalyzer test on the streets of the capital.\nThe start of the application for the post of Deputy Director-General for Analysis and Evaluation began several days after the call, on 11 August, and ended on 1 September. According to the municipal file, anyone who applied for the position should have \"experience in coordinating work teams, supervising or carrying out innovation projects, strategic planning and environmental sustainability and the 2030 Agenda\". The text ended with a notice of the schedule that the person who wanted to apply for the position would face: \"A more dedicated working day may be required.\" The place was finally awarded to Carballo, who was among the 23 candidates.\nThe award was published in the Madrid City Council Bulletin on the 22nd of the same month. All appointments by the Madrid City Council are published on the Transparency portal, as in this case. However, in Rodríguez Carballo's profile, neither his salary nor his CV still appear, despite achieving the position in September. The calculation of the approximate gross 90,000 euros corresponds to the sum of the different amounts offered by the Madrid City Council for this type of civil servant.\nRodríguez Carballo holds a degree in Economics and Business Administration from the Universidad Comercial de Deusto and is a career civil servant. According to his LinkedIn profile, he has worked as a manager at the Durango City Council (Bizkaia) from 2008 to 2017, 9 years and 10 months. Among other jobs, he has also worked as head of business with clients at the consulting firm Accenture (from 2020 to September 2023) and as deputy general manager of Local Recruitment and Training at the National Institute of Public Administration (between 2017 and 2019). Carballo married Javier Maroto, the current first vice president in the Senate, in 2015. The PP politician was also mayor of Vitoria between 2011 and 2015. Subsequently, he was deputy secretary general of his party under Mariano Rajoy. From 2019 to 2023 he also served as speaker in the lower house. Now, since August and after the changes of Alberto Núñez Feijóo, Maroto serves as first vice president in the Senate.\nJavier Maroto has criticized political nepotism at different times in his career. In 2015, when he was deputy secretary of the PP, he criticized Manuela Carmena, then mayor of the capital. Carmena had appointed Luis Cueto, her nephew-in-law, as general coordinator of the Mayor's Office. \"[Naming a relative] is not doing politics in any other way, but it's the worst thing about the caste,\" Maroto said. In November 2022 and, as stated on the website of the Popular Party, Maroto made another speech in the Senate where he criticised the government of Pedro Sánchez and his advisers: \"There has never been such a large government, not only because of the number of ministers, but also because of the number of advisers, collaborators and other staff, appointed with blatant family and partisan nepotism.\"\nDo you have more information?

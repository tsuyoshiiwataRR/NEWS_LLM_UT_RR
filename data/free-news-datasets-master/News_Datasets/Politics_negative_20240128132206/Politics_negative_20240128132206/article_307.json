    "text": "The Supreme Court of Guam on Thursday affirmed the Superior Court’s decision granting a man’s motion to suppress evidence in a case involving a warrantless search conducted by Guam Police Department officers. A warrantless search is presumptively unreasonable, the upper court said. “In reviewing the trial court’s decision to grant (Zerxes Jabidando) Viva’s motion to suppress and the inconsistencies and contradictions in the officers’ accounts, the trial court’s decision to suppress the evidence was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm the Superior Court’s order granting Viva’s motion to suppress,” the justices wrote. The Dec. 28 opinion was authored by Justice Katherine A. Maraman and joined by Chief Justice Robert J. Torres and Justice F. Philip Carbullido. Because the Superior Court had concerns about the credibility of the people’s witnesses, it was not clearly erroneous for the Superior Court to determine that it was unclear whether Viva consented to the search and that the evidence obtained during the search should be suppressed, according to the Supreme Court. GPD Sgt. Ephraim Amaguin conducted a traffic stop after witnessing Viva drive through a stop sign, based on the transcript of the motion to suppress hearing in July 2022. After pulling over, Viva exited the car on his own, and Viva and Amaguin stood in front of the vehicle. According to court documents, the GPD sergeant performed none of the ordinary inquiries of a traffic stop. He did not ask for Viva’s license or registration, run the plates of the car, check for outstanding warrants, or issue a ticket or citation for failing to stop at the stop sign. Instead, according to Amaguin, he asked Viva: (1) if he was still on probation, to which Viva answered yes, (2) if he had any drugs on him, to which Viva answered no, and (3) for permission to search Viva’s vehicle, to which Viva gave consent, based on Amaguin’s testimony. However, he later testified that he could not recall when in the string of events this conversation had occurred, court documents stated. According to Amaguin, after obtaining consent, he requested backup to conduct the search and GPD Officer Christopher Champion and trainee Officer Clomera Conner responded to the request. According to court documents, Champion testified he did not ask Viva for consent to search the vehicle. He testified he discovered a large kitchen knife and saw a suspicious message banner on Viva’s phone that Champion believed to be related to a drug deal but he took no photographs of the message nor did he extract any data from Viva’s phone. The officers found a baggie containing a substance that tested positive for methamphetamine using a field test. They also found Viva’s wallet containing $2,000 but it’s unclear from their testimony whether they found the wallet during the search of Viva’s car or if they discovered it on his person. Champion arrested Viva. The other officer, Conner, testified that none of the officers read Viva his Miranda rights. In contrast, Champion testified that he read Viva his Miranda rights at the precinct. In its decision and order, the Superior Court questioned the truthfulness of the GPD officers’ testimony and ultimately did not find it persuasive. Instead, the trial court found the officers presented inconsistent testimony and that it was unclear whether Viva consented to the search. Ultimately, unable to find that the officers obtained consent, the trial court granted Viva’s motion to suppress. The Office of the Attorney General appealed the suppression, arguing the trial court did not properly address Viva’s consent. In affirming the trial court decision, the Supreme Court said “the decision to grant Viva’s motion to suppress was based on the trial court’s justified concerns about the credibility of the officers’ testimony, not on a failure to properly address the issue of consent.”",

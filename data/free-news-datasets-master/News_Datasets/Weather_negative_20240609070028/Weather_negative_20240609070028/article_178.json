    "text": "Kolkata: A hailstorm lashed Kolkata on Thursday afternoon even as the Met office issued a red alert against squalls between Thursday night and Friday morning. The rain and thunderstorms could continue till at least Monday (May 13). On Thursday, Kolkata received 61.1mm rain.The rainfall pattern on Thursday afternoon clearly indicated a south-north divide. While several areas in the south received a hailstorm, it gave central and north Kolkata a miss. The KMC drainage pumping station in Ballygunge recorded the maximum rainfall between 1 pm and 4 pm (88 mm) while the one in Maniktala received less than 40 mm rainfall during the same period.109993240 However, unlike Monday when the civic body’s drainage infrastructure was challenged by the sudden impact of a nor’wester, a team of the KMC drainage wing on Thursday operated heavy-duty pumps flushed out storm water within hours.Large parts of south Kolkata, including Gariahat, Alipore, Park Street, Camac Street, Tollygunge and Lake Gardens, received heavy rainfall on Thursday. In central Kolkata, areas like Bowbazar, Sealdah, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and Free School Street were waterlogged briefly. However, waterlogging-prone in the north — Thanthania, Sukeas Street, Amherst Street, Belgachhia, Kankurgachhi and Ultadanga — were spared of inundation.“We are keeping our drainage infrastructure ready for a heavy shower. All other civic departments will also join hands, if need be,” said mayor Firhad Hakim.The third day of moderately intense rainfall this week brought pellets of hail mostly to the southern part of the city and parts of neighbouring districts like the two 24 Parganas. “There does not seem to be a high chance of more hailstorms in the city. Till May 13, we are more likely to see more squalls in Kolkata, before the prolonged rain activity dies down,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) scientist Sourish Bandyopadhyay.“We are currently witnessing a nor’wester spell in the city, associated with a high chance of wind gusting at up to 50-70 kmph,” said H R Biswas, head of weather at RMC.Following the April-May heatwave that ended on May 5, the wind patterns have been conducive for the development of several weather systems this week. By Thursday morning, a cyclonic circulation over Bangladesh and the adjoining area was at 1.5 km above the mean sea level while a trough was running from east Assam to north Odisha across Gangetic West Bengal at 0.9 km above the mean sea level.May has already received more than its monthly normal rain count of 133.6 mm. Since Monday, Kolkata has already seen two heavy spells.On Wednesday, the rain pushed the maximum temperature down to 30.4° C, a 13-notch slide from the season’s highest on April 30 (43°C). On Thursday, the maximum climbed up to 32°C. “The maximum temperature is likely to hover around 30°C. The minimum may fall to as low as 22°C,” said Biswas.",

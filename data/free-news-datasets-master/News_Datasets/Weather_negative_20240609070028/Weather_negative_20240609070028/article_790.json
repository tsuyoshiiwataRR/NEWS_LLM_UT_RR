    "text": "COLUMBIA, Tenn. ( WSMV /Gray New) - A family is grieving after a woman was killed in Wednesday’s tornado in middle Tennessee.\nFamily members said 67-year-old Cheryl Lovett touched so many lives. The loving mother and grandmother was taken in the blink of an eye.\n“She was just an amazing person. She was wonderful,” her daughter Brianne Lovett said.\nBrianne Lovett said her whole world changed in a matter of seconds. In one single moment, she lost not only her mother but also her house and nearly everything she owned.\nBrianne Lovett said the sound of rushing wind was one of the last things she heard before losing nearly everything.\n“I was on the back porch just watching,” she said. “I had just gotten home from work. I just watched it get quiet, and then I started noticing the wind.”\nBrianne Lovett said the next thing she knew, her whole world was spinning.\n“After I got everybody and the dogs in the closet. I dove head-first into the closet and that was when the tornado had taken my house. It’s just gone,” Brianne Lovett said.\nShe said she tried to call and warn her mother up the street, but it was too late.\n“She may have been asleep in her room, but she was at home,” she said.\nBrianne Lovett said both her mother and aunt were thrown out of their home. They found her aunt and rushed her to Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Unfortunately, her mother Cheryl Lovett was found dead.\n“She was mine and my brother’s best friend. She was her grandkids’ best friend,” Brianne Lovett said. “You couldn’t make her mad. She was always smiling. She was always happy. She was a wonderful person. I never wanted for anything.”\nShe said her family isn’t the only ones grieving this loss. Brianne Lovett said the family found her mother’s dog Lulu safe and sitting in one of her chairs.\n“My son went up there to try and find as much of my mom’s stuff as he could for me, and he found [Lulu] sitting in one of my mom’s chairs,” Brianne Lovett said.\nBrianne Lovett is sending out a message after Wednesday’s tornado.\n“Just listen,” she said. “I know they said tornado warning, and people around here, we were the same way, we thought it’s not going to happen, it’s not going to happen, and it happened. It happened. Just take cover.”\nA GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family recover.\nCopyright 2024 WSMV via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "The National Weather Service has issued a Special Weather Statement saying active weather is expected through Saturday, with the risk of severe thunderstorms in the forecast. The NWS reports an unusually strong upper level disturbance moving over the state will support strong to severe thunderstorms, which could produce damaging winds and large hail. “The greatest chance for severe thunderstorms will occur through the day today, with the threat slowly diminishing from west to east tonight through Saturday,” according to the forecast. A Flood Watch also remains in effect for the entire state through 6 a.m. Saturday. Flood Watch for state until 6 a.m. Saturday Update: 3:28 a.m., May 10, 2024 The National Weather Service has issued a Flash Flood Watch for all of the main Hawaiian Islands through 6 a.m. Saturday. The NWS reports the threat for strong to severe thunderstorms and heavy rainfall will continue across the state through tonight as a strong upper level disturbance settles southward over the area. Conditions are expected to steadily improve from west to east later tonight through Saturday as the disturbance drifts eastward. As a precaution, the public is advised: it does not have to be raining at your location for flash flooding to occur. “If you notice signs of heavy rain or thunderstorms upslope, move quickly away from flood prone areas,” according to the NWS. The public is encouraged to monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action should Flash Flood Warnings be issued. NWS: Hawaiʻi Area Synopsis Update: 3:30 a.m., May 10, 2024 The National Weather Service reports the threat for strong to severe thunderstorms and heavy rainfall will continue across the state through tonight as a strong upper level disturbance settles southward into the area. “Although the thunderstorm potential will lower early next week, plenty of moisture lingering combined with afternoon sea breezes and a broad surface trough nearby will support afternoon showers over interior and leeward areas each day,” according to a Hawaiʻi Area Synopsis. The NWS advises that the wet pattern could continue through the latter half of next week as another upper disturbance approaches. Winter Storm Warning for Big Island Summits Update: 3:53 a.m., May 10, 2024 The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for the summits on Hawaiʻi Island from noon today to 6 a.m. Saturday. Heavy snow and very strong winds are expected, with snow accumulations of up to 6 inches and winds gusting over 70 mph. Motorists are advised that travel could be very difficult to impossible in the area with blowing snow significantly reducing visibility at times, with periods of zero visibility. Any travel plans to the summits should be postponed until the threat diminishes. Sponsored Content Comments [View Comments](#)",

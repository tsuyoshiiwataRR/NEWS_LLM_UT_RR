    "text": "FIRST ALERT WEATHER DAY: Strong to severe storms possible into the nighttime hours SHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) - Happy Thursday! It’s a KSLA First Alert Weather Day once again today due to the threat for strong to severe storms in the ArkLaTex this evening. After seeing temperatures reach the 90s again in some locations, and the dew point remaining out of control, we will likely deal with strong to severe storms, on a more widespread basis, across the region. The timing of the storms, unfortunately, coincides with the evening rush hours. Storms look to begin moving into the region around 5 or 6 PM and continue moving through the region into the 10 and 11 PM hours. The main threats are similar to yesterday with damaging wind and large hail being the main priorities along with a chance for isolated tornadoes. According to the latest data, storms look to be mostly over with by around midnight. Tomorrow, a nice and quiet day, will start off in the 60s for the first time I believe this week. We’re looking at plenty of sunshine and lower humidity as temperatures rise into the lower to mid-80s. Saturday will be similar with a little more cloud cover and a slight chance for showers late Saturday night. Sunday sees a more widespread shower chance with highs in the upper 70s and lower 80s. Nothing severe is expected. More rain and storm chances for next week as temperatures rise back into the mid-80s. Copyright 2024 KSLA. All rights reserved.",

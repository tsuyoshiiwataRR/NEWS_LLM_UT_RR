    "text": "A severe storm pummeled a swath of Hays County with high winds and large hail more than 5 inches in diameter. Local social media posts show damage to home and car windows from hail, as well as large trees knocked down by the storm. A storm chaser located west of Dripping Springs was hit by 4.2-inch hail — what some chasers call \" gorilla hail ,\" referring to particularly large hailstones. GORILLA HAIL 4.2 inches in diameter west of Dripping Springs, Texas.— MyRadar Weather (@MyRadarWX) [@NWSSanAntonio] RIP Cappucci’s windshield. [@MatthewCappucci] [pic.twitter.com/tHW3w96OfB] [May 10, 2024] San Marcos CISD announced it was operating on a 2-hour delay Friday to allow staff time to inspect school buildings for damage. A tornado warning was triggered Thursday evening after weather radar showed strong rotation in the storm heading directly into downtown San Marcos. The warning expired at 8:45 p.m. as the threat of a tornado decreased. This is a developing story. If you have photos of hail or storm damage, send them to us at news@KUT.org.",

    "text": "LINCOLN, Neb. — Two new Disaster Recovery Centers are coming to two Nebraska counties to assist tornado victims, following serious damage caused by severe weather recently. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Thursday announced that it is opening two Disaster Recovery Centers this Friday, May 10, in Douglas and Washington counties to provide one-on-one assistance for people affected by the April tornadoes. According to FEMA, the recovery center in Douglas County will open at 8 a.m. Friday. It will be located at the Omaha Police Department’s Community Room in Elkhorn - while the Washington County Center will open at 1 p.m. Friday and will be located at the First Lutheran Church in Blair. Officials said both locations will then be open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., seven days a week, until further notice. They said those in need can apply with FEMA online or by phone before visiting a Disaster Recovery Center, to save time. To apply with FEMA, you can visit their website [here](DisasterAssistance.gov). You can also call FEMA directly at 800-621-FEMA (3362)",

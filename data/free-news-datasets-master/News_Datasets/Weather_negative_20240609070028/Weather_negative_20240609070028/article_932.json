    "text": "Experts are reminding pet owners to take caution over walking their dogs as the weather heats up this weekend. Brits are set for a scorcher this weekend - with temperatures expected to reach 26°C in parts of the [UK](https://www.ladbible.com/uk-news). But with the [weather](https://www.ladbible.com/weather) finally heating up and summer around the corner, pet owners are being warned to take care when walking their [dogs](https://www.ladbible.com/dogs) in the sunshine. Now, if you're a dog owner, then you'll probably know it's a huge no-no to walk your dog in the heat - especially in the middle of the day when the sun is at its hottest. Advert But how hot is too hot? Well, Vets Now [explain](https://www.vets-now.com/summer/your-dog-walking-temperature-guide/): \"Planning on walking dogs in hot weather? It’s generally safe in temperatures of up to 19°C (68°F) but be careful when the mercury rises above this. \"Even at temperatures as low as 20°C (70°F) dogs are at risk of [heat stroke](https://www.ladbible.com/health).\" Between 20 and 23°C, dogs are at risk of heat stroke if exercised too vigorously, or if they're suffering from an underlying condition such as obesity or breathing difficulties. And when the mercury rises even higher, to between 24 and 27°C, dogs who are flat-faced breeds, obese or very young will find the temperatures extremely uncomfortable, with Vets Now warning that extreme caution should be taken. Advert At 28-31°C, the risk becomes life-threatening, with experts warning larger breeds , puppies and those who are flat-faced or obese are particularly at risk. Anything above 32°C and all dogs - regardless of breed - face a life-threatening risk of heat stroke. Ultimately, a temperature above 19°C carries a risk, so it's best to err on the side of caution. To help minimise the dangers, you should avoid walking your dog between the hours of 10am and 4pm, when the sun is at its hottest. Symptoms of heat stroke can include excessive panting, drooling, shaking, rapid breathing, restlessness, and an inability to stand up, as well as being lethargic, having a lack of appetite and generally not acting like themselves. Advert Pet owners should also watch out for their pooch's paws, too. Different surfaces trap heat more than others, and can therefore damage the soles of their paws under the [blazing hot sun](https://www.ladbible.com/weather). If it would hurt you to walk on tarmac and sand in the sun, then it’s going to hurt them, too. So it’s often better to walk your pets on grass instead of pavement in the summer months.Featured Image Credit: Getty stock image",

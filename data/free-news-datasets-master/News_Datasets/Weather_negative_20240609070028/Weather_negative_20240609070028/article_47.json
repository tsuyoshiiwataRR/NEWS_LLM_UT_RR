    "text": "{p}{strong}CODE RED WEATHER overnight-Fri AM; Level 3 & Level 2 severe risk{ }{/strong}{/p}{p}Plan on CODE RED WEATHER overnight into early Friday morning. An Enhanced (level 3 out of 5) risk of severe weather now covers areas along and north of I-10. A Slight (level 2 out of 5) risk covers the rest of the NBC 15 neighborhood. Timing is from Thursday night through Friday morning. Storms will be capable of unleashing damaging winds 70+ mph along with large hail. A tornado cannot be ruled out.{ } Check back for updates as we fine tune the timing of this next weathermaker. It won't be a big rain producer as this front will be a fast-mover.{ }{/p}{p}Download the NBC 15 weather app. Go to the app store and type in WPMI WX. That way, if you're on the go and don't catch us on air or online, you can stay up to date right from your phone. Make sure you have multiple ways to receive watches and warnings. This weathermaker is forecast to march through at a vulnerable time, when many of us are sleeping. You want to have alerts that can wake you up.{/p}{p}Before the front arrives, southerly winds will gust up to 25mph, and max temps will soar near 90. Lows will be in the lower 70s.{/p}{p}In the wake of this weathermaker, temperatures will tumble to the upper 50s Saturday morning with lower 80s for highs both days this weekend. Right now, Mother's Day weekend looks rain-free.{/p}{p}The risk of rip currents at our local beaches will be HIGH Thursday and Friday then moderate for Saturday.{/p}{p}{strong}Meteorologist Kelly Foster{/strong}{/p}{p}NBC 15-area forecasts from the National Weather Service - {a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/mob/marine\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.weather.gov/mob/marine",

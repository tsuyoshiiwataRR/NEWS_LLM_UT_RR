    "text": "Jet2 has issued a 'do not travel' warning to passengers heading to a Greek island, citing ' weather disruption'. The airline has halted flights to Skiathos until Saturday, May 11, and has advised customers not to head to the airport today, Friday, May 10. Customers have been instructed to go back home and only return to the airport three hours before their rescheduled departure time. Situated off Greece's east coast in the Aegean Sea, Skiathos is currently facing heavy rain, as per the UK Met Office, though conditions are expected to improve by tomorrow. Jet2 has expressed that they are keeping a close eye on the situation and extended apologies for any inconvenience this may cause to travellers. The airline stated on its website: \"If you are travelling to Skiathos today, please do not travel to the airport. If you have already travelled to the airport, if possible, we would advise you to return home and come back to the airport 3 hours before your new departure time tomorrow. If it is not possible to make your way home, please speak to a member of our friendly Red team at the airport who will be happy to help.\" \"We apologise for this change that is unfortunately beyond our control, if you are due to travel to Skiathos today, we have sent all details of the change and your options to your email address on the booking. You can also use the search function above, by entering the route you are due to fly on or the flight number, here you will find up to date information regarding your flight.\", reports the Manchester Evening News . The statement further read: \"Finally, it is rare for our schedules to be disrupted like this and although this change is beyond our control, we understand it will disrupt your plans at last minute and have done everything that we can to ensure we operate as soon as possible and minimise the delay.\"",

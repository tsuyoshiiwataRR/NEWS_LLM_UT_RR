    "text": "Heavy rains lashed Bengaluru on Thursday night, causing widespread disruption in the city and its suburbs. The downpour led to water entering Kempegowda International Airport in Devanahalli town, Bengaluru Rural district. According to TV9 reports, rainwater seeped through the roof of Terminal 2, reaching the luggage bay and creating difficulties for airport staff.\nThe airport area experienced thunderstorms and heavy rainfall, resulting in the diversion of more than 18 flights, according to airport sources.\nThis incident comes less than two years after the inauguration of Terminal 2, which commenced operations on August 31, 2023. The terminal, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2022, began domestic flight operations on January 15, 2023.\nApart from airport disruptions, the heavy rains also caused other disturbances across Bengaluru. In Rajarajeshwari City, Nripatunga Road was blocked as four or five trees were uprooted, hindering pedestrian movement.\nBengaluru Weather: Heavy Rains Wreak Havoc At Kempegowda Airport, Flight Operations Disrupted\nAdditionally, in NGF Layout, Nagarbavi, a tree and an electric pole fell on a shed, narrowly missing a family from Raichur who had come to work as laborers. The family, including Shiva, his children, and wife, had a lucky escape.\nOverall, around 70 trees were uprooted in Bengaluru on Thursday night, with 10 in Bangalore South Zone, 32 in RR Nagar Zone, 6 in Bommanahalli, 10 in West Zone, 1 in Mahadevpur, 3 in Yelahanka, 6 in East Zone, and 2 in Dasarahalli Zone.\nMadhuri Adnal Oneindia",

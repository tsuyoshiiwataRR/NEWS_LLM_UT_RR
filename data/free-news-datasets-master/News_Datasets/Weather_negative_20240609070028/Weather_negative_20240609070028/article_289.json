    "text": "The U.S. has seen what feels like an outbreak of tornadoes in recent weeks, with very little sign it could let up.\nIn just the past week more than 100 tornadoes have been reported, which is about the same number Canada sees in an entire year. That has some wondering if similar outbreaks could wreak havoc north of the border.\nSo, are we seeing an unusually high number of tornadoes and should Canada prepare for a more active tornado season?

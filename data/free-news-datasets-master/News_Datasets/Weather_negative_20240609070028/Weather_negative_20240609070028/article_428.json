    "text": "Earth braces for severe geomagnetic storms. Five big eruptions leave the Sun Earth might experience a severe geomagnetic storm when the CMEs arrive this weekend. If geomagnetic storms were hurricanes, 'severe' would be category 4. Listen to Story In Short - CMEs are characterized by massive clouds of solar material - Scientists are observing the developments as sunspot AR3664 grows - The first three CMEs could merge to form a \"Cannibal CME\" Earth is set to be slammed by a series of geomagnetic storms as activity on the Sun peaks and several big eruptions hurtle through the inner Solar System. Five Coronal Mass Ejections (CME), the biggest eruptions on the Sun, have pushed a big mass of plasma and materials through the solar system, which is expected to pass by Earth over the Weekend. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Earth might [experience a severe geomagnetic storm ](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/sun-approaching-solar-maximum-earlier-than-expected-more-eruption-likely-2367613-2023-05-02)when the CMEs arrive this weekend. If geomagnetic storms were hurricanes, 'severe' would be category 4. WHAT IS CORONAL MASS EJECTION? A coronal mass ejection (CME) is a significant release of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun's corona, which is the [outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere.](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/sunspot-carrington-event-earth-sun-solar-system-spaceweather-2537071-2024-05-09) These ejections can occur following solar flares or other solar activity that disrupts the Sun's magnetic fields. CMEs are characterized by massive clouds of solar material, primarily composed of highly ionized gas and embedded magnetic fields, being ejected into space at speeds ranging from hundreds to over a thousand kilometres per second. These eruptions can release as much as billions of tons of solar material into space. When a CME is directed towards Earth and interacts with our planet's magnetosphere, it can cause geomagnetic storms and a [variety of space weather phenomena. ](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/strongest-solar-flare-from-sun-to-hit-earth-today-geomagnetic-storms-likely-2483180-2024-01-02) SCIENTISTS OBSERVING ERUPTIONS Scientists are observing the developments as sunspot AR3664 grows wider and rivals the Carrington sunspot that was last seen in the 1800s. The sunspot is home to all five coronal mass ejections en route to Earth. A coronagraph movie captured by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory shows the [mega eruptions leaving the star. ](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/strongest-solar-flare-from-sun-to-hit-earth-today-geomagnetic-storms-likely-2483180-2024-01-02) Noaa forecasts that the first three CMEs could merge to form a \"Cannibal CME.\" A cannibal coronal mass ejection (CME) is a term used in astrophysics to describe a phenomenon where one CME consumes another. Cannibal CMEs form when fast-moving CMEs overtake and gobble up slower CMEs in front of them. Internal shock waves created by such collisions could spark geomagnetic storms when they strike Earth's magnetic field. WHEN WILL THE ERUPTIONS HIT EARTH? The forecast models show that the eruptions could hit Earth on May 11, and spark a strong (G3) geomagnetic storm. With two more CMEs following close behind, storm levels could become extreme. Meanwhile, successive impacts will be seen with strong auroras being triggered and radio waves likely being hit in some parts.",

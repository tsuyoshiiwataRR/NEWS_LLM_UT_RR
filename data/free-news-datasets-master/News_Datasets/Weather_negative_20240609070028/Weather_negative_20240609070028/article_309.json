    "text": "Severe weather forecast across much of Greece through at least May 10. Disruptions to transport, business, and utilities possible. Adverse weather is forecast across much of Greece through at least May 10. As of early May 10, officials have issued the following weather warnings across Greece: Orange heavy rain and thunderstorm warnings (the middle level on a three-tier scale): Central Greece, Central Macedonia, Crete, Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, South Aegean, Thessaly, and Western Macedonia regions. Yellow heavy rain and thunderstorm warnings: the rest of the affected area. Authorities will likely issue new alerts or update/rescind existing advisories as weather conditions change over the coming days. Sustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where heavy rain has saturated the soil. Authorities could issue mandatory evacuation orders for flood-prone communities over the coming days. Disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible where significant flooding or landslides impact utility networks. Floodwaters and debris flows could render some bridges or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities may temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Flight delays and cancellations at airports are possible. Authorities may temporarily suspend port operations or close beach fronts along the east coast if strong winds trigger hazardous sea conditions. Localized business disruptions are possible in low-lying areas; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of flood damage to facilities, possible evacuations, and some employees' inability to reach work sites. Monitor local media for weather-related updates and advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business arrangements before traveling in the affected areas. Seek updated information on road conditions before driving or routing shipments through areas where severe weather is forecast; plan for possible supply chain disruptions throughout the affected areas. Stay away from elevated streams, creeks, and other watercourses that are prone to flash flooding. Do not attempt to navigate flooded roadways. Exercise caution in elevated terrain due to the threat of landslides, as well as mountainous regions where avalanches pose a threat. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

    "text": "The York-Adams League the cancellation of its softball tournament Friday afternoon after rainy weather forced a slew of postponements. The league cited \"the rainy spring, continued bad weather today, and the forecast\" as the reason for bagging the tournament, which was scheduled for next Wednesday and Thursday, May 15 and 16. The York-Adams baseball tournament was previously canceled on Wednesday. While some York-Adams League teams had already completed their regular seasons, others entered Friday with as many three games remaining on the schedule. Games must be played by next Thursday to count toward the District 3 power rankings. District tournaments in six classifications begin Monday, May 20. In addition to Friday, Rain is forecasted within the league's footprint on Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Both the baseball and softball tournaments have now been wiped out four times in the past seven years. The entire 2020 season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while a bevy of COVID-related postponements wiped out the league's spring championships in 2021. Rainy weather also forced the cancellation of the 2018 tournaments. South Western (20-0, 15-0 Division I) and Kennard-Dale (14-4, 13-1 Division III) have secured outright division titles and were slated to meet in the tournament semifinals on Wednesday. New Oxford and Northeastern were still battling for the D-II crown, while Biglerville and Delone Catholic were set to decide their Division IV race with a pair of head-to-head meetings started Friday. Those matchups are provisionally scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. Littlestown won the 2023 softball tournament with a walk-off win over South Western. The York-Adams League will now stage just two postseason tournaments next week, both at Dallastown High School. The boys' and girls' lacrosse semifinals were contested Thursday and the championship games are set for 5 and 7 p.m. Tuesday. The four-team boys' volleyball tournament, meanwhile, will be contested Monday and Tuesday. Boys' lacrosse: Ungerland twins lead Dallastown to York-Adams final vs. Central York Girls' lacrosse: Dallastown prevails in 3OT; York Catholic awaits in York-Adams final Boys' volleyball: Central York tops Northeastern for boys' volleyball league title Girls' track & field: Bahn, Carlson headline record-breaking day at York-Adams championships Boys' track & field: Red Lion's Strausbaugh sprints to the summit at York-Adams track championships",

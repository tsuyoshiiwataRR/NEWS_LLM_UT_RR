    "text": "Recent severe weather events have caused flash flooding across #Tennessee and southern parts of #Kentucky, #Illinois, and #Indiana. Flash flooding in the Tennessee and Cumberland River basin peaked overnight. As water works its way into the mainstem, portions of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers are at or will reach flood stage by the weekend.\nNashville District Emergency Operations Center activated today to monitor and provide technical assistance as needed.\nCheatham Lock and Dam on the Cumberland River went out of service overnight due to high flows, but is expected to return to service with restrictions as flows subside.\nWater released from Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley are expected to reduce flood impacts on the lower Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.\nUSACE is coordinating with local, state and federal partners to provide assistance.\nCalm and drier conditions are forecasted for the weekend which will assist in recovery and reductions in water levels.\nFor more information, visit https://www.lrd.usace.army.mil\n|Date Taken:||05.09.2024|\n|Date Posted:||05.09.2024 17:19|\n|Photo ID:||8394548|\n|VIRIN:||240509-A-CH700-1234|\n|Resolution:||1920x1080|\n|Size:||333.59 KB|\n|Location:||CINCINNATI, OH, US|\n|Web Views:||3|\n|Downloads:||0|\nThis work, Severe Weather Update - Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, must comply with the restrictions shown on\nhttps://www.dvidshub.net/about/copyright.\nNo keywords found.",

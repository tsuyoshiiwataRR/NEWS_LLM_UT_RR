    "text": "Dick Howser Stadium took on damage from a line of severe thunderstorms and a possible tornado Friday morning. The storm hit around the time when parents started taking their high school students to school. It has forced the closure of the campus as FSU and caused damage throughout the state . Dick Howser Stadium ― the home for FSU baseball ― was among the structures in the path of the violent storm. Tallahassee tornado updates: Schools closed, 60K without power, buildings damaged Pictures showed the tall, green fence in the right field falling over and leaning over the rest of the right field wall. The right field foul pole was also severely bent to the right. Florida State (36-10) was ranked No. 7 in the USA TODAY Sports baseball coaches poll this past week. The Seminoles are scheduled to play ACC rival Pittsburgh at Charles L. Cost Field in Pittsburgh this weekend before a midweek game at Stetson in DeLand, Florida, this weekend. FSU is scheduled to play Georgia Tech next weekend at Dick Howser to close out the regular season. Florida State's last home game prior to the storm was Tuesday, when the Seminoles defeated Jacksonville 7-6 in an 11-inning showdown. This story will be updated.",

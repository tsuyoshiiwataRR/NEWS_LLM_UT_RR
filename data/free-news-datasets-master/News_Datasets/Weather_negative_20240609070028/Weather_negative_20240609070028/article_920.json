    "text": "NOAA space weather forecasters have observed at least seven coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the sun, with impacts expected to arrive on Earth as early as midday Friday, May 10, and persist through Sunday, May 12, 2024. NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) has [issued a Severe (G4) Geomagnetic Storm Watch](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-watch-effect-may-11) for the evening of Friday, May 10. Additional solar eruptions could cause geomagnetic storm conditions to persist through the weekend. This is an unusual and potentially historic event. CMEs are explosions of plasma and magnetic fields from the sun’s corona. They cause geomagnetic storms when they are directed at Earth. Geomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth’s surface, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operations. [SWPC has notified the operators of these systems](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/) so they can take protective action. Geomagnetic storms can also trigger spectacular displays of aurora on Earth. A [severe geomagnetic storm includes the potential for aurora](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/aurora-dashboard-experimental) to be seen as far south as Alabama and Northern California.",

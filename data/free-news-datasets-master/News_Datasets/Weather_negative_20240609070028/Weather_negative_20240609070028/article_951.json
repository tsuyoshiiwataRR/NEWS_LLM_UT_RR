    "text": "MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - Viewers are submitted their photos and videos showing the damage caused by severe weather that moved through central Alabama Thursday night. There were multiple reports in areas like Greenville, where straight-line winds toppled trees and knocked powerlines down across roads. In Tuskegee, trees and powerlines fell in front of Lincoln Gate, the main entrance to Tuskegee University. READ MORE Storms hit Florida, Mississippi and elsewhere amid cleanup from earlier tornadoes Powerful storms left thousands without electricity Friday in Florida and other Southeastern states. In Elmore County, there were reports of hail, some reportedly the size of baseballs, as well as downed trees in the Wetumpka area. Thursday’s storms were intense, but did not bring any tornado warnings to central Alabama, and there were no reports of major injuries. Damage assessments are ongoing.

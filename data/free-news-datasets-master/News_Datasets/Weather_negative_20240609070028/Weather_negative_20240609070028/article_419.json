We got down and about 20 minutes later it was gone,” Buckner said.\nHis yard is littered with pieces of tin roofing, two-by-fours, and power lines. Some of the debris came from a damaged storage facility belonging to the Georgia Forestry Commission.\n“It sounded more like the wind whistling, and it came out of this side. It just wrapped around. It just wrapped around us,” Buckner said.\nLuckily, the Buckner family survived the wrath, but faces a long road to recovery.\n“I went right in the house in the nick of time, and it just tore everything up,” Buckner said.\nReturn to Atlanta News First for updates on this developing story.\nCopyright 2024 WANF.

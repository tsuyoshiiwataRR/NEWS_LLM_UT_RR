    "text": "Florida has been experiencing a heat streak over the past week, consistently reaching highs in the 90s — though “feels-like” temps have been even hotter .\nDue to the extreme temperatures, SunRail announced on Thursday evening that all of its trains were running on a 5-10 minute delay .\nRecommended Videos\nAccording to Business Insider , intense heat can cause steel railroad tracks to expand and lengthen, making them appear almost like spaghetti.\nThis can cause the tracks to “buckle” under the stress, which can be a huge risk for trains operating on them. As such, rail networks typically reduce the speed of their trains when the temperature goes over 86 degrees.\n[EXCLUSIVE: Become a News 6 Insider (it’s FREE) | PINIT! Share your photos ]\nWhile SunRail later announced that its trains were back on schedule, it’s an indicator of just how hot Central Florida has gotten recently.\nDue to extreme temperatures, all trains are running at restricted speed. Expect 5 to 10 mins delays.\n— SunRail (@RideSunRail) May 9, 2024 However, the region is expected to get a break from the hot weather thanks to approaching showers that are expected to cross through, which should bring the temperatures down a little.\nIn the meantime, it’s also important to remember these safety tips to avoid heat exhaustion:\nNever leave pets/children inside a parked vehicle Drink water/stay hydrated Reduce strenuous activities Find shade or stay in A/C Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing",

    "text": "The aftermath of severe storms earlier this week continues to cause problems on roads in the Great Smoky Mountains. Parson Branch Road, Hyatt Lane, and Ramsey Prong Road remain closed May 10 due to high water, according to the Smokies Road Info account on X , formerly known as Twitter. Cades Cove Loop Road and Greenbrier Road are now open. Ramsey Cascades Trail will remain closed May 10-12. Weather conditions prevented trail crews from completing planned work on a footlog bridge this week and need to keep the trail closed for visitor safety, the National Park Service announced May 9. Hikers throughout the park are advised to use caution over the next few days because of downed trees and some flooding caused by the storms and heavy rain. Severe storms rolled through East Tennessee earlier this week, bringing heavy winds and dumping up to 4 inches of rain across the region within a 24-hour period. During the storms, a Tazewell man died after a tree fell on a vehicle, and a warehouse roof collapse in Knox County, causing a massive gas leak and minor injuries to two people.

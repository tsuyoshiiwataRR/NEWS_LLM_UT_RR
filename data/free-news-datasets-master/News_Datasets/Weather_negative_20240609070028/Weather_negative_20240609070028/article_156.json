    "text": "Chennai: Many parts of the city’s southern suburbs experienced surprise showers on Thursday which brought both the day temperature and power demand down. IMD has forecast light to moderate intensity rainfall that may keep day temperatures below normal for the next two days. Bloggers said rain intensity may increase later next week. On Thursday morning, many areas such as Tambaram, Perungalathur and Velachery received light rainfall. The rain gauge in West Tambaram recorded 2mm. Soon after, day temperatures dropped to 35.6°C and 36.6°C in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam, which were 0.8 and 1°C below normal. “For the next 48 hours, the city and the suburbs are likely to receive light to moderate intensity rainfall. Maximum temperatures may be at 35°C-36°C and minimum temperature is likely to be at 28°C-29°C,” an IMD bulletin said. The dip in temperature on Thursday led to a slight drop in power demand, compared to Tuesday. Around 10am, the city's power demand was 3,605MW, about 100MW lesser than Tuesday and around 4pm, the power demand was 3,859MW, compared to 4,059MW recorded on Tuesday. However, Tangedco officials said that the power demand might go up in the night hours due to air conditioners' usage, but it will still be less compared to previous days. Rainfall brought down the overall power demand in the state by at least 500MW on Wednesday. The peak lighting demand (when the lights are switched on after sunset) on Wednesday was 18,876MW, while the demand around the same time was 19,419MW on Tuesday. \\\"Since there was rainfall in different districts, the power demand reduced,\\\" said officials. On Wednesday, power consumption too came down by 11 million units to 428mu from 439mu on Tuesday. Blogger Pradeep John said, “The rain intensity may increase along coastal areas including Chennai between May 16 and 20 as an upper air circulation is likely to form next week.” We also published the following articles recentlyChennai's power demand soars to 4,560MWChennai and the state experienced a surge in peak power demand and electricity consumption.

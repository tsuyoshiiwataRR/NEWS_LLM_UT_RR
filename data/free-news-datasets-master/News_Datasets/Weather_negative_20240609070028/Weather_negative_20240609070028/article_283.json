    "text": "JACKSON COUNTY, N.C. (WLOS) — A Jackson County campground saw big impacts from a powerful overnight storm. Residents believe it could have been a tornado. The white pines at the Trout Creek Campground near Glenville have very shallow root systems. Given high wind and some saturated ground, they can fall. That's what happened shortly after midnight, very early Thursday morning. When they fell, they didn’t, however, take direct hits on the campers. It was a close call though, and very fortunate since there were people inside them at the time. “Never seen anything like this before,” says Darryl Wiggins. He and his wife, Elaine, have been coming to the mountain campground for four years now, escaping the South Georgia heat. They didn't expect the severity of the overnight weather full of thunder and lightning.

Their son was busy Thursday morning chain sawing the debris away. They’re all thankful no one was hurt and consider themselves lucky. The Wiggins believe it was a tornado. “I would say it was,” says Elaine. “I would say it was and probably didn't come as low. You’ll see a lot of trees down there where the tops are snapped out, and that’s the reason I think it’s mainly a tornado,” says Darryl. One of the six trees that fell barely missed another camper. The resident wasn’t there at the time. The tree smashed the windshield of his vehicle. Jackson County EMS officials were on site Thursday to help assess the severity of the storm. Official word whether this was a tornado will come from the National Weather Service. “They will send a survey crew out and check the area. But from what we're seeing it does look like maybe an EF-0 tornado has hit in this area,” says Jackson County EMS Director Todd Dillard. He says electricity remains out in the area. “Power, phones, there's some broken poles on up the road,” he says, adding it could be later this week before it’s back on.

I just heard a lot of snapping around us. That's when we started getting real worried,” says Louie Colon. He and his wife took cover between their bathroom and their bedroom and survived. He has a generator to keep the power on and gives a nod to their faith. “Lord had his hand on all this,” says Colon. The Wiggins are also grateful. “We are very thankful,” Elaine says.",

    "text": "Dark areas have best chance to see Northern Lights, expert says. PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Some Arizonans were treated to a light show on Friday night, as a geomagnetic storm caused the northern lights to shine bright colors in the sky. The lights were seen as the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center issued a geomagnetic storm watch for the first time since 2005. View of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights, may continue for the next several nights as well. Viewers posted photos of the northern lights on AZFamily’s First Alert Weather page of a pink and purple glow in the sky that could be seen from areas like Show Low, Prescott, Sun City West and Queen Creek. This watch has been issued because something called a coronal mass ejection (CME) was released from the sun earlier this week. So, how does this cause a geomagnetic storm? Arizona’s Family spoke with Katrina Bossert, assistant professor in the Arizona State University School of Earth and Space Exploration, who said the CME causes the “Earth’s magnetic field to be displaced” and that you can “end up with these magnetic field lines causing material to be thrown towards the earth’s atmosphere.” While the best views will be at northern latitudes, Bossert said Arizona may be treated to a light show as well. “If you look to the north, you may be able to see some red aurora on the horizon,” she said. “If it’s really strong, you may be able to see some green aurora on the horizon.” She also suggests being in a dark area for the best possible chance of a good view. While geomagnetic storms have been known to affect the Earth’s power grid, Bossert said that’s more likely to happen more in northern latitudes. Even though this type of impact is unlikely in Arizona, “it is still something to look out for,” Bossert said.

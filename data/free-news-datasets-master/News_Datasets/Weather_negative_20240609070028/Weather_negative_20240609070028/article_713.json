    "text": "01:22 HONOLULU — A powerful weather system drenched the Hawaiian Islands on Friday, triggering flash flooding alerts across the state and even a Winter Storm Warning — yes, that’s not a typo — for the mountain summits along the Big Island.\nA potent upper low-pressure center swirling just to the north of the island provided copious amounts of tropical moisture along with atmospheric instability that produced strong thunderstorms that may even reach severe criteria with 50 mph wind gusts and large hail.\n\"Once a shower or thunderstorm develops, it&apos;ll be capable of producing strong wind gusts right along just before and right after that heavy shower,\" National Weather Service, Honolulu Meteorologist Derek Wroe told KHON-TV. \"You can see wind gusts in excess of 50 miles per hour with a shower, which is concerning since we know we have a lot of graduation activities going on.\"\nHOW OFTEN DO TROPICAL SYSTEMS IMPACT THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS?\nAside from frequent lightning and gusty winds, torrential rains with some storms’ rain rates up to 3 inches per hour will present an islands-wide flash flood threat. The northern side of Oahu picked up 2-4 inches of rain Friday while the northern tip of the Big Island reported 4-6 inches of rain.\nFlood Watches have been extended through Saturday night as heavy rain showers and thunderstorm continue to drift across the islands. Flood-prone roads and other low-lying areas are under threat to close due to runoff and overflowing streams. Rapid runoff could also cause property damage in urban areas.\nShowers should taper off later in the weekend as the low pulls away.\nA Winter Storm Warning in Hawaii in mid-May Perhaps even more surprising is the wintry weather heading for the higher elevations of the Big Island.\nAMONG SUREST WEATHER BET IN AMERICA: PREDICT RAIN IN THIS HAWAII TOWN IN JULY\nWinter Storm Warnings were effect for all mountain summits into Friday night. As much as 6 inches of snow is likely along with blistering winds of 40-60 mph with gusts over 70 mph, the NWS said.\nThe warning was downgraded to a Winter Weather Advisory on Saturday but the summits could still see up to 2 inches of snow and freezing rain with 55 mph gusts.\nWhile drier weather is in the offing Sunday, a moist pattern will remain into the new week, with long-range models suggesting another period of stormy weather looming later in the week.\nTags Winter Weather Flood Severe Weather Hawaii Forecast",

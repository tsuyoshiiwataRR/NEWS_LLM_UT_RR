    "text": "Worst Delta hubs for summer weather delays?\n#\n1\nOriginal Poster\nJoin Date: May 2015\nLocation: Flyover country\nPrograms: DL DM\nPosts: 57\nWorst Delta hubs for summer weather delays?\nI realize it depends on the day and degree of luck, but are there any opinions (or better yet statistics) on which Delta hubs are worst for weather delays June - August?\nTravel is to or from IND, I usually connect MSP, SLC, ATL. I tend to travel in the afternoon or evening and I'm wondering if I should switch to morning travel when possible.\nThere may be a thread that's discussed this in the past, but I couldn't find it. If it's already been discussed, just point me to the link please.\nTravel is to or from IND, I usually connect MSP, SLC, ATL.

Id recommend trying to switch to morning travel for ATL connections, and if an evening trip is needed, explore other hubs.",

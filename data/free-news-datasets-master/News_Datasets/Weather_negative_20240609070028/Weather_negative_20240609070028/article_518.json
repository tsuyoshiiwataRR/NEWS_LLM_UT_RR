    "text": "By Athena Stavrou ,\n2 minutes ago\nThunderstorms and heavy rain are set to hit large swathes of the UK on Sunday just one day after Saturday could possibly be the hottest day of the year so far.\nSaturday is predicted to see temperatures rise as high as 26C in parts of south-east England , including around London, in what would be the hottest day of the year.\nHowever the hot weather could be short lived as a yellow weather warning for thunderstorms is set to come into place on Sunday.\nImpacting large swathes of Wales and western England from north to south, the warning will come into place from midday on Sunday and remain until 10pm.\nThe warning comes with a possibility of flooding, travel delays and power cuts.\nHeavy showers and thunderstorms are likely to break out in the south of this area late Sunday morning and early Sunday afternoon, moving steadily north whilst growing into larger areas of rain before clearing the area,” the Met Office said.\n“Some intense downpours are possible in a few places, giving up to 30 mm in less than hour and perhaps 40-50 mm over 2 to 3 hours leading to surface water flooding. Hail, frequent lightning strikes and strong wind gusts will be additional localised hazards.”\nMore follows on this news story....\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

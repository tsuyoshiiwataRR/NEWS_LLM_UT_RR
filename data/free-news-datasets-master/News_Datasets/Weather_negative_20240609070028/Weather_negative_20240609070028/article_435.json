    "text": "Jet2 has warned holidaymakers due to fly to Skiathos today (Friday) not to turn up at the airport as bad weather has delayed flights. Departures have been put back until Saturday amid strong winds and thunderstorms forecast for the Greek island. The Hellenic National Meteorological Service issued warnings for “heavy thunderstorms” affecting the Sporades archipelago island. Jet2 issued a weather disruption alert for Skiathos on its website at 4.15am today. The company, which serves the island from seven UK airports, said: “Due to adverse weather conditions forecast for Skiathos on Friday 10th May 2024, we have delayed all Skiathos flights until tomorrow. “If you are travelling to Skiathos today, please do not travel to the airport. “If you are due to travel back to the UK today, please continue to check our website. We will also communicate to you via text and email. “We apologise for this change that is unfortunately beyond our control. “Tt is rare for our schedules to be disrupted like this and although this change is beyond our control, we understand it will disrupt your plans at last minute and have done everything that we can to ensure we operate as soon as possible and minimise the delay. “We have a huge team working hard behind the scenes at our UK-based HQ that are monitoring the situation and on behalf of us all, we are sorry again for the inconvenience this delay brings.” Flight-only passengers have been offered a free change onto the next available flight to the island or the option to cancel with a full refund. Package holiday customers wanting to change travel arrangements were advised to telephone the company.",

    "text": "CANCELLED • The Clarice's Outdoor Movies: Ferris Bueller's Day Off This event is cancelled due to expected inclement weather. ABOUT THE EVENT New this Spring! Clarice Presents brings outdoor movies to campus! Join us for the timeless film Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). A charismatic high-school student convinces his repressed best friend to play hooky with him and his girlfriend and attempts to bring the young man out of his shell during a memorable day in Chicago. Registration is free and encouraged! FOOD, BEVERAGE & SEATING The Funnel Fare truck will be onsite 7-10PM with a menu of funnel cakes, deep fried oreos, deep fried twinkies, nachos, popcorn and lemonade available for purchase. Guests are also welcome to bring their own food and beverages! Please note, a limited number of blankets will be available to borrow. We encourage guests to bring their own lawn chairs and picnic blankets. A tarp underneath your blanket is recommended, as the grass can get damp in the evening. The Clarice Courtyard is located behind The Clarice. Guests can enter The Clarice using any entrance, and head to the second floor at the top of the grand staircase. An elevator is available. FUNDING This event is supported in part by the Maryland State Arts Council and The Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation.",

    "text": "Somalia: 2024 Gu (April to June) Season Floods Weekly Situation Report No. 1 - as of 10 May 2024 HIGHLIGHTS - Humanitarian partners are working with the Federal Government of Somalia to respond to the Gu (April to June) rains and have so far reached some 72,000 people with some form of assistance. - At least 203,438 people have been affected including around 37,120 displaced or relocated and nine people killed, as of 8 May, according to authorities. The rains have also damaged infrastructure and killed livestock. - Hirshabelle, Jubaland and South West states are the worst affected. - On 6 May, 117mm of rainfall was recorded in Doolow, Gedo region; the highest recorded in one day since 2016 and about a quarter of the rainfall usually recorded for one season in the area, according to FAO/SWALIM. - The [2024 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan](https://fts.unocha.org/countries/206/summary/2024), which requires US$1.6 billion is just 11 per cent funded. Additional funds are required to urgently meet the needs of the affected people. SITUATION OVERVIEW The Gu (April to June) heavy rains and flash floods have spread to more areas of Somalia and have affected at least 203,438 people, including around 37,120 displaced or relocated and nine people killed as of 8 May, according to authorities. Humanitarian partners are working with the Federal Government of Somalia, and they have so far reached over 72,000 people in 25 districts with some form of assistance across the country. The floods have destroyed and damaged infrastructure including some 3,080 shelters, 4,702 latrines, three schools and killed at least 100 livestock. Shallow wells have been submerged and some destroyed, which in turn, poses a risk of cholera outbreak. Additionally, hectares of agricultural land have been inundated by the floods, jeopardizing food security and might lead to an increase in price instability. Hirshabelle, Jubaland and South West states are the worst affected. According to humanitarian partners, at least 770,000 people could be affected by the time the Gu season ends. Along the Shabelle River, the water level in Belet Weyne was above the moderate risk levels as of 6 May while in the Juba River, water levels at Doolow exceeded the high flood risk level following heavy rains (117mm) on 6 May, reportedly the highest recorded in one day since 2016. The rain was about a quarter of the amount usually recorded in one season in the area. The rains have led to muddy road conditions, restricting the movement of people and goods, including humanitarian supplies in some areas of Somalia. Light rains are forecasted over most part of the country with moderate rain likely over Lower Shabelle and coastal parts of Lower Juba, from 8 to 14 May, according to [FAO-Somalia Water and Land Information Management](https://www.faoswalim.org/) (SWALIM).",

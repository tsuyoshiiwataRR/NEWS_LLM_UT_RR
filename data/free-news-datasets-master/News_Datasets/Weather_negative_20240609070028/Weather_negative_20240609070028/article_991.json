Conditions should steadily improve from west to east late Friday into Saturday.”\nForecasters say this strong, upper-level disturbance is unusual for this time of the year.\n“We are not looking at a widespread rain event. Rather, we are looking at a scattered heavy shower event with isolated strong to possibly severe thunderstorms,” the weather service said Thursday afternoon. “Due to the scattered nature of the event, sudden changes of the weather should be expected. It could be sunny and fair weather one hour and you could be under a severe thunderstorm the next hour.”\nWindward and mauka areas are favored for rainfall, especially along Oahu’s Koolaus.\nIn the special weather statement, forecasters said the public should be prepared to take action should flash flood warnings be issued, particularly for those in flood-prone areas.\nThe weather service also reminds the public that flash flooding also can occur in locations where it is not raining and well downstream of heavy rains.\n“If you notice signs of heavy rain or thunderstorms upslope, move quickly away from flood-prone areas,” forecasters said.\nConditions are expected to stabilize over the weekend, but “conditions will likely be more wet than normal, especially during the afternoons.”\nMeanwhile, a high wind warning is in effect for Hawaii island summits through 6 a.m. Saturday. Weather officials say to expect southwest winds of 40 to 60 mph with localized gusts over 70 mph. A winter storm warning has been issued for the same summits from noon today through 6 a.m. Saturday. Heavy snow with accumulations of up to 6 inches is forecast, the weather service said.\n“Travel could be very difficult to impossible,” the weather service warning said. “Blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility at times, with periods of zero visibility.”\nA high surf advisory is also in place for the south-facing shores of all isles through 6 p.m. Friday due to a south swell. Forecasters said large, breaking waves of 7 to 10 feet are expected along south-facing shores through 6 p.m. today, and that strong currents will make swimming dangerous.",

    "text": "The fine weather is expected to end on Sunday A weather warning has been issued for four counties in Northern Ireland as the fine spell we’re currently experiencing looks set to come to an end on Sunday. The Met Office has issued a Status Yellow thunderstorm warning for Armagh, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Derry, which will come into effect at 11am on Sunday morning and remain in place until 7pm on Sunday evening. The warning flags that there will be heavy showers and that isolated thunderstorms may develop across western Northern Ireland during the day on Sunday. As of yet, there has been no warnings issued by Met Éireann for counties in the Republic of Ireland, but the forecaster has warned of the “possibility of thunderstorms” on Sunday, as well as “outbreaks of heavy showers” and generally cooler conditions than we’ve experienced in recent days. Before that, another glorious day is in store on Saturday with highs of 22 degrees, following on from the hottest day of the year so far on Friday, when temperatures tipped above 24 degrees during the afternoon. Check out the Met Éireann forecast for the coming days below. Friday night Tonight will be dry with clear spells. Patches of mist and fog will develop in the south early in the night and more widely overnight. Lowest temperatures of 7 to 10 degrees with light variable breezes.

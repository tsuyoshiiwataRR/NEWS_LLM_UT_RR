    "text": "Heavy overnight rain disrupted flight services and caused widespread chaos in Bengaluru, according to officials at the Kempegowda International Airport on Friday. The downpour led to the diversion of several flights, including international passenger flights. Heavy rainfall accompanied by strong winds rendered the airport inaccessible for landing between 9.35 pm and 10.29 pm, leading to diversion of flights, a Bengaluru International Airport Limited (BIAL) official said in a statement.He said 13 domestic flights, three international passenger flights, and one international cargo flight were diverted to Chennai on Thursday.The rain also brought down many trees in several parts of the city, including Jayanagar, Nrupathunga Nagar, and RR Nagar. Despite the disruption, the rain provided relief to Bengaluru residents from the blistering summer heat, a phenomenon not witnessed for many decades.The India Meteorological Department reported that Bengaluru city received 14 mm of rain in the 24-hour period till 8.30 am on Friday. The maximum and minimum temperatures in the city stood at 33 and 22 degrees Celsius, respectively, in the last 24 hours.On Thursday, Bengaluru witnessed another heavy spell of rain, with a yellow alert in place. The massive rains caused waterlogging across the city, leading to traffic standstills during the night. Bengaluru traffic police deployed their staff in many areas to decongest the traffic due to the heavy rain.Several crucial bottlenecks in the city faced traffic snarls due to the showers, with commuters experiencing long hours stuck on the road. Areas like Airport Road, Chalukya Circle to Hebbal flyover, Sumanahalli junction, Nayandahalli junction, ORR â€“ Hebbal, Gorguntepalya, and Nayandahalli were jam-packed with vehicles, prompting police intervention to clear the traffic.The road to Kempegowda International Airport at Hunasamaranahalli was also flooded, causing delays for commuters. The Bengaluru traffic police advised flyers to choose alternate routes due to the road being submerged.The busy Mysuru road also faced constant traffic jams due to waterlogging, with traffic diverted to Jnanabharathi campus. A few underpasses in the city were closed to prevent any loss of lives due to heavy rains causing waterlogging.The intense rains continued throughout the night in some parts of the city, with commuters likely to face traffic difficulties on Friday morning. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) staff were on the ground, clearing uprooted trees due to gusty winds. Hailstorms were also reported in some parts of the tech capital.(With inputs from PTI)",

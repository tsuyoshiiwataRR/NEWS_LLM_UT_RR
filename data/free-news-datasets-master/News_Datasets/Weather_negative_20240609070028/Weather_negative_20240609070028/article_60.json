    "text": "There are two threats for Friday: one is the potential for morning frost and the second is afternoon thunderstorms that could become strong to severe. First, the frost. A Freeze Warning is in effect for Rusk County and a Frost Advisory is in effect for Barron, Chippewa, Clark, Eau Claire, Jackson, Taylor, and Trempealeau counties from 2am until 8am Friday morning. Cover up or bring inside any sensitive plants you have put outside. It is most likely outside of the Eau Claire-Altoona-Lake Hallie-Chippewa Falls metro area with the greatest chance north and east of Eau Claire. Still, patchy frost can't be ruled out anywhere in the Chippewa Valley even outside of the alert area. Frost is possible when low temps drop to 36, but doesn't become likely until the low drops to 34. The exact air temperature frost forms at depends on several factors, including wind speed and availability of near-ground moisture. It requires the temperature within inches of the ground to hit the freezing mark, but all of our temperature sensors and forecast low temps are for 2 meters above the ground, so that's why the ice can form on grass and trees when the air temp is above freezing. That makes it difficult to track when the average date is for the last frost of the year, but the average last 34 or colder low temperature is May 14. Any evening shower tonight will end before 9pm, and then the sky will clear out to allow for these colder low temperatures tonight into tomorrow morning. Tomorrow will begin sunny, but a few clouds will begin to form ahead of the afternoon chances for scattered showers and storms. Expect them to begin after noon in Polk County and arrive in the Chippewa River Valley between 2 and 4 PM. A few isolated showers and storms will continue after that first broken line moves through, though chances quickly decrease during the late evening and the sky will clear out overnight into Saturday morning. Western Wisconsin is yet again under the Storm Prediction Center's (SPC's) level 1 risk for severe weather, meaning that an isolated severe storm is possible. The main threat will be marginally severe straight-line wind gusts. The severe threshold is 60 mph wind, and the strongest storm may be capable of hitting that mark. Hail is a very low secondary threat while tornadoes and flash flooding are both incredibly low risk, if not zero risk. Temperatures will warm up this weekend with highs near 70 with sunshine on Saturday and possibly hitting 80 for the first time this year on Mother's Day Sunday! There is a return of a slight chance for showers and storms in the afternoon and evening on Mother's Day, with isolated showers and possibly storms possible Sunday and Monday. Tuesday looks dry before better chances for rain and storms arrive Wednesday and Thursday.",

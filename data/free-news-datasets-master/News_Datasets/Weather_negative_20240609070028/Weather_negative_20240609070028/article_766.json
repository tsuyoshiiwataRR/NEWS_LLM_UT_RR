    "text": "By Mitch Perry ,\n1 hour ago A downed tree blocks a street in Tallahassee’s Lafayette Park neighborhood (photo credit: Diane Radio)\nQuality Journalism for Critical Times\nThere are reports Friday morning of possible tornado activity in Tallahassee, with over 66,000 customers without electricity as of 9:00 am today, according to the City of Tallahassee’s X account.\n“Early assessments of the electric grid show severe damage to transmission lines, impacting 11 substations,” the X account reported, with restoration perhaps taking through the weekend.\nThe Leon County School District announced that due to storm and tornado recovery they have closed all school campus for the remainder of Friday. The campuses of Florida State University and Florida A&M University also today announced that their campuses would be closed.\n“Following the completion of the first wave of storm assessments, it has been determined that the severe impact on campus necessitates the closure of the Tallahassee campus for business operations until further notice,” an FSU alert reported . “Essential employees may be required to report to campus, and certain scheduled activities must continue. Employees should contact their supervisors to determine essential status. There’s no reported damage to FSU’s Panama City, FL, campus. The FSUPC campus will operate as scheduled.”\nThe post Reported tornado hits downtown Tallahassee – more than 60,000 without power appeared first on Florida Phoenix .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

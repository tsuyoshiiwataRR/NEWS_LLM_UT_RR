So far, we have determined it was a possible spin-up that occurred and had a top speed of 75 miles per hour,\" said Clay Chaney, a National Weather Service meteorologist.\nHe said this type of storm is rather significant, but it is not uncommon at this time of the year.\n\"Most of the damage occurred in the downtown Anderson, Clemson Boulevard area,\" Chaney said.\nChaney surveyed an area near Belton-Honea Path High School Friday morning.\n\"We conducted windshield surveys to assess the damage in the area, taking note of any property damage to personal property and businesses,\" said Cade Treffeisen, deputy director of Emergency Management for Anderson County.\nAccording to Steve Wilkins with the National Weather Service, \"We saw scattered trees and structural damage to homes and businesses as we drove through the city of Anderson. \"We determined the damage was caused by a straight-line wind circulation that traveled north of Anderson.\n\"We will know if it was a tornado within a few hours,\" Wilkins said.\nAccording to a Duke Energy Map of power outages in the Upstate, Anderson County was the hardest hit, with 19,000 Duke customers without power as of Thursday morning.\nOn Friday, Carolina Power helped restore power on North Street, which affected several homes near Linley Park.\nA fallen Oak tree was visible near the AnMed Health Services building on Calhoun Street in Anderson, a tree had fallen on a house on Shannon Way in Anderson, and a fallen tree was visible off State Highway 252 in Belton.\nThursday morning in Honea Path A Honea Path homeowner in Anderson County recorded what appeared to be a possible tornado on Thursday morning.\nLori Dozier captured video and photos of what appeared to be a funnel cloud in Anderson County early Thursday morning as severe storms moved through the area. She posted the video and pictures on her social media accounts.\nAt 2 a.m., she started recording the storm using her cell phone, pointing it toward the neighbor's home as the children woke up the rest of the family, which included Dozier's partner, father, and son.\n\"We witnessed a downdraft that caused our porch lights to swing back and forth and almost tip over,\" Dozier said in a previous article with the Independent-Mail.\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated.\nTravis Rose covers Anderson County for the Independent Mail.

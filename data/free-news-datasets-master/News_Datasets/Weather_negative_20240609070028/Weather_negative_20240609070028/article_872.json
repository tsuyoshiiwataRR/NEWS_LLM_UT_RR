(FOX Carolina) - The National Weather Service is in the Upstate on Friday to survey the damage left behind by severe storms earlier in the week. Multiple tornado warnings were issued across the western Carolinas overnight Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Parts of Anderson County, Laurens County and southern Greenville County were included in the tornado warnings. Residents in Anderson County were among some of the worst-hit in the area, with winds [uprooting massive trees](https://www.foxcarolina.com/video/2024/05/09/severe-weather-causes-major-damage-anderson-county-man-dies-after-colliding-with-tree-laurens-county/), downed powerlines causing [thousands of outages](https://www.foxcarolina.com/2024/05/08/thousands-outages-reported-severe-storms-roll-through-western-carolinas/), a [roof ripped off a building](https://www.foxcarolina.com/2024/05/09/live-roof-down-front-city-hall-downtown-anderson/) downtown, and [more](https://www.foxcarolina.com/2024/05/08/photos-storm-damage-happening-upstate/). “It was really a complex of storms, brought a lot of straight-line, damaging winds,” Meteorologist Clay Chaney with the NWS said. “Sometimes in those environments, you can get spin-outs along that line.” So far, the team assessing the damage in the city limits of Anderson has only found evidence of damage from straight-line winds. The NWS said they believe the winds reached up to 75 miles per hour. The survey will continue into Belton, Honea Path, and possibly into Laurens County. Lori Dozier, who lives in Honea Path, captured video of a [funnel cloud over her home](https://www.foxcarolina.com/2024/05/09/watch-funnel-cloud-caught-camera-upstate/) on Carolina Avenue around 2 a.m. Thursday. It is not yet clear if the funnel cloud touched down. Stay with FOX Carolina for updates on this developing story. Copyright 2024 WHNS. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Hubballi: As the mercury level rises and the heat waves persist, residents of the twin cities, Hubballi and Dharwad, are grappling with worsening drinking water shortages. Recent protests in some areas of Hubballi City reflect growing frustration with authorities and service providers like L&T, responsible for water supply.Presently, the Malaprabha reservoir holds 4.67 TMC of live storage, providing a potential two-month reprieve. However, prolonged rain delays and unchecked water waste could worsen the situation. The twin cities rely on a daily supply of 245 MLD, sourced primarily from the Malaprabha reservoir (220 MLD) and Neerasagar (20 MLD). Neerasagar's water serves 22 wards in the Old Hubballi area.E Thimmappa, superintending engineer, KUIDFC and also HDMC, said that currently, there is sufficient water available at Malaprabha Reservoir. To supply of water for Hubballi-Dharwad for the next two months, there is a requirement of 0.5 TMC water. Currently, there is live storage of enough water available in the reservoir. “If rain is delayed even after two months, we will have to worry about water scarcity,” he said. He also said that before the situation gets worse, people should start using water carefully, without wasting it. Many people use water to wash vehicles. If people join hands with the authorities, then Hubballi-Dharwad will be able to have a water supply uninterruptedly.Ramesh S, a social activist, said that the civic authorities should take appropriate measures to avoid a water crisis. People should also stop using water for washing vehicles, gardening etc. “The authorities should be prepared with alternative arrangements,” he added.Sources in HDMC said its officers have discussed with the officials of HDMC, KUIDFC, L&T and others regarding the availability of water in reservoirs and other issues related to water supply.The L&T, which takes care of the water supply in twin cities, also chalks out the strategies to supply water in the areas of 24/7 water zones. The L&T officials are working out plans to provide service uninterruptedly. For a smooth supply of water in 24X7 water zones, the officials plan not to keep the pipelines empty. If once the 24X7 pipeline dried then the whole water supply system may get affected, added sources.

    "text": "NASA has issued a warning regarding four asteroids currently hurtling towards Earth. Although this news may sound alarming, let's examine the details to determine if there is any cause for concern. All four asteroids are classified under the Apollo group, known for occasionally intersecting Earth's orbit. Here's a closer look at each of them:Firstly, there's Asteroid 2024 JV6, measuring a relatively modest 26 feet in size. It's travelling at a staggering speed of 42,081 kilometers per hour and is set to make its closest approach to Earth on May 10th at 21:58 UTC, coming within 595,000 kilometres of our planet.Next up is Asteroid 2024 JK1, slightly larger at 58 feet. This member of the Apollo group is speeding up, moving at 43,472 kilometres per hour. However, it will pass by Earth on May 10th at a distance of approximately 1.6 million kilometres.Following closely behind is Asteroid 2021 JG9, measuring 100 feet in size. While it's not the largest of the group, its speed of 48,247 kilometres per hour indicates swift movement. Keep an eye out on May 10th when it approaches within 4 million kilometres of Earth.Lastly, we have Asteroid 2024 JF8, with a substantial diameter of 73 feet. This asteroid is hurtling through space at an impressive speed of 90,056 kilometres per hour. Fortunately, it will pass by Earth at a safe distance of 4 million kilometres on May 10th at 14:49.Are We Going To Die?Before jumping to conclusions, yes.Now, let's gain some perspective. While the sizes and speeds of these asteroids may seem intimidating, their closest approaches to Earth remain relatively distant. The closest any of them will get is 595,000 kilometres away â€“ a distance greater than that of the Moon!It's crucial to remember that NASA continuously monitors near-Earth objects like these. The Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) diligently observes all known asteroids, evaluating any potential impact risks they may pose. By utilizing data from observatories worldwide, including contributions from amateur astronomers and NASA-funded projects, scientists can accurately track these celestial bodies and predict their trajectories.So, should you be worried? In this instance, there's no need to panic. While it's fascinating to witness these cosmic phenomena, they do not pose an immediate threat to Earth. Thanks to the vigilant surveillance efforts of organizations like NASA, we can be confident that our planet is well-guarded against any interstellar surprises.",

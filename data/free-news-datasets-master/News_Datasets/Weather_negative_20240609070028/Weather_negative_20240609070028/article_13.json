    "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WTXL) â€” After a lull in storm development early Friday, stormy conditions will return to the Florida/Georgia line region before sunrise. Storm action in central Alabama will gradually move southeast through early Friday morning. At the same time, a developing complex of intense thunderstorms will traverse the landscape in central Louisiana, southern Mississippi, and Alabama, arriving in our tri-state area before sunrise. These are projected to have an effect on more of the state line and northern Florida parts of our region. Broad-reaching damaging wind gusts are a primary risk. Wind gusts near and north of I-10 can reach a peak of 75 mph, causing considerable damage potential in affected areas. Some portions of the storm complex will produce hail. An outlying chance for brief tornadoes also exists with this system. A severe thunderstorm watch covers sections of southwest Georgia along the Chattahoochee River, with Early County being in closest proximity to our region. A separate severe thunderstorm or tornado watch may be necessary for local counties during the morning time frame. Showers and storms will straggle around and south of I-10 through midday and the afternoon hours. They won't be as organized or widespread but can still cause downpours, lightning, and localized wind gusts. The cold front contributing to all this activity will slip south of the coast Friday night, allowing for a drier weekend with slightly cooler temperatures.",

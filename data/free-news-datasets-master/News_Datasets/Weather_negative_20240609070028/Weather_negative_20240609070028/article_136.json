The heavy downpour also affected domestic flight services after water leakage in terminal-2 of the KIA. Several main roads were under water, prompting police to redirect traffic to alternative routes. Slow-moving traffic was reported due to waterlogging on Chowdiah Road towards High Grounds Junction and on Ballari Road towards Hebbal due to waterlogging at Sanjaynagar Cross.

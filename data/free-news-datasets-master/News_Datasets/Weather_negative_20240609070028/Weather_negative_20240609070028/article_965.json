    "text": "At least six tornadoes hit Tennessee this week, destroying homes, flooding roads and killing two people , and the National Weather Service expects to identify more as damage assessments continue Friday. \"We know that there are other tornadoes from yesterday,\" the weather service said in a social media post Thursday, announcing plans for crews to continue surveys Friday. Preliminary reports from three confirmed Wednesday tornadoes were released late Thursday. Information from a fourth touchdown, in Giles County, was released Friday . Here are the details: Columbia tornado path: What path did the tornado in Columbia, Tennessee take? Weather service crews out looking at damage path Columbia, TN tornado In Columbia, an EF-3 with 140 mph winds that was half a mile wide traveled 11 miles, the weather service said. The tornado touched down at about 5:37 p.m. east of the city near Loftin Road and continued for about 30 minutes before it lifted near Flat Creek in Spring Hill. \"Multiple homes received damage along Cothran Rd and Cranford Hollow Rd before the tornado moved north of Highway 412,\" the weather service wrote in a public statement on the tornadoes. \"More intense damage began to occur on Old Highway 99 and Blackburn Lane where large sections of roofs were removed and hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted.\" It was on Blackburn Lane where the tornado reached maximum strength. Cheryl Lovett was killed when her mobile home was swept away. Penny Lovett, who was in the home with Cheryl, was critically injured and flown to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for care. Three other people suffered non-life-threatening injuries, Maury Regional Medical Center said. Rutherford County, TN tornado About an hour after the Columbia tornado, an EF-0 with winds of 80 mph touched down in Eagleville and traveled just under 3 miles to Bell Buckle. \"The tornado moved east along New Zion Rd snapping large branches off from hardwood trees,\" the weather service wrote in the statement. \"Trees were uprooted near the intersection of Midland Rd and Jones Rd. The tornado continued east along Jones Rd snapping large limbs and uprooting a few trees before the tornado transitioned to straight line winds near the Gray Fox neighborhood.\" Storm related injuries: Rutherford Schools director shares new details about injured son, 'damage is substantial' Robertson County tornado The weather service identified a third tornado, an EF-1 at speeds of 90 mph, in Robertson County near Springfield. No specific details about that storm have been released as of Friday morning. On Wednesday, social media posts showed the tornado over homes, though no tornado-specific damage reports were released during the day. There were some reports in Robertson County, and photos, that showed downed trees that had landed on homes. Giles County, TN tornado On Friday, the weather service posted that it had identified a fourth tornado from Wednesday's outbreak, in Prospect, Tennessee out of Giles County. The EF-2 had winds of 115 mph and was 600 yards wide. It traveled about 5.7 miles and stopped just west of Interstate 65, the service said. One person was critically injured as a result of the tornado. No fatalities were reported, and no other details were released as of press time for this story. Earlier on Wednesday, in East Tennessee, a 22-year-old man was killed in Claiborne County when a tree fell on his car, emergency officials there told USA TODAY. On Monday, two tornadoes hit the Volunteer State, the weather service confirmed. Survey crews identified an EF-0 in Wilson County about eight miles northeast of Lebanon along Big Spring Road, just north of Old Rome Pike. The only known damage was to trees, meteorologists said. Winds reached about 70 mph and it traveled about half a mile. An EF-1 tornado also touched down Monday afternoon in DeKalb County and traveled about 3.3 miles at 100 mph, the weather service said. No injuries were reported in either of the Monday storms.",

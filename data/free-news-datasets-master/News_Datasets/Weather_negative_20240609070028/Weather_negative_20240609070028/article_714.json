Upon attempting to touch down, the pilot opted to divert to Belfast International Airport after an initial attempt proved unsuccessful, an investigation revealed.\nREAD MORE: Daredevil Edinburgh granny, 87, takes on hair-raising 160ft high zip line\nREAD MORE: Budget airline to launch first Edinburgh flights to popular holiday destination\nAir Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) submitted a report following the second failed attempt at landing and subsequent damage of the aircraft as no injuries were reported onboard and the plane later touched down without incident at Belfast International Airport.\nA description of the damage said: \"The operator reported that the nosewheel tyres were damaged and when the wheels were removed, the left nosewheel axle was slightly bent.\nSign up for Edinburgh Live newsletters for more headlines straight to your inbox\n\"The flight data showed an acceleration of approximately 2.2 g in the normal axis when the aircraft contacted the runway before the go-around. The aircraft manufacturer assessed that the left main landing gear and the nose landing gear had both experienced loads beyond their allowable limits and required replacement before the aircraft could be returned into service.\n\"The landing gear sustained damage during a heavy touch down after the aircraft became destabilised, due to wind effects experienced during the flare, immediately before touchdown.\"\nJoin Edinburgh Live's Whatsapp Community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.",

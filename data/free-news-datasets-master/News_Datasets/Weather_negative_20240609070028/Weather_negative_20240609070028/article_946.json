Solar Dynamics Observatory hide caption\ntoggle caption Solar Dynamics Observatory\nNASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured this image of solar flares early Saturday afternoon. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says there have been measurable effects and impacts from the geomagnetic storm.\nSolar Dynamics Observatory Planet Earth is getting rocked by the biggest solar storm in decades – and the potential effects have those people in charge of power grids, communications systems and satellites on edge.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says there have been measurable effects and impacts from the geomagnetic storm that has been visible as aurora across vast swathes of the Northern Hemisphere. So far though, NOAA has seen no reports of major damage.\nThe Picture Show Photos: See the Northern lights from rare, solar storm There has been some degradation and loss to communication systems that rely on high-frequency radio waves, NOAA told NPR, as well as some preliminary indications of irregularities in power systems.\n\"Simply put, the power grid operators have been busy since yesterday working to keep proper, regulated current flowing without disruption,\" said Shawn Dahl, service coordinator for the Boulder, Co.-based Space Weather Prediction Center at NOAA.\nShort Wave NOAA Issues First Severe Geomagnetic Storm Watch Since 2005 NOAA Issues First Severe Geomagnetic Storm Watch Since 2005 Listen · 13:29 13:29 Toggle more options Download Embed Embed < iframe src=\"https://www.npr.org/player/embed/1198916193/1250568501\" width=\"100%\" height=\"290\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"NPR embedded audio player\">",

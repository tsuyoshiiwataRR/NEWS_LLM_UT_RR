    "text": "Wind, hail & tornado reports over the past few days have been extremely numerous in what has been a violent 2-week period that began in the Plains & then shifted eastward more. We have seen three main tornado/severe outbreak sequences from the Plains to the Midwest in these two weeks. Confirmed tornado count for Indiana on Tuesday is preliminarily at 7. Surveys are on-going & more will likely be added. In addition, some may be confirmed from yesterday-last night over the southern part of the state. Tuesday-Friday rainfall totals will be in the next blog post tomorrow once all of the data is gathered. A few isolated showers are expected Friday (highs 63-68) with lots of cumulus clouds & sun, followed by a wave of some scattered showers Friday night/Saturday morning near 12 a.m. to 4 a.m. time frame. Lows will run lows 49-53. After a break with a lot of sun, cumulus clouds rapidly bubble up & a few scattered showers/t'showers will bubble up with the cold air aloft Saturday afternoon-evening (highs 63-71 [coolest northeast, warmest southwest]). Saturday will be a windy day with northwest winds 15-23 mph gusting 30-40 mph. Sunday is the best day with sunshine, just a few clouds & 73-78 (after 42-46 in the morning). It will be a breezy to windy day, however, with west to southwest winds 15-30 mph. Some scattered showers & storms are possible later in the day from the northwest Monday with south-southwest winds 20-35 mph. Highs of 77-81 are expected with increasing clouds (after morning lows in the 50s). Severe weather risk is setting up mainly west & southwest of our viewing area (up to SLIGHT RISK parameters seen with pocket of ENHANCED possible in Texas). Scattered showers & storms are expected Tuesday with mostly cloudy skies & highs 71-76 (with southeast to east winds 15-25 mph). The severe weather risk (up to SLIGHT RISK its appears) should set up south of our area. Showers are possible Wednesday morning, then they push out, followed by some clearing & highs (with northwest winds) 67-73. MARGINAL to SLIGHT RISK parameters would be over the Carolinas & Florida with SLIGHT to ENHANCED scenario over northwestern to northern Texas. Wave of showers & storms passes Thursday afternoon-evening. Parameters suggest MARGINAL to low-end SLIGHT RISK here. Bigger risk is in the Deep South of the U.S. Highs Thursday of 77-81 are expected. Scattered showers & a few storms may linger into Friday & even next Saturday morning with highs in the 60s to around 70. Severe weather risk will reside from the Carolinas to Florida. TOTAL RAINFALL MAY 10-18 looks to run 1-2.25\". We then dry out with one cooler day of highs 60s & lows 40s before climbing back to highs in the 70s & 80s. Overall drier trend should occur thereafter. This post-May 18 midday graphic shows the hot ridge building in the Plains that is set to bring us Summer heat & our first 90 of the year in late May. The final system may pass around May 27 with brief severe weather risk as a broken line of storms with that heat. If analog is correct, this would be a bigger severe threat & the biggest threat since May 7 with ENHANCED or greater parameters. Potential is there for a brief, potent cool-down for a bit with highs in the 60s to 70 & lows in the 40s (normal at that time: 75-78/52-56). June looks hotter & drier than normal here, but random Serial Derecho or big severe event may still occur. Heat wave is likely during the month. Flash drought conditions still may evolve. July looks hotter & drier than normal with risk of random Serial Derecho side-swiping our area. Flash drought conditions are still expected. August looks hotter than normal & especially muggy with +80 dew points on multiple days. It appears increasingly likely that tropical remnants will impact our area & bring a couple heavy rainfall events. This may drive our monthly total above normal, but there will be big dry stretches during the month. As the hot, dry ridge overtops those wet soils, we set the stage for the highest heat indices of the Summer at +115. Peak July-August temperatures should run 99-104 with peak heat indices 115-122. This hurricane season looks very active & intense with potential near record number of storms & very high ACE Index reminiscent of 2004 & 2005. We are headed rapidly to La Nina, possibly evolving into a La Nina Modoki. Strength looks moderate at this point by Winter, then La Nina becomes neutral by early- to mid-Summer of 2025. Modoki would imply better potential of intense Arctic, Polar Vortex intrusion this Winter. However, there are many other players on the court. +IOD may tamper the La Nina & keep it from exceeding lower-end Moderate level, while -PDO with Marine Heat Wave expanding eastward in the Pacific may keep it from going Strong, as well. The colder Aleutian, Bering & Sea of Okhotsk water combined with warm Greenland to Iceland water may allow slippage into +PNA & -NAO, -AO combos at times, leading to a couple big Arctic events amidst wide, wide, mild temperature swings. However, the +EPO of the MHW in the Pacific will also blend in wind & big warmth with dry periods. The warm west Atlantic & Gulf with La Nina ridging in the Southeast with dryness support warm surges way above normal. Overall, it will be a wild ride of big, big swings with active storm track & perhaps even a random bomb cyclone in our area. So let's begin with September Trend is for very active September for the tropics with landfalls. September looks to end up a bit wetter than normal, especially given tropical influence & a slightly more southerly storm track (though it is usually not too active in September, climatologically-speaking here). Exception to usually less-active storm track overall is 1866 & 2003 with heavy rains & storms in our area frequently. Usually, if your September is wetter or especially wet, it is tied to the tropics. New trend is also for temperatures to average near normal for the month. October is warmer & drier than normal, followed by above normal precipitation in November & an early winter-like cold snap mid to late month with even some accumulating snowfall. It appears that Summer-like hot weather may occur last deep into October with Bermuda high & upper ridging in the East & Northeast. This would also bring endless Summer to New England after cooler weather in September. So, we could very well have a stint at some near/record warm 80-85 weather for a few days in late October. December is overall colder than normal with above normal precipitation & above normal snowfall, though the early half of December looks more wintry than the late part of the month. It could literally snow on Thanksgiving, but Christmas may end up mild, damp & foggy. I went for above normal precipitation in January & February with below normal snowfall in January, but above normal snowfall in February & one +6\" snowfall viewing area-wide. The risk of a couple rounds of substantial river & flash flooding will be elevated November to February as well. Winter looks windier than normal with much wider than normal temperature swings & big drops & rises in surface air pressure. Random severe storm event is possible in November, even perhaps January &/or February. There will be times when the Arctic air absolutely dumps into our area with a good snowpack & it is blowing & drifting everywhere, then it is 60 a week later with thunder & southwest winds gusting +50 mph. December-January-February shows the consistent above normal precipitation trend. Overall, northwest half of the U.S. overall looks colder than normal this Winter with above normal temperatures in the eastern & southeastern U.S. Given the very wide swings in temperature, it will likely all even out to temperatures slightly above normal. We will be in-between the cold in the Northwest U.S. & Northern Plains to western Corn Belt & warmth in the East & Southeast to Southern Plains. Very strong jet overall, big swings & a bomb cyclone thrown in will make for a wild ride.",

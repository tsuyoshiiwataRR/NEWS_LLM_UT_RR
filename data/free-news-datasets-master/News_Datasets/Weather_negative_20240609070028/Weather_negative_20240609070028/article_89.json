    "text": "Several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the sun will impact the Earth late on May 10th. Their merger could bring an intense geomagnetic storm, leading to widespread aurora. A G4 watch has been issued as a result. The reason this is particularly rare is the majority of events are classified as G1-G3. This is also the first G4 watch since 2005. G4 & G5 storms are incredibly infrequent, but when they happen, the chances of aurora skyrocket. According to NOAA, aurora may be visible over much of the northern half of the US. If it is as intense as currently predicted, the northern lights could be seen as far south as Alabama & northern California. For us in Mid-Michigan, we typically need a G2 or G3 storm to see the aurora on the horizon/overhead. Even if this storm ends up being a bit weaker, aurora would still be possible here. However, having a G4 storm would give us a really good chance to see the northern lights. Impacts to the power grid, satellites, and radio signals could also happen during a G4 storm. The biggest question with this opportunity is if Mother Nature will even allow us to see it. Currently, the forecast does have quite a bit of cloud cover in the area. While this would block the aurora at times, there should be enough breaks to still see some colors. The strongest portion of the storm is expected between 11 PM & 2 AM. This is also when skies will be opening up a bit before more clouds develop late. As always, the further north you go, the better your chances will be. Make sure you get away from any light pollution and look up and to the north.",

Safety measures have been implemented, including the closure of areas prone to incidents like road collapses. The BBMP has set up a 24-hour helpline, urging citizens to report emergencies. Zone-wise helpline numbers have been provided for residents to seek assistance.\nVinaykumar Patil First Published May 10, 2024, 11:52 AM IST Follow Bengaluru, which had been under the sunâ€™s spell over the past few months, has recently experienced relentless rain showers, causing chaos across the city. Over the past week, Rain Raya has been a frequent visitor to Bengaluru, bringing much-needed relief from the scorching heat. However, this respite came at a cost as heavy rainfall lashed the city from Monday through Thursday, causing significant disruptions to daily life.\nThe downpour resulted in more than 20 trees and branches collapsing, blocking roads and causing traffic snarls. Major thoroughfares were submerged, with waterlogging reported in several areas including the Okalipura underbridge, Kaveri Junction underbridge, and Mysore Road overbridge. Commuters making their way home after work found themselves stranded amidst the deluge, exacerbating the already congested traffic situation.\nBESCOM launches WhatsApp numbers for quicker resolution of electrical issues in 8 districts\nIn response to safety concerns, authorities have taken precautionary measures, particularly in areas prone to incidents such as road collapses.

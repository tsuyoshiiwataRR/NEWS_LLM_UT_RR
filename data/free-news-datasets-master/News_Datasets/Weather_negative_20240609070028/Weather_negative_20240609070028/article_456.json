    "text": "Otters Drop Season Opener After Lengthy Weather Delay\nMay 9, 2024 -\nFrontier League (FL)\nEvansville Otters News Release\nCRESTWOOD, IL - The Evansville Otters suffered a 2024 Opening Day loss to the Windy City Thunderbolts on Thursday, May 9 at Ozinga Field. Damage was done early, with the Otters (0-1) plating five runs in the top of the first inning, but late lightning brought the Thunderbolts (1-0) back in the ninth.\nPlay was delayed an hour and twenty-three minutes due to rain in the Crestwood area.\nThe first two batters of the game, Patrick Lee and Austin Bost, walked to put runners on first and second. Mike Peabody kept the train moving with an RBI double to right-center field, giving Evansville its first run of the 2024 season.\nJomar Reyes then reached on an error to the shortstop, bringing in another run. Later, Joe Burke notched a two-RBI single through the right side to make it a 4-0 game. The final run of the frame came on a bases-loaded walk from Lee, scoring Mason House.\nThe offense sputtered throughout the rest of the game and could not find the scoreboard again.\nZach Smith was tabbed with the start. The right-hander was sharp on the mound, tossing 6.0 innings of one run ball. He surrendered just three hits with no walks and eight strikeouts.\nThree relievers came out of the bullpen. Jon Beymer saw just two batters before being taken out due to injury. James Krick gave up one run in the seventh frame, making it a 5-2 game.\nIn the bottom of the ninth, Leoni De La Cruz toed the rubber. After getting the first man out on one pitch, the lefty specialist allowed bases loaded with two outs, marking the winning run on first.\nRonnie Allen Jr., who came in as a defensive replacement in the top of the frame, smacked a bases-clearing triple to right-center for the walk-off win. On the play, Lee and Peabody collided in the outfield, allowing the ball to roll away.\nDe La Cruz received the loss and a blown save.\nLee reached base four times, going 1-for-2 with three walks, a run and an RBI. Leading the offense with a pair of knocks was Justin Felix, and Burke tallied two RBIs, leading in that department.\nEvansville will begin their weekend series against Joliet tomorrow at 6:35 p.m. CT. Coverage available on FloSports and the Otters Digital Network.\nThe Evansville Otters are the 2006 and 2016 Frontier League champions.\nThe Otters play all home games at historic Bosse Field, located at 23 Don Mattingly Way in Evansville, Ind.

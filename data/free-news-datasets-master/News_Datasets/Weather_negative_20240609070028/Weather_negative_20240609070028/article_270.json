Especially when it hit the top of the windshield, you could see the glass start to shatter everywhere,” said medic Lydia Torres.\nStreaming 24/7: Watch NBC 5 local news and weather for free wherever you are\nTorres and her partner were on a call when they were sent scrambling for cover from stones as large as the palm of their hands.\n“It looks like a paintball hit him in the back of his shoulder blades,” she said.\nGet DFW local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox.

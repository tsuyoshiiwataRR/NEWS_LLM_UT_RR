    "text": "From: Christina Erne, Storm Team 10 Meteorologist: We continue to be stuck in an unsettled weather pattern with cooler than usual temperatures taking us through the weekend. Today, highs reach the upper 50s with a few light spotty showers through at least mid-morning, clearing by afternoon, but leaving us mainly cloudy. Below normal temperatures and mainly cloudy skies remain in place all weekend long with a low risk of a shower each day. Breaks of sun here or there are possible Saturday, and after a few showers pass the Cape by mid-morning, drier skies can take over. A few isolated showers are possible for Mother's Day, although more dry skies are expected than wet.

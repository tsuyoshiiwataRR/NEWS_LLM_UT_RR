    "text": "SEGUIN, Texas â€” Emergency crews in Guadalupe County are starting to canvass communities that were hit hard by severe weather Thursday night.\nLocal officials said they had received reports of trees toppled onto cars and roofs blown off some structures. At one point more than 1,000 households and businesses were without power; as of 10:50 a.m., that number stood at 325 as crews continued responding to damaged or downed power lines.\nNo injuries have been reported as a result of the storms, which swept through Redwood, Staples and San Marcos.\n\"Today we're going to start canvassing the area and start doing damage assessments,\" said Patrick Pinder, fire marshal and emergency management coordinator for Guadalupe County, adding that some impacted areas are stricken by poverty. \"There's going to be a lot of homes that are uninsured in that community.\"\nPinder says Guadalupe Residents affected by the storms can contact the emergency management office at emc1@co.guadalupe.tx.us.\nThe Red Cross is also providing temporary shelter to anyone who needs it. Residents can call 1-800-733-2767 for more information.\nThis is a developing story.\n>MORE LOCAL NEWS:",

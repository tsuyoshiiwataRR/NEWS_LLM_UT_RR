    "text": "In Dinajpur, a northern district of Bangladesh renowned for lychee cultivation, the ongoing heatwave poses a significant threat to this season's lychee yield. Initially, the lychee trees showcased a promising start with ample budding. However, the excessive heat has led to premature falling of the small lychees. While the Bombay variety remains relatively unaffected, around half of the Bedena, Madrasi, China Three, and Kathali lychee crops are at risk. Despite the challenges, farmers are exploring various methods to salvage the harvest. Mosaddek Hossain, a local orchard owner and honey producer from lychees, highlighted the adverse effects of the strong sunshine and heatwave on the crops, stating, \"The lychee seeds are falling from the trees due to the strong sunshine and the heatwave. Even with irrigation, the yield cannot be saved. If this situation persists, we won't produce even half the amount of lychees this time.\" Nonetheless, the Bombay variety has shown resilience, benefiting from early budding and timely rainfall, resulting in a satisfactory harvest. Last year, Dinajpur enjoyed a fruitful lychee season, but the current climatic conditions have introduced uncertainties. Imran Ahsan from the Dinajpur Horticulture Centre acknowledged the potential for a productive season had been compromised by the heat. The district's Agriculture Extension Department reports that lychee cultivation spans 5,500 hectares this year, with an anticipated production of approximately 30,000 tons.

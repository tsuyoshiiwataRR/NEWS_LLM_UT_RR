    "text": "LEWISTOWN, Mont. â€” Fergus County received a one-two weather punch for its residents earlier this week. A spring storm hit Tuesday, bringing snow and high winds. The storm impacted several areas in Fergus Electric Cooperative, Inc's service area, resulting in more than 50 broken poles, and multiple downed power lines, according to a Facebook post by Fergus Electric Cooperative, Inc. On Wednesday, Fergus Electric Cooperative, Inc. notified its users, saying people could be without power for an extended period of time as conditions were impacting repairs. \"Visibility is poor and in several areas the snow is deep, wet, and heavy, making it difficult for the line crews to get access to the outage sites to make repairs,\" wrote Fergus Electric Cooperative, Inc. On Thursday, Fergus Electric Cooperative, Inc. deployed the helicopter outage patrol team for an aerial assessment. Fergus Electric Cooperative, Inc, expects repairs to take up to a week, as line crews are now facing flooding from melting snow. Fergus Electric Cooperative, Inc. released the following information:",

    "text": "ELLIJAY, Ga. â€” Preliminary results from a National Weather Service survey in Ellijay on Friday show EF-1 tornado damage in the area. Ellijay and the wider Gilmer County area were hit especially hard as storms [swept through the area](/article/weather/severe-weather-updates-atlanta/85-37818b8b-010f-4dce-804c-3999fc61cfa9) late Wednesday night and early Thursday morning. An EF-1 tornado would mean max winds of 90-100 miles per hour impacted the area. The 11Alive SkyTracker flew over the scene on Friday, showing buildings with walls and roofs blown away, trailers that had been completely wrecked and large trees that had fallen. The National Weather Service crew will continue to survey the Ellijay area and will also at some point observe Walker County, where it was possible a tornado touched down. News happens fast.

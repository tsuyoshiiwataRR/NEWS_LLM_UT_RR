    "text": "Two tornadoes were confirmed to have touched down a minute apart in Randolph County during the early morning storms Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. No injuries were reported. The first tornado, an EF-1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale , touched down west of County Road 2160 at 1:43 a.m. and lifted near Moberly at 1:56 a.m., according to the NWS. It reached speeds of 90 miles per hour and had a length of 8.65 miles. The tornado damaged and downed trees along its path, also downing several power lines and poles and causing damage to homes and barns.It also destroyed a water tank, blowing part of its remnants 100 yards to the northeast. The second tornado, an EF-0, developed just southwest of Higbee at 1:44 a.m. and caused damage to a large part of the town's southern portion, the NWS reported. It had a length of 2.06 miles, lifting near County Road 2560 northeast of town at 1:47 a.m. Most of the tornadoes' damage was limited to trees. Several large trees were downed, with some falling onto property causing damage to cars and residences along Route A. It also displaced a car several feet in a parking lot and blew a trailer into a business property, which had significant roof damage. Two tornadoes were reported in the Kansas City area and three tornadoes in the St. Louis area, all of them resulting from the same group of storms.",

    "text": "NEW ORLEANS â€” Rare solar storms could impact technology in The United States and project the northern lights over unusual locations throughout the country Friday night, according to scientists. The flares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections which shoot plasma and magnetic field from the outer atmosphere of the sun. This phenomenon is rare and has historically caused brief navigation issues and power grid problems. \"They label these things like they do hurricanes -- from one to five -- they're labeling this one a G4 Watch,\" WWL Louisiana Meteorologist Payton Malone said Friday. \"The last time they issued a G4 Watch was 2005.\" The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said they had been monitoring the flares since Wednesday morning when at least five flares appeared to have been directed toward Earth. The NOAA outlined on Thursday the impact these storms can have. \"Geomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth's surface, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operations,\" NOAA said on Thursday. \"Geomagnetic storms can also trigger spectacular displays of aurora on Earth.\" Louisiana will likely not see the aurora borealis lights. Although the National Weather Service has said that half the United States might be able to see the northern lights, including possibly Alabama and northern California. In addition, almost all of Canada will be placed within view of the aurora. The 2003 Halloween Storms in Sweden were cited by NOAA as a recent example of a solar storm having an impact on Earth. During that cycle, most of Sweden had a one-hour-long power outage.",

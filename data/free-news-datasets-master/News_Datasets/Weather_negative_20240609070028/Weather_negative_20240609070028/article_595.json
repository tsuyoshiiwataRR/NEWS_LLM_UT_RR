    "text": "Power out throughout the city; Outage map shows 60,000 customers in the dark A short and furious storm knocked out power to more than 60,000 people in Tallahassee, according to the city's power outage map. That number rivals what the city sees during hurricane strikes or near-misses. [Sudden tornado warning sends parents and school district scrambling] The Tallahassee area is under tornado warnings as severe storms with rotating winds roar across the Big Bend. One tornado warning for northwestern Wakulla County and Leon County is in effect until 7:30 a.m. At 6:50 a.m., tornadic storms were located along a line extending from Midway to 14 miles southwest of Tallahassee. \"DANGEROUS SITUATION UNFOLDING FOR #TALLAHASSEE right now. SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY! Multiple circulations and Radar-confirmed tornadoes apparent on Radar. #FLwx ,\" the weather service posted on X. The storms blew up at the same time Leon County High School parents were getting their kids to school. A school district spokesperson advised parents that tardies and absences would be excused and to stay off the roads until conditions are safe. One teacher at Leon High sent an alert to students saying \"there is no power at school. Do not drive in the storm.\" Many South Georgia school districts closed in advance of the storm, but Tallahassee was listed in a lower risk area by forecasters. \"ALL LCS Busses will be delaying pick up for elementary and middle school until the severe weather passes through our area,\" the district tweeted. \"Please monitor your email and our social media for updates. Our buses are parking at all the high schools to stay in place at this time.\" The Weather Channel's Jim Cantore tweeted radar of what he said were two radar-indicated tornadoes in the Tallahassee area. The tornado warning is set to end at 7:30 a.m. while a sever thunderstom warning remains until 7:45 a.m.",

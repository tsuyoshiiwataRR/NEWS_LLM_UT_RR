    "text": "[](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/cash-transfers-in-andhra-pradesh-stopped-by-high-court-until-voting-on-monday/story) Bengaluru airport's T2 sees water leakage after heavy rainfall [Bengaluru](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/bengaluru/bengaluru)'s Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) Terminal 2 (T2) experienced water leakage due to heavy rainfall on Thursday. The rainwater was seen dripping from the roof near the baggage claim area, forming a puddle near the conveyor belt. The [Bangalore International Airport Limited](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/bengaluru/bangalore-international-airport-limited) (BIAL), which operates KIA, confirmed that their teams responded quickly to restore normal operations and expressed regret for any inconvenience caused to passengers. BIAL's response to the water leakage incident In response to the incident, BIAL issued a statement saying, \"A very heavy downpour of rain within a short span of time on the evening of May 9, 2024, resulted in water leakage in certain areas of the terminals at Bengaluru airport\". They added that their teams acted promptly to mitigate the impact and restore normal operations. Watch: Bengaluru airport roof leaks Heavy rainfall results in flight diversions Due to the heavy rains and low visibility, 17 Bengaluru-bound flights were diverted to [Chennai](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/chennai). A BIAL spokesperson confirmed that these included 13 domestic flights, three international passenger flights, and one international cargo flight. The spokesperson explained that \"Heavy rainfall accompanied by strong winds rendered the airport inaccessible for landings between 9:35pm and 10:30pm, leading to the diversion of flights.\" The affected domestic airlines included IndiGo, [Air India](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/business/air-india), Air India Express, Vistara, and Star Air. Heavy rainfall causes traffic disruptions in Bengaluru The heavy rain also caused severe inconvenience to airport-bound passengers due to waterlogged roads. The Bengaluru traffic police reported waterlogging from Chalukya Circle to Hebbal flyover and at Hunasamaranahalli. An advisory issued by the traffic police on Thursday warned commuters of a potential 30 to 40-minute delay to the airport due to heavy congestion and slow-moving traffic on both sides of the flooded roads.",

    "text": "With heavy rain forecast across several regions this weekend, the NSW State Emergency Service (SES) is urging residents to take proactive measures to ensure their safety and minimise potential damage to property. From Friday and over the weekend, eastern parts of the state will likely see heavy rain, which could lead to flooding in a number of areas due to already saturated catchments. The heaviest rain is predicted to fall in the Illawarra and South Coast, with isolated heavy rain up to 200 millimeters possible from Saturday afternoon into Sunday afternoon. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a flood watch for minor riverine flooding in the Hawkesbury Nepean Valley and South Coast from Saturday. NSW SES Assistant Commissioner Nicole Hogan, said the main risk associated with the forecast was flash flooding, but minor riverine rises were possible. \"We're closely monitoring the weather and are prepared to respond swiftly to any emergencies that may arise,\" Assistant Commissioner Hogan said. \"Our teams are on standby, and we have prepositioned people and assets to assist the community and mitigate the impacts of heavy rainfall. \"Flash flooding can occur rapidly and without warning, posing a significant risk to life and property. People should where possible, stay indoors during heavy rainfall and avoid driving or walking through floodwaters.\" People can prepare their homes and assist NSW SES volunteers by ensuring their gutters and drains are cleared ahead of storms and heavy rainfall. \"By cleaning your gutters ahead of rain, you can prevent damage to your properties,\" Assistant Commissioner Hogan said. \"Other ways residents can prepare for storms include securing loose outdoor items, having an emergency kit that includes essential items and downloading the Hazards Near Me app to stay informed.\" For assistance during floods and storms, contact the NSW SES on 132 500. In life-threatening emergencies, dial Triple Zero (000). [here](/east-coast-warned-by-nsw-ses-prepare-for-heavy-1232341/).",

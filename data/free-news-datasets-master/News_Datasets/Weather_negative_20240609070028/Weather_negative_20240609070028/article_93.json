    "text": "FIRST ALERT WEATHER | When is the rain after today? Last First Alert Weather Day today, but not the last of the rain (WSAZ) - A new area of low pressure has formed over regions to the north of our viewing area (near I-70). This has developed yet another front in that general area, with a warm moist airmass setting up shop to the south of those fronts and that low pressure today. This means that, once again, the region will be under the gun for strong storms capable of gusty winds, with a localized hail and very small but present tornado threat for this afternoon as well. Most of this activity should be confined to areas north of I-64, with a few spokes of energy as the initiating factors for these storms. As the front sags to the south, the last round of storms will push their way on through during the late evening and early overnight hours of today and tonight. Lingering moisture will squeeze out a few more showers overnight tonight into Friday morning, before cold air working in will allow for sinking motion, and therefore drier conditions for the afternoon and evening hours of Friday (with the exception of the mountains seeing a bit of lingering activity). With the cold air working in, temperatures will fall back into the 60s. Yet another system will begin working its way on through the region for the day on Saturday, driving a quick hitting round of storms during the middle of the day. Luckily, we’re not expecting any flooding or severe weather for the weekend. Another piece of good news? We’re looking at dry conditions after this round of storms, as the region will see sunshine and much better weather for the day on Sunday (with high pressure working on in). This high pressure kicks eastward on Monday, allowing southerly flow to develop, allowing us to see warmer temperatures (along with the sunshine as well). However, this nice stretch is not expected to last for too long. The next system quickly moves in Monday night, lasting through Wednesday, and developing more rain and rumbles into the area during this time. We’re at least not expecting any severe weather to develop in the region, which is nice, but it will still be a bit of a pain dealing with the rain for the middle of next week.

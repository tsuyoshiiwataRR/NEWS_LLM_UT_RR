    "text": "By Douglas McIntyre ,\n1 hour ago\nTemperatures are 100 degrees F in south Texas, and this trend is expected to continue through mid-summer and spread to New Mexico as well. According to the National Weather Service, both are forecast at “above” seasonal temperatures through July. Seasonal temperatures are normally in the 90s at this time of year.\nRenewables Challenge –Growth Is Too Slow\nThese above-normal temperature levels could bring levels similar to those in Phoenix last year, where the mercury rose to over 110 degrees F for 51 days. In August last year, the temperature reached 106 degrees F in San Antonio and was over 100 degrees on several days.\nDangerous Outdoor Work\nOne of the economic issues with dangerously high temperatures is that productivity suffers, particularly in sectors where people have to work part of the day outdoors.\nThe other effect is a strain on the grid. Texas has been notorious for grid breakdowns recently, and most of the infrastructure problems that caused them have not been fixed.\nTexas and New Mexico may been in for an unusually difficult summer.\nMore from ClimateCrisis 247 Home Insurance Costs In Storm-Ravaged Florida Surge $3 Billion 80 Million People Face Destructive Storms Chocolate Prices To Be Hammered Again April Sets Record For The Hottest In History Expand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Disaster declared in Daviess Co. following Wednesday’s storms DAVIESS CO., Ky. (WFIE) - Daviess County leaders signed a disaster declaration after this week’s severe storms. The Daviess County Emergency Management Agency reported major hazards, including power outages along with damage from downed trees and flooding. This all follows after the [National Weather Service confirmed two tornadoes were in the area on Wednesday](https://www.14news.com/2024/05/10/nws-confirms-2-ef-0-tornadoes-daviess-co-wednesday/). Based on estimates from local utilities and transportation crews, the county will likely reach the disaster threshold of $475,235.20 to seek reimbursement.. Officials say the declaration allows for the local Emergency Operations Plan to be fully executed, with DCEMA providing assistance as necessary. Under the State of Emergency, the County Judge/Executive can waive procedures and formalities otherwise required by law pertaining to: - Performance of public work - Entering into contracts - Incurring obligations - Employment of permanent and temporary workers - Utilization of volunteer workers - Rental of equipment - Appropriation and expenditure of public funds Officials say this disaster declaration does not close roads, businesses, or keep anyone from leaving their home. To report storm damage, contact the DCEMA front desk at 270-685-8448. Copyright 2024 WFIE. All rights reserved.",

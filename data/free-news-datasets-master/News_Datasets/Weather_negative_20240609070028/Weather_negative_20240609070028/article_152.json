    "text": "By Alicia de Artola | 7:48 PM EDT\nMay 9, 2024; Chicago, Illinois, USA; A tarp covers the infield before a baseball game between the / Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports\nFans looking forward to watching the Cleveland Guardians take on the Chicago White Sox had to wait on Thursday as the game was delayed by bad weather.\nThe White Sox confirmed the delay a little over half an hour until the scheduled start time. They did not give an indication of when the game would start.\nThat's the thing about rain delays. You're at the mercy of the weather. So we're monitoring updates from Guaranteed Rate Field.\nGuardians-White Sox rain delay updates: Start time set for 7:25 p.m. CT The White Sox had an update for fans at 6:45 p.m. CT. The estimated start time is at 7:25 p.m. CT.\nEstimated first pitch time is 7:25\nâ€” Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) May 9, 2024 The weather could still get in the way of that new start time but for now we know when the teams intend to get going.\nThe Guardians are slated to have Ben Lively on the mound going up against Erick Fedde of the White Sox.\nWhen the two teams met in April, the White Sox picked up one win but the Guardians took the three-game series. They'll play another four games this weekend, assuming weather doesn't complicate matters.\nfeed\nRelated Topics Chicago White Sox Cleveland Guardians MLB News Home / Chicago White Sox",

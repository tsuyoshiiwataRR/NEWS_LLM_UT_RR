    "text": "Hyderabad: The city continues to be drenched under heavy rains, leading to waterlogging in several parts. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for thunderstorms and lightning. Residents can expect a continuous spell of rain as IMD predicts week-long rainfall in the capital of Telangana.\nHyderabad Weather Forecast\nThe weather forecast for the upcoming week indicates a mix of conditions in the region. On May 9 and 10, a partly cloudy sky prevails with the potential for rain, thunderstorms, or dust storms. These atmospheric phenomena can be dynamic and may affect local weather patterns. On May 11, the weather remains consistent with partly cloudy skies and the possibility of rain, thunderstorms, or dust storms. However, the likelihood of these events is subject to local variations and atmospheric conditions. May 12th sees a shift towards clearer skies, with partly cloudy conditions prevailing. Finally, on May 13th, the forecast suggests partly cloudy skies with a heightened potential for moderate rain or thunderstorms.\nTelangana Weather Update\nAfter a bout of heavy rains and thunderstorms on Tuesday, the weather across the state has settled into a comparatively calmer pattern. IMD reported light to moderate rains in isolated areas of Adilabad, Hyderabad, Medchal-Malkajgiri, Rangareddy, and Sangareddy districts. Meanwhile, districts like Jagtial, Kamareddy, Medak, Rajanna Sircilla, Siddipet, and Vikarabad experienced moderate rains and thundershowers. Additionally, hailstorms were observed in isolated places across Adilabad, Medak, Mancherial, Kumurambheem Asifabad, Rajanna Sircilla, and Peddapalli districts.\nTemperatures also took a noticeable dip, with the highest maximum temperature remaining below 44 degrees Celsius. Nizamabad recorded the highest temperature at 42.9 degrees Celsius, while Hyderabad, the capital city, saw a maximum temperature of 40.2 degrees Celsius in Rajendranagar.\nThe IMD reported a weather system affecting the region, with a trough extending from northeast Rajasthan to south interior Karnataka across central Maharashtra and north interior Karnataka at 0.9 km above mean sea level (MSL). This system is expected to bring continued light to moderate rains and thundershowers until May 14.\nA yellow alert has been issued for the state until May 11, followed by an orange alert on May 12, indicating a likelihood of intensified rains accompanied by lightning and gusty winds of around 40-50 kmph in many districts. Over the next 48 hours, the city is expected to experience light to moderate rains or thundershowers, with maximum and minimum temperatures of 38 degrees elsius and 24 degrees Celsius respectively, and relative humidity of 62 pc.",

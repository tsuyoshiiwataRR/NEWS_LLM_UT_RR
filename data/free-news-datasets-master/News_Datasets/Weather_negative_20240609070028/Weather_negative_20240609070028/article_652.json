    "text": "The Sun experienced a particularly powerful X3.9 flare, one of the most powerful in the past 25 years. This is stated on the website of the Solar Astronomy Laboratory of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. \"A new, particularly large flare has been recorded on the Sun. Initial power not less than X3.9. This event is the fourth most powerful in the current 25 solar cycle,\" explained the laboratory, adding that the flare may lead to magnetic storms on Earth on May 12-13. Solar flares are eruptions on the Sun's surface that emit intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation. They occur when the magnetic energy accumulated in the solar atmosphere is released. Solar flares are divided into letter groups by size, the most powerful of which is class X. Then there are M-class flares, which are 10 times less powerful than X-class flares, followed by C-class flares, which are 10 times weaker than M-class flares. Class B flares are 10 times weaker than Class C flares, and Class A flares are 10 times weaker than Class B flares and have no noticeable effect on Earth. Within each class, the numbers 1 to 10 (and higher for Class X flares) describe the relative strength of the flare. Earlier, powerful flares from hyperactive spots on the Sun took place on May 8. month week day",

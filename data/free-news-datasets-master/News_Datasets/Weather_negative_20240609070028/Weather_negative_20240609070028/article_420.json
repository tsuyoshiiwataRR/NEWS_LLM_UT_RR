    "text": "An Atlantic storm is heading for the Uk and could bring 55mph winds, as well as a sudden drop in temperature. New\nweather maps show a huge storm heading over the Atlantic Ocean from Bermuda - bringing the mini-heatwave to an abrupt end.\nWarm, sunny conditions will be felt across the UK this weekend, with forecasters expecting high temperatures of 26C in some parts the country on Saturday. It would make it the hottest day of the year so far, according to the Met Office.\nBut experts are warning of a return to more \"unsettled\" weather next week - and radar data shows a fearsome thunderstorm on its way to the UK. The projections display a weather front carrying intense rainfall forming in the mid-Atlantic towards the end of the weekend.\nThis will then divert across the ocean at the start of next week, with the brunt of the storm making landfall on Tuesday. This will bring rain to most parts of the UK, including around 2-3mm per hour in areas along the western coast, along with up to 55mph wind gusts.\nIn their latest forecast, the Met Offie said: \"Weather conditions are expected to return to a more unsettled pattern as we head into the new working week. Rain and showers will start to move in from the west, due to a developing low pressure system from the Atlantic.\"\nThe Met Office is expecting a change in the weather outlook from Sunday onwards, due to a developing low-pressure system from the Atlantic. Deputy Chief Meteorologist Tony Wisson said: “Many places will start fine and warm on Sunday, though it is likely to become cloudier from the west or southwest during the day. This will be accompanied by scattered showers, which could be heavy with thunder.\n“On Monday we're likely to see more widespread and longer-lived spells of rain, some of which will be heavy and thundery. This will also lead to a much cooler feel to the day.”",

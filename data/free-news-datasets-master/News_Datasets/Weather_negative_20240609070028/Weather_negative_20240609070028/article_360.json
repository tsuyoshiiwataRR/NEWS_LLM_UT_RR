    "text": "Severe storms in Howe blow roofs off, knock down trees, damage city hall Howe, Texas (KXII) - Thursday’s severe storms across Texoma did some serious damage in Howe. Paxton Bryce said that everything was calm, and then the wind came out of nowhere. “I was on the phone with my friend, we were talking and then all of a sudden the wind picked up,” Bryce said. “I was like, ‘okay, it’s a little windy,’ and then it just blew off.” Bryce said he and his sister had just gotten back from school in Arkansas and were getting gas at the Howe Passport on North Collins Freeway when the sheet metal roof flew off and landed on her car, but luckily she wasn’t inside. “It was just kind of like a thrill,” Bryce said. “Something you didn’t expect. You didn’t have really any time to react.” There was also a lot of tree damage in Howe - Smith Road was blocked for a couple of hours as workers and neighbors helped clear fallen trees blocking the roadway. Howe resident Kira Melton said she and her mom were at the dentist in Sherman when they heard about the damage. “She gets a call that the neighbor’s roof had blown off,” Melton said. “We just sped home and then we get here and this is what we see ... and I mean, it just gets worse after this tree.” While a tornado hasn’t been confirmed, News 12′s Chief Meteorologist Steve Lanore says straight line winds at as high as 80 miles per hour blew through this area of Grayson County. Howe City Administrator Monte Walker said that everything was calm, and then all of a sudden it got loud so he went to check it out. “Then I started seeing debris and all kinds of stuff being thrown down the street,” Walker said. “I thought it was a good time to get everybody safe and secure in city hall, so it was scary at first.” Walker said while its now calm again, there’s still work to be done. “It’s going to be a lot of cleanup over the next few days,” Walker said. “We’ve had a lot of help, and this is where Howe really shines because our community members tend to help one another out.” Copyright 2024 KXII.

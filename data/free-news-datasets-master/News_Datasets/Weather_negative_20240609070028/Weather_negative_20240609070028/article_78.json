US weather: Impact of El Nino forecasted by FOX Weather [Federal weather forecasters said La Niña is set to worsen the severity of the 2024 hurricane season, according to a report released on Thursday](/news/weather/137056/la-nina-el-nino-climate-hurricane-season-weather-noaa-report). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [said in the report](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.shtml) that the climate pattern has an 85 percent chance of forming by late fall. NOAA meteorologist Nat Johnson [said to USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/05/09/la-nina-2024-noaa-forecast-hurricane-season/73615549007/): “We are very confident that La Niña will form by this fall.” La Niña is expected to last through next winter and impact US weather for months. More significantly, NOAA forecasters said there’s as much as a 69 percent chance La Niña will develop by July and last through September.

La Niña - a natural climate pattern marked by cooler-than-average seawater in the Pacific Ocean - affects weather and climate patterns in the US and around the world. Its counterpart [El Niño](/latest/el-nino), which generally brings wetter conditions, is fading fast and will soon be replaced by an intermediate stage between El Niño and La Niña called “ENSO-neutral conditions.” According to NOAA’s forecast, meteorologists favor “an imminent transition to ENSO-neutral conditions, with La Niña developing during July-September 2024 and then persisting through the Northern Hemisphere winter.” DON'T MISS: [Terrifying videos emerge of deadly Oklahoma tornado as small town reels](/news/weather/136728/oklahoma-tornado-video-severe-weather-warning) [INSIGHT] [Major manufacturer lays off 62 employees after tornado wipes out Nebraska plant](/news/us-news/136673/garner-industries-lays-off-employees-tornado-lincoln-nebraska) [REPORT] [Severe storm threats mapped as Oklahoma tornado destroys everything in its path](/news/weather/136713/us-storm-threats-mapped-oklahoma-tornado-death) [LATEST] Experts said the transition between El Niño and La Niña seems to be occurring rapidly. Johnson said: “This transition appears to be occurring rather quickly. We are unlikely to experience many seasons of ENSO-neutral conditions before the onset of La Niña, whereas on some other occasions we may experience more than a year before transitioning to La Niña. “The strength of the El Niño is likely a major factor for why this transition is fast. It’s not unusual for strong El Niños to transition quickly to La Niña, as the discharge of heat away from the tropical Pacific tends to be more dramatic following a strong El Niño.” Typically, a La Niña winter in the US brings cold and snow to the Northwest and dry conditions to the southern tier of the country, the NOAA said. The Southeast and Mid-Atlantic tend to see warmer-than-average temperatures during this climate pattern.

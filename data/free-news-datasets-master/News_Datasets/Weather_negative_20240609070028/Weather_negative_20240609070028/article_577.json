    "text": "(CNN) — Relentless rainfall in Brazil has [submerged entire neighborhoods](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/world/brazil-floods-death-toll-intl-latam/index.html) and an airport runway, with more floods likely in the coming days. The severe weather has also downed most communications as crews search for more than 100 missing people. Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Gaza Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said President Joe Biden made a mistake after the US [paused sending a shipment of bombs to Israel](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/inside-bidens-public-ultimatum/index.html) so that they would not be used in an invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israel would fight with its “fingernails” if necessary, Netanyahu said in response. The Israeli military added it has the weapons it needs for its missions in Gaza, including a Rafah invasion. But a halt in US weapons may “significantly impair” Israel’s ability to “achieve military objectives.” Meanwhile, new satellite imagery shows Palestinians have [begun to flee Rafah’s tent cities](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/middleeast/rafah-palestinians-refugees-fleeing-intl-latam/index.html) in large numbers over the past 72 hours as the threat of a potential major Israeli assault looms. 2. Stormy Daniels The testimony of adult film actress Stormy Daniels, a central figure in the criminal case against former President Donald Trump, wrapped on Thursday after Trump’s lawyers [continued their attack on her credibility](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/takeaways-from-day-14-of-the-donald-trump-hush-money-trial/index.html). Daniels pushed back on claims she was untruthful about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, saying that the story was true, even as she was confronted with inconsistencies in some of the small details of her account. Trump has denied the affair. At the end of the day, Judge Juan Merchan [denied two defense motions](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/judge-merchan-calls-out-trump-attorneys-mistrial/index.html), one for a mistrial based on the argument that Daniels’ changed her story about the alleged encounter, and one seeking a modification on a gag order so the former president could talk publicly about Daniels. 3. Health care cyberattack A cyberattack is disrupting clinical operations at a major health care nonprofit, forcing staff to [divert ambulances from “several” hospitals](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/tech/cyberattack-ascension-ambulances-hospitals/index.html). The cyberattack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals in 19 states, is causing issues with electronic health records, some phone systems and “various systems utilized to order certain tests, procedures and medications,” Ascension said Thursday. The incident follows other widespread hacks in recent months that have hobbled health care networks across the US. A February ransomware attack on Change Healthcare caused billing disruptions at pharmacies nationwide and threatened to [put some health providers out of business](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/09/tech/medical-supply-chain-cybersecurity/index.html). Its parent company paid a $22 million ransom to the cybercriminals to protect patient data in that case. 4. Plane safety The Senate on Thursday passed a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill ahead of a key deadline today. The bill would renew authority for the FAA for the next five years and [allocate billions of dollars to improve aviation safety](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/senate-bill-federal-aviation-administration/index.html), enhance protections for passengers and workers and invest in airport and air travel infrastructure nationwide. Among a wide range of provisions, the legislation seeks to address the nation’s shortage of air traffic controllers with directives aimed at expanding hiring and [strengthening consumer protections for refunds](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/29/politics/faa-reauthorization-congress/index.html) for flight cancellations and delays. On the heels of several airline safety mishaps, it would also implement technology to reduce the risk of runway collisions. The House will next need to pass the legislation, which currently has broad bipartisan support. 5. Ukraine Western intelligence believes Russia is seeking to exploit what it sees as a “window of opportunity” to further step up air and ground attacks on Ukraine [as the country awaits further US aid](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/russia-window-of-opportunity-ukraine-war/index.html). This comes as Russia unleashed a massive missile and drone attack on Ukraine this week. Ukrainian authorities say Russia fired more than 50 missiles and 20 drones, targeting its energy infrastructure. Ukraine’s largest power company said this was the fifth time Russia has attacked its facilities in the last six weeks. Meanwhile in Russia, President Vladimir Putin presided over a [choreographed Victory Day parade](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/europe/russia-victory-day-parade-putin-intl/index.html) to display his military might. An estimated 9,000 personnel took part, including a thousand currently serving in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

New ‘Lord of the Rings’ film coming in 2026 The Oscar-winning team behind the nearly $6 billion blockbuster “Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit” trilogies is [reuniting to produce two new films](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/entertainment/new-lord-of-rings-movie/index.html). Justin and Hailey Bieber are expecting their first child together “Baby, baby, baby, oh!” The couple announced [the exciting news](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/entertainment/justin-bieber-hailey-bieber-pregnant/index.html) on Instagram, both [sharing this video](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6wlWteP9s0/?img_index=1) that showcases Hailey Bieber’s belly. Oprah Winfrey: I set an unrealistic standard for dieting Winfrey said on Thursday that she has long played a role in [promoting unhealthy and unrealistic diets](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/media/oprah-winfrey-weightwatchers-diet-culture-ozempic/index.html).

TODAY’S QUOTE “We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.” — Apple, apologizing for its controversial iPad Pro ad. The ad shows objects like musical instruments, paint cans and an ’80s arcade video game crushed by a giant hydraulic press. As the metal slabs of the hydraulic press lift, Apple’s new iPad Pro is revealed. Many internet users [reacted with swift backlash](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/tech/apple-apologizes-for-ipad-pro-ad/index.html), saying the ad celebrated technology’s destruction of human creativity and art.

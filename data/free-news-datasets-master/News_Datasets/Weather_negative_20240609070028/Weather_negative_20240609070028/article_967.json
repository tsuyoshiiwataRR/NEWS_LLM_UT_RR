    "text": "EF-1 tornado touched down in Gilmer County during storms, National Weather Service confirms ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - An EF-1 tornado touched down in Gilmer County during a line of intense storms Wednesday night and Thursday morning, a preliminary report from the National Weather Service (NWS) confirmed. The tornado had maximum winds between 90 and 100 mph, the NWS said. Its path is still being investigated. The NWS sent a survey team to the county on Friday after the strong winds downed power lines, felled trees, and ripped the roofs off of some buildings. “For the community, it’s good to understand exactly what happened. And it helps to educate folks around the area that this kind of thing can happen and how localized it can be,” said David Nadler, who works for the NWS as a warning coordination meteorologist. On Wednesday, the county was under a tornado warning from around 10:45 p.m. until 11:15 p.m. PREVIOUS COVERAGE: [Significant damage left behind by overnight storms in Gilmer County](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2024/05/09/significant-damage-left-behind-by-overnight-storms-gilmer-county/) Near Old Highway 5 and Ellington Road in Ellijay, Atlanta News First crews saw large strips of tin roofing littered on the ground and hanging from at least one power line. Resident William Buckner said his family has owned land off of Old Highway 5 for nearly 80 years — but he’s never seen storm damage like this before. His yard was littered with roofing, two-by-fours, and power lines. Some of the debris came from a nearby storage facility belonging to the Georgia Forestry Commission. “I went back in the house, and I told my wife to get down. We got down, and about 20 minutes later, it was gone,” he said. “I went right in the house in the nick of time, and it just tore everything up.” A [warming center is now open](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0267y7VLqDdiqVaZQ8uLo1BsZVWEH661exNA2zD45UvxGBYmb7QVxSE5utuFVsDnrzl&id=61553884962405&ref=embed_post) at 1561 S Main St. in Ellijay for those who need shelter. The American Red Cross of Georgia said it has helped at least 29 people after severe weather swept through the state this week. That number is expected to rise, the organization added.

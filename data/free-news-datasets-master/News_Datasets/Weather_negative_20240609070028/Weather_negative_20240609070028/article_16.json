    "text": "ANDERSON — A line of storms moving across the Upstate in the early morning hours took down trees, power lines, removed at least one roof in downtown Anderson and closed schools in an Anderson County district. The wave of weather May 9 swept across the Southeast, prompting the National Weather Service to issue several tornado warnings in Tennessee, Alabama, two in South Carolina and two in North Carolina. Clemson University sent out a public safety alert at 1:10 a.m. stating there was a tornado warning, though the NWS didn’t issue one. An all-clear message was sent from the university at 1:46 a.m. — four minutes before the NWS issued a tornado warning for Abbeville, Anderson, Greenville and Laurens counties. The NWS never issued a tornado warning for any part of Pickens County, and the Upstate’s tornado watch expired at 4 a.m. “On Wednesday evening and Thursday morning, Clemson University issued alerts as severe weather moved through the area, including notification of a tornado warning,” university spokesman Joe Galbraith said. “The alert was sent in accordance with the university protocols based upon a tornado warning issued by the SkyGuard warning system, which we use as an additional layer of safety to provide more advanced warnings and additional weather information specific to the unique needs of our campus.” Based on the criteria set with Clemson University, AccuWeather issued a tornado warning for the campus at 1:06 a.m., according to a spokesman. Organizations like Clemson University work with AccuWeather to customize severe weather warnings for their specific locations and needs, AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jon Porter told The Post and Courier. “AccuWeather expert meteorologists believed that the severe thunderstorm had the potential to produce a tornado at any moment,” Porter said in an email. “When minutes matter, advance notice is critical, especially since this episode occurred at night, when tornadoes are more dangerous because many people are asleep.” No tornado had been confirmed in Anderson in the hours since, but National Weather Service meteorologist Scot Krentz said that could change after a May 10 survey. Wind gusts of 60 mph were recorded at the Anderson County Airport, Krentz said, and golf ball-sized hail was reported in Oconee County and east of downtown Greenville. From the radar indications, Anderson and Laurens counties took the hardest hits from the line of storms. CU ALERT: Tornado warning. Seek shelter immediately away from outside walls and windows or in stairwells until you get the ALL CLEAR message.— Clemson University Public Safety (@ClemsonSafety) [May 9, 2024] “We’re still getting lots of reports this morning,” Krentz said. “We had numerous trees down in Spartanburg, power lines and large trees down near Landrum. Laurens County got hit pretty good.” Over 21,000 Duke Energy customers were without power in Anderson County alone, prompting Anderson School District 5 to move to an eLearning day and multiple government offices and convenience centers to close.",

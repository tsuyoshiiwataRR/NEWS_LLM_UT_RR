    "text": "Dolly Parton's theme park in Tennessee - Dollywood - closed on Wednesday (May 8) due to severe weather, amidst tornados and thunderstorm in the state. The theme park and resort's X account released a statement saying that the park was closed Wednesday and reopened on Thursday (May 9). \\\"PARK UPDATE: Due to severe thunderstorms approaching Pigeon Forge this afternoon and through the evening, Dollywood will close today (Wednesday, May 8) at 4 p.m. The park will reopen on Thursday, May 9 at 10 a.m.,\\\" the park said in the post on X. PARK UPDATE: Due to severe thunderstorms approaching Pigeon Forge this afternoon and through the evening, Dollywood will close today (Wednesday, May 8) at 4 p.m. The park will reopen on Thursday, May 9 at 10 a.m.â€” Dollywood Parks & Resorts (@Dollywood) May 8, 2024 ]]>A top vacation destination in the US, Dollywood is ranked six in the Top 25 Amusement Park in the United States list prepared by TripAdvisor. It is ahead of Disneyland, and two other Disney properties. Moreover, official records show that Dollywood is the biggest ticketed tourist destination in Tennessee, hosting nearly 3 million tourists in a typical season.As a result, Dollywood's closure Wednesday meant that many tourists who had pre-booked tickets to visit the park could not do so on May 8. Their frustration were compounded by the fact that Dollywood did not announce any refund for those who could not visit the park due to the unexpected closure. \\\"I canâ€™t believe Dolly Parton would let her Park be unsafe , be closed and not refund money!!!! ðŸ’° ðŸ’°ðŸ’µðŸ’°ðŸ’µðŸ’°ðŸ’µðŸ’°ðŸ’µ,\\\" one user wrote on X. \\\"Wow had such a fun time spending $100 to wait at a park for 5 hours. Called a lady and she wouldnâ€™t even give me a refund for parking. Sky looks good as soon as we leave and Iâ€™m pissed off. I got there at 10 and was there until 4 and didnâ€™t get to ride a single ride,\\\" another posted, along with a photo of the sky. The parkâ€™s website also did not provide any information about potential refunds for tourists who had their visit cut short or couldnâ€™t use their tickets. Under normal circumstances, Dollywood operates until 8:00 p.m. local time, meaning that the tourists lost up to four hours of their scheduled park day due to this early closure.",

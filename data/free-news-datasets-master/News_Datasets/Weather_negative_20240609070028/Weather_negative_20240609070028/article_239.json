    "text": "ST. JOSEPH COUNTY, Mich. (WSBT) — The National Weather Service surveyed the damage and confirms an EF 2 tornado touch downed in St. Joseph County. This part of St. Joseph County, between Centreville and Mendon has widespread damage. A swath of destruction can be seen for quite a distance. “I’ve been involved in law enforcement for 28 years, and I don’t remember a storm that came through that caused the path of destruction like this one in our county,” said Jason Bingaman, St Joseph County Undersheriff. Undersheriff Jason Bingaman recalls what his community experienced Tuesday evening. Severe thunderstorms spawned a tornado, causing extensive damage throughout the county. County officials immediately went into action. “We were doing life-saving measures, making sure that we can account for all the people in to make sure that people were safe,” said Bingaman. According to St Joseph County officials, two minor injuries were reported in Tuesday’s storm. Undersheriff Bingaman is thankful the injuries weren’t any worse. “This particular storm went right through a section of our county where there are several houses that are Amish. We had to make sure we were reaching out to them individually to make sure that they were safe,” said Bingaman. Property damage is the biggest thing left to clean up days after the storm. Farm fields littered with debris, grain bins are squished, irrigation equipment is bent and for some the damage is worse. “There are total losses of houses. For those folks, it’s a matter of being able to find a place for them to stay for now, and then, immediate making sure they have shelter,” said Bingaman. Now that the storm is done, the cleanup continues.",

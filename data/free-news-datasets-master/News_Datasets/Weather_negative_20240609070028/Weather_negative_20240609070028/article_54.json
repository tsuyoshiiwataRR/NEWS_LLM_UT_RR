    "text": "SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH Now In Effect For Portions of the ArkLaMiss: Updated Timeline & Threats with Meteorologist Jake Lambright MONROE, La. (KNOE) - A Severe Thunderstorm Watch is now in effect until 11 p.m. for the counties and parishes shaded in pink in the graphic below. Stay weather aware! Even if your county or parish is not under the watch at this time, it is still important to remain weather aware this evening. My full update is below. The Storm Prediction Center continues to include most of the ArkLaMiss in an ENHANCED RISK (level 3 of 5) for strong to severe storms in their afternoon update. The primary threats for this evening continue to be damaging winds and large hail; however, a tornado or two cannot be entirely ruled out. We will have to keep a close eye on storm activity from 7:00 p.m. Thursday through 1:00 a.m. early Friday morning. As of now, storms are expected to move quickly through our region. Below you can find the latest Futurecast and severe weather outlook. Make sure to share this with friends and family that live in the ArkLaMiss! We have shorter videos published to both Facebook and Instagram, which are linked below. Instagram Update (< 70 seconds): [https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6uqM6dppbH/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6uqM6dppbH/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK: TIMELINE: Isolated showers and storms will begin moving into the ArkLaMiss around 10 p.m. These storms are expected to form a line within a few hours. These storms will continue to move through the region through the 11 p.m. hour. The strongest of these storms will be capable of producing damaging wind gusts in excess of 75 mph and hail up to hen egg size (2.0 inches in diameter). With the moderate to high amount of energy that storms will have to work with, these will likely maintain their strength for at least an hour or two after midnight. Storms finally begin to move out close to 1 a.m. Your Friday morning commute will be clear! Above is a summary of potential storm impacts. Your Weather Authority team will be monitoring the storm threat throughout the day on Thursday. We will provide you with further updates as they become available. Make sure that you are following us on Facebook and have the KNOE Weather app installed on your favorite device! Copyright 2024 KNOE. All rights reserved.",

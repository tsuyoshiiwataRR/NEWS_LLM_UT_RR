    "text": "The Met Office has issued a thunderstorm warning across Somesert, signalling a dramatic end to this week's warm and sunny weather. The severe weather alert is in place from noon to 10pm on Sunday, May 12 and warns of thunder and lightning, heavy rain and the possibility for flooded properties. After weeks of rain and lower-than-usual temperatures, many hoped the current wave of sunshine and warmth would last longer than a week. However, meteorologists say up to 50mm of rain could fall in just two hours on Sunday - but it is still predicted to be 23C. The forecaster says: \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms could lead to some disruption in places, especially to travel. Isolated property flooding is possible.\" According to the Met Office, the storms will begin in the south and move north throughout the day.

Hail, frequent lightning strikes and strong wind gusts will be additional localised hazards.\" The Met Office has forecasted a shift in weather patterns starting this Sunday, as a low-pressure system from the Atlantic makes its approach. Deputy Chief Meteorologist Tony Wisson commented: \"Many places will start fine and warm on Sunday, though it is likely to become cloudier from the west or southwest during the day. This will be accompanied by scattered showers, which could be heavy with thunder.\" \"On Monday we're likely to see more widespread and longer-lived spells of rain, some of which will be heavy and thundery. This will also lead to a much cooler feel to the day.\" In Somerset residents can bask in highs of 24C today (Friday, May 10) and the temperature is set to hit 24C again on Saturday. The mercury may climb to 25C on Sunday, albeit with potential light showers. Come Monday, temperatures are expected to fall to highs of 17C, bringing an overcast day peppered with heavy showers around midday. Tuesday is set to start overcast, transitioning to light showers by late morning.",

    "text": "A potent late-season upper level disturbance will bring an increasing threat of strong to severe thunderstorms statewide through Saturday. The main threat will start over Kauai, Oahu and Maui County late Thursday before expanding eastward to the island of Hawaii during the day Friday.\nBecause of this, a Flood Watch is in effect statewide until 6 p.m. Friday. Also, your First Alert Weather Team has declared First Alert Weather Days for all islands from late Thursday night through Saturday.\nShowers overnight will favor windward and mauka areas, especially along the Koolau mountains on Oahu, where slow-moving showers may become anchored over the terrain and bring the threat of flash flooding.\nOn Friday, the disturbance will bring enough instability over the islands that could trigger isolated severe thunderstorms capable of producing large hail and gusty winds of more than 50 miles per hour, mainly from Oahu through Hawaii Island.\nRainfall is not expected to be widespread, but the scattered hit-or-miss heavy showers could still produce flash flooding which could happen well downstream from mountains. Also, the weather may change suddenly where you are, so there could be sunshine at one moment, and then severe thunderstorms in the next.\nDownload HNN's weather app for everything you need to plan your day. (Hawaii News Now) We also have a First Alert in the surf! A High Surf Advisory has been issued for al south-facing shores through 6 p.m. Friday, with wave heights of 7 to 10 feet expected. Waves will likely remain close to the advisory threshold through Monday or Tuesday, but another round of large surf may be possible again Wednesday into the latter part of next week.\nOn other shores, a small north-northwest pulse will bump up surf for north shores late Friday into the weekend, with a small northwest swell building Sunday night. East shore surf will remain very small through the middle of next week.\n ",

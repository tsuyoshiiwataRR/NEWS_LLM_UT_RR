    "text": "Next 12 Hours The threat of severe weather continues. Auburn and Opelika are now under a severe thunderstorm watch until 11 p.m. Thursday, along with much of the rest of central Alabama. Scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected again this evening. Heavy rain and lightning will occur in spots. A few storms are expected to produce damaging hail, possibly up to golf ball size, and damaging wind gusts up to 70 mph. Though unlikely, an EF0 or EF1 tornado can't be ruled out. Try to avoid unnecessary travel until 11 p.m. Make sure weather radios are turned on and cell phones are fully charged so you can be alerted if a severe thunderstorm warning is issued for your location. If one is issued, a severe thunderstorm is actively occurring and will soon move over you. Seek shelter indoors immediately. Another round of showers and thunderstorms is also expected very late tonight into early Friday morning. Isolated damaging wind, hail, and flooding will again be possible and another severe thunderstorm watch may be needed.

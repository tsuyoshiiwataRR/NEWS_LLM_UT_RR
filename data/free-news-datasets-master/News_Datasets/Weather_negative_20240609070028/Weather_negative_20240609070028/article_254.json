    "text": "The Boston Celtics lost a home playoff game by 24 points. Fans didn't stick around to see more. By Alicia de Artola | 9:52 PM EDT\nMay 9, 2024; Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Cleveland Cavaliers forward Evan Mobley (4) makes the / David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\nMaybe the Boston Celtics got cocky. They beat the Cleveland Cavaliers by 25 points in Game 1 of their second round series. In fact, they'd won their last four playoff games by an average of 23 points.\nOn Thursday, they got humbled on their home floor. Cleveland ran away with Game 2, 118-94. TD Garden was stunned.\nIt was so bad that with five minutes remaining, streams of Celtics fans headed for the exits. Way to stand in and support your team, Bostonians.\nCeltics fans abandoned their team during playoff blowout Celtics fans hitting the exits pic.twitter.com/7IFvqa0dYa\n— Chaz (@ChazNBA) May 10, 2024 Some Cavaliers fans in attendance got their money's worth watching Celtics fans leave early.\nAbsolutely love these bros giving Celtics fans the business pic.twitter.com/0NWwuGXwGc\n— Bottlegate (@Bottlegate) May 10, 2024 The Celtics are the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. They're as heavily favored to win the series as they were to win Game 2 (12.5 points to be exact). But they're not impervious. The players, coaches and fans got a harsh reminder of that on Thursday night.\nTime to check in on Celtics fans and... pic.twitter.com/358SJqA1lE\n— The Athletic NBA (@TheAthleticNBA) May 10, 2024 Celtics fans watching their team down 17 to the Cavs in the 4th quarter pic.twitter.com/XJ8rzpHErS\n— NBA Memes (@NBAMemes) May 10, 2024 Boston has had a contending team for several years now, entering the playoffs as the No. 1 or 2 seed three seasons running. They haven't reached the promised land though. Last year they lost to the Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals. The year before they fell to the Warriors in the NBA Finals.\nCeltics fans may be a bit too quick to turn towards despair but watching your team get trounced at home doesn't produce rational emotions.\nThe series will now move to Cleveland. The Cavaliers haven't lost a game at home in the playoffs yet. They beat the Magic in seven games specifically because they took care of business at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.\nThis was the second time this year Boston has lost Game 2 to a heavy underdog with road games ahead of them. They managed to turn things around against the Heat, winning three in a row. Miami was without their best player though. The Cavs have Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley putting in peak performances.\nGame 3 in Cleveland should be fascinating.\nfeed\nRelated Topics NBA News Boston Celtics Cleveland Cavaliers NBA Playoffs NBA Finals Home / Boston Celtics",

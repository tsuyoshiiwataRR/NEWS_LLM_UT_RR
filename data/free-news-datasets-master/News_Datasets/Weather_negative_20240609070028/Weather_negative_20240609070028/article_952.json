(WCTV) - Severe weather swept through the Big Bend of Florida and South Georgia Friday morning. A squall line containing wind gusts of 60+ mph, small hail, and heavy downpours moved into the western reaches of the Big Bend and South Georgia just before sunrise. Several tornado warnings were issued along the leading edge of the line. As the line approached the eastern reaches of Gadsden County and eventually Leon County in Florida, [a total of potentially three tornadoes were observed](https://www.wctv.tv/2024/05/10/early-reports-indicate-up-3-tornadoes-twisted-friday-gadsden-county-per-leon-county/) on the radar. They were moving from the northwest towards the southeast into Leon County. As depicted below, debris was being lofted very high into the sky, which is indicative of a tornado on the ground. The Tallahassee Airport recorded a thunderstorm wind gust of 65mph. On the campus of Florida A&M in Tallahassee, a destructive wind gust of 84mph was recorded. Crews with the National Weather Service will conduct damage surveys to determine what was damaged by straight-lined winds, and what was damaged by tornadoes. The storms devastated the capital city and surrounding area. Shortly after the worst of the severe weather passed through the area, the Leon County Sheriffâ€™s Office [reported a woman died after a tree crashed onto a home during the storm](https://www.wctv.tv/2024/05/10/lcso-one-dead-after-tree-falls-home/). [Schools across the region canceled classes Friday](https://www.wctv.tv/2024/05/10/fsu-famu-tcc-closed-due-storm-damage/) amid the waves of rain and wind. Government offices across the region also announced [closures ](https://www.wctv.tv/2024/05/10/keiser-universitys-friday-commencement-ceremony-tallahassee-canceled/)and crews across the Big Bend are working to [ restore power to thousands](https://www.wctv.tv/2024/05/10/current-power-outages-across-big-bend-south-georgia/) and [reopen roads. ](https://www.wctv.tv/2024/05/10/list-road-closures-impacting-leon-county-following-fridays-storm/) To stay updated on all the latest forecasts and weather, follow WCTV First Alert Weather on [X](https://twitter.com/WCTVFirstAlert) [ (](https://twitter.com/WCTVFirstAlert) [)](https://twitter.com/WCTVFirstAlert).

    "text": "Water outages to continue to affect several parts of Martinique into at least mid-May. Some business disruptions possible. Ongoing water service disruptions will likely continue in parts of Martinique through at least mid-May due to a lack of rainfall. The Community Water and Sanitation Authority (La Regie Communautaire de l'Eau et de l'Assainissement, ODYSSI) has announced water service outages in several parts of the island, including Fort-de-France, Lamentin, Schoelcher, and Saint-Joseph, through at least May 15. ODYSSI could extend the measures if the dry spell continues. For a full listing of water cut-offs, click here . Some business disruptions are possible, especially for companies that rely on large quantities of municipal water for operations. Confirm alternative water supplies for business operations. Pressure and water quality may be poor after normal service resumes; consider running taps for several minutes before using water. Use only bottled water from reputable suppliers for drinking and hygienic purposes.",

    "text": "By Brett Lackey For Daily Mail Australia\nPublished: 02:14 BST, 10 May 2024 | Updated: 07:03 BST, 10 May 2024\nHeavy rain, thunderstorms and flash flooding could impact large swathes of Australia this weekend with more rain expected after a week of wet weather.\nA high pressure system centred just south of the country is drawing in moisture from the atmosphere which will turn to rain as it meets a pool of upper-level cold air over the next few days.\nNSW and Victoria are in for a soaking, while southern WA, eastern SA and southern Queensland will also see significant falls.\nThe northern half of the country will get some showers but remain mostly dry while Tasmania will see cool and cloudy conditions but avoid significant rainfall.\nThe rain in the eastern half of the country will move from SA towards the coast, hitting Melbourne on Friday and Sydney by late Friday night.\nSouth-east Australia is in for a soaking over the weekend as this cumulative rainfall map for the seven days until Tuesday shows\nSydneysiders should take a umbrella with them if venturing out this weekend and those further south in Illawarra and the South Coast should watch for flood warnings\nAlready saturated catchments in NSW and Victoria could quickly flood, particularly in the Illawarra and South Coast regions of NSW where weekend rainfall totals could exceed 150mm.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology’s Sarah Scully said the upper-level trough will combine with a coastal trough over NSW on Saturday and ‘ramp up’ the rainfall.\n‘Moderate to heavy rainfall is expected in the southern half of NSW,’ Ms Scully said.\n‘We’re expecting to issue a severe weather warning as grounds are really wet through eastern parts of NSW due to recent rainfall.\n‘Inland NSW the rainfall totals look to be more than 50mm over the weekend, some places even reaching 100mm.’\nThe Bureau also has a hazardous surf warning in place for Saturday for the Macquarie coast, Hunter coast, Sydney coast and Illawarra coast.\nCanberra, Brisbane and Cairns will see some showers over the weekend and mild temperatures with Canberra dipping into the single figures overnight.\nDarwin and Adelaide will be in for a fine weekend with tops in Adelaide in the low 20s and Darwin in the low 30s.\nThe rain will ease by Tuesday over most of the country.\nThe second half of next week is forecast to be fine though cool autumn weather.\nThe rain will be focused on the eastern and south-west parts of the country with the central and northern regions escaping most of the rain\nSea surface temperatures remain the warmest on record globally since April 2023 which is affecting the historical modelling for declaring weather events such as El Nino or La Nina.\nThe bureau said sea surface temperatures continue to increase, with temperatures in February, March and April setting records.\nThe Pacific Ocean will likely return to a neutral model (known as an El Nino Southern Oscillation or ENSO) – neither El Nino or La Nina – by June.\nThere are also predictions a La Nina will return by late winter but forecasts will not be firm enough to declare until after May.\n‘El Nino and La Nina predictions made in early autumn tend to have lower accuracy than predictions made at other times of the year,’ the bureau said.\n‘As the current global ocean conditions have not been observed before, inferences of how ENSO may develop in 2024 that are based on past events may not be reliable.’\nLa Nina conditions typically lend to higher rainfall totals and cooler average day time temperatures.\nWEEKEND WEATHER IN YOUR CITY SYDNEY\nFriday Rain increasing.

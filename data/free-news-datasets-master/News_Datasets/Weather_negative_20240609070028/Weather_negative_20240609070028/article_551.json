    "text": "The sunny weather much of the UK has been enjoying is due to come to an abrupt end as the Met Office issues a thunderstorm warning across parts of the country. The severe weather alert lasting from midday until 10pm on Sunday, May 12, predicts lighting storms, heavy rainfall, and potential flooding across parts of the UK. Plymouth is just outside of the warning zone, with the yellow weather warning covering much of the South Hams , narrowly missing Ivybridge . Read more: The weather forecasters, based in Exeter, are predicting that up to 50mm of rain could fall in just two hours this Sunday, despite temperatures remaining around a pleasantly warm 23C, reports BristolLive . A spokesperson for the Met Office warns: \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms could lead to some disruption in places, especially to travel. Isolated property flooding is possible. \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms are likely to break out in the south of this area late Sunday morning and early Sunday afternoon, moving steadily north while growing into larger areas of rain before clearing the area. \"Some intense downpours are possible in a few places, giving up to 30 mm in less than hour and perhaps 40-50 mm over two to three hours leading to surface water flooding. Hail, frequent lightning strikes and strong wind gusts will be additional localised hazards.\" The warning encompasses vast areas of the west, including Bristol, Somerset, Devon and Gloucestershire, as well as most of Wales. Despite the impending heavy rain and storms, temperatures are predicted to stay high. Plymouth is set to see temperatures of 20c on Friday, 21C on Saturday and 18C on Sunday. Heavy downpours are predicted for Monday, with temperatures of 14C.",

    "text": "MAURY COUNTY, Tenn. (WZTV) — In Maury County, where several [people were injured and one person died](https://fox17.com/news/local/radar-confirmed-tornado-hits-maury-county-wednesday-middle-tennessee-columbia-spring-hill-national-weather-service-severe-weather#), Columbia residents describe what they saw as a tornado ripped through their neighborhood. On Thursday, FOX 17 News went into some of the hardest hit communities seeing just some of the devastation, that families now have to grapple with. Some of the damage was seen on Cardinal Trail. It's the roadway where Shannon McCue rushed to in an attempt to get home to her husband, Adam Lazenby. ALSO READ | ['Come together, have patience and rebuild': Maury County community unites amid devastation](https://fox17.com/newsletter-daily/come-together-have-patience-and-rebuild-maury-county-community-unites-amid-deadly-tornado-devastation-severe-weather-columbia-spring-hill-tennessee) But the storm hit sooner than she expected, with two fallen trees trapping her car in. This, while Lazenby says he road out the tornado on their property. I was sitting in the driveway waiting for her to get home and then the back shop door blew into the hood of my truck and I ran and just jumped in the back seat as the tornado just took the whole shop around me,\" detailed Lazenby. \"You did see it, you said it sounded like a freight train,\" said McCue. \"It's cliché, but it really is that loud like a train. It took most the building with it. His truck and the debris is still there. The truck saved him.\" Celebrating their 10-year anniversary this year, this couple now feels closer than ever. And although they're now looking at upwards of $100,000 in damage, they are just thankful their home is still standing. As of Thursday, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency says in Maury County 105 homes were damaged and 40 were destroyed. TEMA says they're working with the community to do a more formal damage assessment Friday morning at first light, and they'll be evaluating that damage to see what kind of potential aid these families may qualify for.

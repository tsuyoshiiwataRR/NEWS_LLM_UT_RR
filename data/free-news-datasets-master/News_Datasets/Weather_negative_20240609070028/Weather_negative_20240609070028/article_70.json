    "text": "NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCIV) â€” An individual getting off a school bus in early March was pistol-whipped multiple times in an attempted armed robbery in North Charleston, the city police department said in an incident report. On March 8, North Charleston Police Department officers were sent to the site of an assault on Centre Pointe Drive. When police arrived, they encountered a victim who said that as they exited a school bus at Constitution Avenue around 3:45 p.m. two suspects chased them down, asked for money and beat them with the butt of a black Glock that had an extended magazine, the incident report said. The altercation began when the victim began walking home after getting off at the bus stop. One of the suspects got off the bus at the same stop and got into a dark blue Chevy Malibu that was waiting near the vicinity, police said.

Both suspects then exited the vehicle, chasing down the victim on Ranger Drive where they began repeatedly asking where the money was located, police said. When the victim said they didn't have any money, that was when the suspects struck them with a handgun on the left side of the head, police said. The victim then dropped the book bag and ran into a nearby residence while the suspects rummaged through the bag before running back to the car, police said. One arrest has been made in the case, which was carried out on March 22.",

    "text": "Zetech Sparks head coach Maurice Obilo has blamed inadequate training as one of the major challenges affecting the team currently in the Kenya National Women’s Basketball League.\nThe students lost 86-68 to defending champions and league leaders Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) last weekend, a defeat Obilo is linking to poor training due to the ongoing heavy rains in the country.\nZetech are currently second on the log with 38 points after 20 matches with two games to go in the regular league, six points behind league leaders KPA, who are done with the regular league season waiting for the season-end playoffs.\n“The girls did well, we played at our level best, because we did what we could and everything that we wanted to do worked for us. Lack of practicing is what hurt us in that game as we are training in the outdoors and the rains could not allow us to train well for the past one month but we came out and did what we could and played to our level best,” Obilo said.\nObilo has however backed his charges to bounce back.\n“I am proud of the girls, I am proud of the effort they are putting in, they are just amazing girls. With time, if the rains allow us, we will go back to our routine of training and we will definitely give better performance in the next games.”\nElsewhere, UON Dynamites head coach Eugene Kalman has taken issue with their opponent for not showing up on Saturday and giving them a walkover in another women’s premier league match.\nDynamites, who were away in Nakuru to face home side The Swish, were left unhappy when the home team failed to honour the fixture.\nKalman said it was a waste of time and resources for them and such behaviour should not happen again as it lowers the morale of players and credibility of the league.\n“It’s a shame, we used resources to prepare, travel then they didn’t show up. It’s very unprofessional. Apparently the team only has players from Nairobi, which is unfortunate as it’s a Nakuru based team.\n“Such a team needs to use local-based players and not depend on players from Nairobi because if locals can’t get this opportunity to represent Nakuru, when will they ever get a chance. We need to develop players,” Kalman said.\nThe Dynamites are eighth on the log with 26 points from 18 matches. They have won seven and lost 12 so far with four games to go.\nTags: Zetech Sparks Want to send us a story?

    "text": "Fishing Roundup: Blast of heat will pass and quality angling should continue Ken Willis Daytona Beach News-Journal Show\nDaytona Motor Mouths: Jockeying for position Photo finishes in Kansas and the Kentucky Derby, a NASCAR runner-up more heartbreaking than Buescher and early Darlington thoughts. What was THAT?\nHere we were tip-toeing our way through May , acclimating to the weekly upward nudges on Mother Nature's thermostat, and out of nowhere, she delivers a mid-August punch just to let us know who's boss.\nMid-90s? In early May? There should be a law!\nYou have to wonder what our newer Floridians think on days like this. Back home it's probably barely touching 70, and now they're dealing with the doubleheader threat of heat stroke and sunburn. Rethinking that Poughkeepsie exodus, Earl?\nRIG UP Pompano season means pompano rigs, which aren't just for pompano. True story\nNot to worry (much), we're supposed to normalize over the weekend with high temps remaining around low-80s sanity levels. But we're getting to the time of year when you really gotta love fishing to battle our unique elements — the good news: those afternoon thunderstorms will cool things down a bit.\nBut you'll still get out there, of course. As the underrated Mark Chestnutt crooned some 30 years ago: \"It's too hot to fish, too hot for golf, and too cold at home.\"\nMeanwhile, before the roundup, let's stay in the Way Back Machine and ask Johnny Carson just how hot it was today ...\n\"It was so hot, I saw a cop chasing a robber and they were BOTH walking.\"\n\"So hot, I saw a fire hydrant flag down a dog.\"\n🎶 Well it sure feels good to come in here,\nAnd just pull up a seat.\nA frosty mug of a cool one,\nHelps to beat the heat.\nThese old dog days of summer,\nLord, I'll be glad when they're gone.\nIt's too hot to fish, and too hot for golf,\nAnd too cold at home.🎶\n—Mark Chestnutt, Too…\n— Texas Darlin' 🎀 🏈 (@TexitDarling) April 14, 2024 Halifax/Indian River Unless the drive-by heat wave chased them away, you might still find a pompano dipping its toes into the river. It’s also time for jacks to start turning up their aggression, as if they weren’t already quite maniacal.\nAll of the above means it’s time to make sure you’re familiar with the differences between the prized pompano and its less tasty, low-foreheaded cousin. The physical similarities include a propensity for avoiding boats, docks and shorelines, and they’ll both fight like hell to make that known.\nBest description I’ve seen in differentiating these two fish involves their eyes. The jack looks like he just left a snorting session with a hair band, while the pomp’s carefree gaze suggest he just stepped away from Willie Nelson’s tour bus.\nMeanwhile, “the river has been producing some big jacks, up to 10 pounds, and that’s been fun,” says Capt. Jeff Patterson ( Pole Dancer charter ).\n“The docks have been good for reds, snook and seatrout,” he adds. “The inlet has been slow for me. We saw some tarpon but couldn’t get them to play. I’ve caught some blues but that’s about it.”\nEarly birds are finding nice-sized trout in Southeast Volusia (SeVo?), in the backwaters throughout Edgewater and Oak Hill.\nTo the north, Ike Leary is seeing mangrove snapper and black drum come to the planks at the Granada pier near the bridge.\nFarther north, up around Highbridge, Jeff Muller ( Yellow Dawg bait shop) says they’ve been seeing some quality fish brought up on the river, with pompano and whiting highlighting the beachside catches.\nSharks have been spending more time than usual in the river, he adds, with the blacktip count reaching eight at one point.\nSurf “Pockets of pompano” is the highlight on the northernmost beaches in our area, where the water quality has been dicy.\n“Try north of an inlet to find some cleaner water and use a Carolina rig with a piece of shrimp in a trough for the black drum,” says Cathy Sanders ( Fishin’ Girl surf charter ). “Fresh dead shrimp and Fishgum have been the ticket for catching fish lately for me, and our red or green float rigs have been catching fish in spite of the conditions.”\nLive sandfleas and the sandflea-flavored Fishbites have been useful for Chris Mansfield ( Reel Healin’ Outdoors ), he says. A trip to Bethune Beach this week produced too many catfish, but he mixed in a 14-inch pompano.\nDid someone say pompano?\nClean water and good conditions, save for afternoon winds, in the Shores and Wilbur area, according to Marco Pompano , who sent along a picture of a monster pomp that nearly tipped out at 20 inches.\n“We grilled it up with some teriyaki. You would’ve loved it,” he says. Gee, thanks.\nYou’d think the ever-warming weather, even before this late-week death-ray, would’ve signaled the end of the northward pompano migration, but Marco has a gut feeling that says otherwise.\n“I truly believe the main load hasn’t arrived yet. Some people think it’s past us but I’m much more positive than that.”\nSt. Johns The panfish bite is still strong in numbers and a little variety — the specks are thick and the bluegill are apparently begging for attention.\n“They’re here and they’re on fire,” says Capt. Bryn Adams ( Highland Park Fish Camp ). “Live crickets and worms and even beetle spins work great. We’re targeting shoreline cover and tree tops along the Norris Dead River.”\nFor the specks, find deeper water.\n“Under docks and overhanging trees,” suggests Don McCormick, who reported a few tremendous outings this week, including a successful search for sunshine (aka hybrid) bass.\n“That bite is really good, also,” he says. “There’s plenty of bait in the river just about anywhere you go.”\nEducate yourself Capt. Jamie Thrappas operates a local fishing charter and owns a bait shop next to Highbridge, both of which wear the Yellow Dawg nameplate.\nHe’ll share much of what he’s learned from his 18 years of local fishing at this month’s meeting and seminar at the Halifax Sport Fishing Club, next Thursday (May 16). Capt. Jamie’s presentation will start about 7:30 p.m., after some club business.\nMore info on the website.\nHook, line and clicker: Send us your fish pics We want to see your most recent catch. Email your fish photos to ken.willis@news-jrnl.com.\nPlease include first and last name of angler(s), as well as type of fish (we're occasionally stumped). All are included with our online fishing report, and some occasionally make the print edition.\nDo I need a fishing license? You can find all the license info, including exemptions, on Florida's Fish and Wildlife Commission website: MyFWC.com. But the basics are: No: If you're 65 or older, 15 or younger, you don't need a license. “ Probably” Not: If you're fishing with a licensed guide or charter boat, both of which often purchase commercial licenses that cover their customers. Yes: Most everyone else, including visitors from other states. Yes: Even if you're a shore-based angler (shoreline, dock, pier, bridge, etc.), and even if fishing with a shore-based guide. However: The shore-based license is free . . . But: You still need to register for that free license.\nWhere do I get a license and what does it cost? Many bait shops sell licenses, as do the bigger retailers (Bass, Dick's, Walmart, etc.). Florida's FWC uses a third-party site for buying or renewing fishing licenses: GoOutdoorsFlorida.com. The cost : $17 for an annual license. Don't forget: Whether you're fishing fresh or saltwater, you need the specific license. Freshwater and saltwater licenses are both $17 annually.\nI’m here on vacation, do I need a license? Yes you do, and they're also available at GoOutdoorsFlorida.com or certain bait shops and big retailers. Cost: $17 for three days, $30 for seven days, $47 for a year. Also: Non-residents need to purchase that license even if they're just fishing from shoreline or shore-based structures. (Florida residents need that license, too, but they're free.)\n ",

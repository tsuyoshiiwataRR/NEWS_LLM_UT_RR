    "text": "STORY: ::Mexicans feel 'desperate, dizzy and weak' as the country grapples with heat wave hitting 95°F :: Location: Mexico City, Mexico :: Location: Oaxaca City, Mexico :: Date: May 9, 2024 :: Maria De Jesus, Tamale Seller \"It hurts your head, you feel desperate, dizzy, and weak, obviously because of the heat stroke.\" :: Roberto Aguilar, Analyst \"We have gone from a season of drought that has dried up and drained the dams, and there is not enough water for power generation. We have also moved quickly to extreme heat, further stressing the situation. Today, we also see the fires that have manifested this. What we've been seeing historically is high, and I think the rapid deterioration of the environment is a manifestation of that.\" In Mexico City, residents sought relief from the sweltering conditions by bathing in fountains, using fans, and shielding themselves from the sun's relentless rays with umbrellas. A maximum temperature of 33 degrees Celsius (91.4°F) was recorded in the country's capital on Thursday. Meanwhile, the colonial and tourist city of Oaxaca, southern Mexico, has been experiencing high temperatures since the weekend, which have kept the thermometers above 35 degrees Celsius (95°F) with thermal sensations of 40 degrees Celsius (104°F). The scorching sun and a dry environment have forced locals and visitors to wear umbrellas and hats. Mexico is experiencing its second heat wave of the spring season, with temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius (86°F) across the country. Electricity demand and unseasonably hot weather have caused power outages in at least 15 states, and drought has affected dam levels.",

    "text": "KILLEEN, Texas â€” 27-year-old Nathaniel Dejuan Daniel Brown has been indicted for intoxication manslaughter and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for his involvement in a [car crash that occurred back on Oct. 9, 2022](/article/news/local/woman-dies-in-fatal-wreck-in-killeen/500-d0ba9b60-9720-4f8c-b547-59bf88783e71), an arrest affidavit reveals. According to the affidavit, on that day, police arrived to the 5200 block of South State Highway 195 to the report of a car crash. Upon arrival, police found Brown to be the only person in his car, which had sustained significant damage along the driver side, according to the affidavit. The affidavit states that a witness saw Brown halfway in the front and the back of the car as he was attempting to crawl into the back seat. Officer Jones with Killeen PD was the first one to make contact with Brown, who was mostly in the backseat by that point, and noted that Brown appeared to be sleepy with bloodshot eyes, according to the affidavit. The affidavit states that Jones also noticed a strong smell of alcohol coming from Brown's car. The victim, 26-year-old Destiny Lopez, suffered severe injuries and was reportedly entrapped in her car. Once she was removed, Lopez was taken by helicopter to Baylor Scott & White where she later died, according to the affidavit. After Brown was taken to hospital, police executed a search warrant for his blood sample. It was analyzed at the DPS lab in Houston and it showed Brown had a blood alcohol concentration of .15, according to the affidavit. The affidavit states that a nearby business had captured the crash on a surveillance camera. The video showed Brown traveling southbound in the northbound lane of SH 195, heading into oncoming traffic. The Event Data Recorder on Brown's car showed that he was driving 88 miles per hour when he crashed into Lopez, the affidavit revealed. Due to all of this information, police were able to determine that Brown was at fault based on his intoxication, excessive speed and his driving in the opposite direction of traffic.

    "text": "Reports from Dien Bien Dong District Police Department said that the flood occurred at 1 am on May 10 in Suoi Lu Village of Phi Nhu Commune. \"Right after hearing about the incident, we sent a rescue team with over 50 members to the area to help local people deal with the problem,\" the police said. \"A house collapsed and all belongings washed away in the strong flood which also damaged four motorbikes and submerged some 30 other houses in thick mud and large stones.\" Some people living in vulnerable areas have been evacuated while local authorities and villagers cleared the mud. The flash flood also caused serious landslides on the National Road 279D and many houses along the road in the neighbouring province of Son La's Muong La District, which blocked traffic for over an hour. Local authorities arrived to clear the road and traffic resumed at 6.30 am the same day. According to the National Centre for Hydro-meteorological Forecasting, heavy rains spread in the mountainous northwestern localities from Thursday night to Friday morning, with average rainfall of over 50 mm.",

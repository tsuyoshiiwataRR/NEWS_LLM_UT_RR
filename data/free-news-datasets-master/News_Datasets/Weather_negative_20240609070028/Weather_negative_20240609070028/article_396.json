    "text": "Severe weather forecast across parts of Hawaii, US, through at least May 13. Flooding and associated disruptions possible. Thunderstorms are forecast across parts of Hawaii through at least May 13. Heavy snow of up to 15 cm (6 inches) and strong winds gusting over 113 kph (70 mph) are forecast across higher elevations. As of late May 9, the National Weather Service (NWS) has issued flash flood warnings for the island of Maui in Maui County through 19:30 May 9, as well as winter storm and high wind warnings across the Big Island Summits through early May 11. Flood watches are in place for all the main Hawaiian islands through late May 10. High surf advisories are in effect for the south-facing shores of all Hawaiian Islands through late May 10. Authorities will likely issue new alerts or update/rescind existing advisories as weather conditions change over the coming days. Sustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed or a lack of stormwater drainage systems. Sites downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where heavy rain has saturated the soil. Disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible where significant flooding, strong winds, or landslides impact utility networks. Floodwaters and debris flows may render some bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Severe weather could also trigger flight delays and cancellations at airports in the affected regions. Localized business disruptions may occur in low-lying areas; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of flood damage to facilities and some employees' inability to reach work sites. Monitor local media for weather-related updates and advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business arrangements before traveling in Hawaii. Seek updated information on road conditions before driving or routing shipments through areas where severe weather is forecast; plan for possible supply chain disruptions throughout the affected areas. Stay away from elevated streams, creeks, and other watercourses that are prone to flash flooding. Do not attempt to navigate flooded roadways. Exercise caution in elevated terrain due to the threat of landslides. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

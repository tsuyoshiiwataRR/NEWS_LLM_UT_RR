    "text": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala. ( WAFF ) - Sherrie and Michael Belmont have been trying to process their last 24 hours the best they can.\nThe National Weather Service confirmed an EF-1 tornado tore through their community, uprooting large trees and damaging several homes and the historic Maple Hill Cemetery.\n“When we got out, we’re both kind of shellshocked. I mean... It is bad,” Sherrie said.\nThey’ve been in their home on Eustis Avenue since 1998 and avoided any real damage, but one look around told them everything they needed to know about how dangerous the situation was.\n“We were in the hallway just about to go downstairs when it really hit,” she said. “We were so shocked, we just stopped. It went through so fast and you could hear it. It was quiet and then we heard an explosion, which ended up being the pecan trees and the big trees around us that came down and hit our poor neighbor’s house.”\nSherrie walked me through her neighborhood showing every close call they were lucky enough to avoid. She applauded the city and her neighbors for the swift action taken to clean up the leftover debris.\nIt means more to her because she knows the rich history associated with her community.\n“[Our street] used to be Maiden Lane instead of Eustis. There used to be Huntsville College across the street. We have a picture in our house of their homecoming and the parade and it’s right in front of our house,” she said.\nIt’ll take time, but the Belmonts know their neighborhood will bounce back. While the road to recovery will take a while for the communities across here and Five Points, but the miraculous thing about it: to this point, there have been no deaths associated with any of these storms.\nClick Here to Subscribe on YouTube: Watch the latest WAFF 48 news, sports & weather videos on our YouTube channel!\nCopyright 2024 WAFF.

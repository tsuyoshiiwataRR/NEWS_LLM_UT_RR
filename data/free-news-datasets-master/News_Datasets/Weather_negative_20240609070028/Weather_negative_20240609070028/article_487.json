    "text": "The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) has issued a ‘Condition Orange’ forest fire warning for the coming days.\nDue to the current weather patterns, the department said that a high fire-risk is deemed to exist in all areas where “hazardous fuels” such as dead grasses and shrub fuels like gorse and heather are present.\nThe warning is currently set to remain in place until 12:00p.m on Monday, May 13 .\nThe department said that that the “high-pressure dominated” weather will bring settled conditions and higher temperatures across the country.\nWhile some areas may receive isolated rain showers during this time, most areas can be expected to see dry weather, light to moderate winds, higher temperatures and strongly elevated fire risks in areas with fire-prone vegetation types.\nFire warning In the event that fires do occur, DAFM said that fire behaviour is likely to be moderated by increased live fuels growth, particularly in upland grasses.\nHowever, it said that fires may be adversely influenced by light and variable winds.\nForest owners, farmers, rural dwellers and other countryside users are asked to be extremely vigilant regarding fire activity, to report any suspicious or illegal activity to the Gardaí and to report all fires immediately to the Fire and Emergency Services via 112/999.\nDue to current weather patterns a high fire risk is deemed to exist in all areas where hazardous fuels such as dead grasses, heather and gorse exist.\n⚠️Warning Effective From 1200hrs 09/05/2024\n⚠️Effective Period Expires 1200hrs 13/05/2024\n▶️ https://t.co/czsOK2nljP pic.twitter.com/OcC35t3bGI\n— Dept of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (@agriculture_ie) May 9, 2024 All forest owners and managers are being advised to prepare for likely outbreaks of fire.\nThe department said that fire lines, fire plans, fire suppression equipment should be reviewed and made ready.\nOwners and managers of forestry should also check that insurance and helicopter contracts are checked and confirmed.\nThey should also consider the fire mitigation measures that they can put in place to help prevent loss or damage to forest resources through fire\nThe department said that it is an offence to cut, grub, burn or otherwise destroy any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated between March 1 and August 31, in any year.\nIt added that landowners found burning illegally could face fines, imprisonment and single farm payment penalties.\nThe department reminded members of the public who are planning on visiting forests not to use barbeques or open fires at any stage.\nVisitors to the countryside should be considerate in parking vehicles so as not to impede access by emergency vehicles.\nRelated Stories: DAFM to contact farmers after mountain fires in Carlow Met Éireann: Warm weekend ahead but rain set to return",

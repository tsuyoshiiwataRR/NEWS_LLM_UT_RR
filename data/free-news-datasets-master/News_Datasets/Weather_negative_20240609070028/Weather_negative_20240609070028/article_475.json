Yesterday evening, Thursday, May 9, a scuba diver lost consciousness in the water in Plymouth Sound and sparked the large-scale emergency response.\nTwo helicopters were seen circling the waterfront at around 9pm after the diver fell ill in the sea in Millbay. The response, which was led by HM Coastguard, involved both a Coastguard helicopter and a Devon Air Ambulance, alongside the Plymouth RNLI team.\nThe stricken diver was rescued from the water and brought to shore by the RNLI&apos;s all-weather lifeboat. The casualty was then handed over to paramedics.\nREAD MORE Live: Ten Tors &apos;disruption&apos; as police close road to probe &apos;incident&apos;\nREAD MORE UK weather: Bermuda storm to hit Britain in days as weather maps turn blue\nAccording to local eyewitnesses, the incident took place in the water in Millbay. A Devon Air Ambulance from Exeter was called to the incident at 8.32pm, along with Devon and Cornwall Police and South Western Ambulance Service, reports PlymouthLive .\nA spokesperson for Devon Air Ambulance said: \"I can confirm that our Exeter helicopter crew were tasked to Plymouth at 20:32 on Thursday 9 May to attend an adult male who was reported to be unconscious following a scuba dive. The patient was accompanied by our crew to Derriford Hospital by land ambulance for further treatment.\"\nThe incident garnered a lot of interest from locals, one of whom said they saw \"loads of boats searching\" the water. Another told PlymouthLive: \"The helicopter was following a speedboat to begin with. It was so low that the water was splashing from the backdraft. It raised then where it&apos;s pictured and hovered still for a few mins.\"\nA spokesperson for HM Coastguard said: \"An unwell diver was recovered and brought to shore by the Plymouth RNLI all weather lifeboat yesterday evening before being handed over to ambulance paramedics.\n\"A Coastguard helicopter, Helimed, the Plymouth all weather and inshore RNLI lifeboats, a warship, police and ambulance were all involved in the incident which was coordinated by HM Coastguard.\"\nWant the latest Devon breaking news and top stories first?

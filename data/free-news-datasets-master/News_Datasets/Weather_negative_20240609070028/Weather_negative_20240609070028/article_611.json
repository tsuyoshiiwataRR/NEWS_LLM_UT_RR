Pic: Met Office It comes as the UK experiences high temperatures today and over the weekend – before forecasters warn of “thundery breakdowns” on Sunday. People surfing during spring sunshine, as the warm weather is set to continue into the weekend, at Fistral Beach, Newquay, Pic: Reuters The warning is in place from noon to 10pm on Sunday and covers northwest England, most of Wales, much of central England and the South West. See the latest weather forecast where you are “Heavy showers and thunderstorms could lead to some disruption in places, especially to travel,” the Met Office says. “Isolated property flooding is possible.” It adds: “There is a small chance that homes and businesses could be flooded quickly, with damage to some buildings from floodwater, lightning strikes, hail or strong winds.” The south of England will see highs of 25C (77F) today, with the potential of temperatures reaching 26C (78.8F) on Saturday and possibly 27C (80.6F) on Sunday, according to the Met Office. Despite the sunshine, storms are on the horizon for many – beach walkers pictured earlier this year. Pic: PA Scotland and Northern Ireland are also expected to enjoy warmer springtime weather, with 22C (71.6F) forecast for Saturday in Glasgow. The spell of warm weather is down to a block of high pressure that has been over the UK for much of this week. With it, the country has also seen increased levels of UV and pollen and even two wildfire warnings. Fire services for Dorset and Wiltshire as well as Hampshire and the Isle of Wight issued the warnings for this weekend. However, much of the sunshine and blue skies will give way to rain and thunderstorms during Sunday. Deputy chief meteorologist Tony Wisson previously said: “Many places will start fine and warm on Sunday, though it is likely to become cloudier from the west or South West during the day. This will be accompanied by scattered showers, which could be heavy with thunder. “On Monday we’re likely to see more widespread and longer-lived spells of rain, some of which will be heavy and thundery. This will also lead to a much cooler feel to the day.” Sky News weather producer Joanna Robinson said that along with the wind and rain, next week temperatures will drop back closer to the average for this time of year.News Related - Russian forces encircle Ukraine’s Avdiivka and ‘ready to storm city’ after months-long offensive Ukrainian serviceman stands next to residential buildings heavily damaged by permanent Russian military strikes in the front line town of Avdiivka Russian troops have encircled the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka from “all directions” following a months-long offensive that is yet to see a significant breakthrough on the battlefield.

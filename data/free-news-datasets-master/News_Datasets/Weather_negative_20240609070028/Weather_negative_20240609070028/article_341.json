    "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. (KATU) — Sunny temperatures in the upper 80s in May have many jumping for joy, but with the higher temperatures comes increased health risks. In 2023, there were six heat-related deaths in Multnomah County. In 2022, there were five. And few of us can't forget the summer of 2021, when 72 people died from health issues caused by extreme heat. “The signs of dehydration start to occur when you’re already dehydrated, so the best rule of thumb is to stay hydrated in advance,” said Dr. Richard Bruno, health officer at the Multnomah County Health Department. Bruno says in addition to drinking plenty of water, make sure you're taking breaks in the shade and take a cool shower if you need to. It's also important to know the signs of heat exhaustion, which can include excessive sweating, rapid heartbeat, muscle aches and nausea. “The older brother to that is heat stroke,” Bruno said. “People can start to get confused, have loss of consciousness or seizures. These are very concerning, and people need to get right to the emergency room if that happens.” Volunteers at search and rescue are preparing for an influx of hikers to hit the trails this weekend. They say with the high temperatures, it's even more important to make a plan and be prepared. “Water and clothing are the top two most important things,” said search and rescue volunteer Mika Steyskal. She says this means wearing lightweight clothing, proper footwear and bringing extra clothing. She also says a lot of people underestimate the amount of water they'll need to drink, especially in the heat, so bring extra. “They’ll go through all this water, they get really hot, they sweat it all out, and by the time they reach the top of their point, they run out of water,” she said. While streams and waterfalls may look like a refreshing way to cool down, the health department urges caution. Bruno says bodies of water like the Sandy River and the Willamette River are only about 40 degrees. “They can be especially dangerous in late spring when mountain snow melts keep them cold and fast moving, even as the air temperatures are rising,” said Bruno. Bruno advises limiting your time spent in the water and taking safety precautions in bodies of water with currents. “Make sure people are wearing life jackets in any body of water that may have currents going,” he said. “Unfortunately, we lose people every year to drowning and these dangerous waters.” It’s advice search and rescue volunteers echoed. “When you get into cold water, it’s going to be really shocking on your body,” said SAR volunteer Sam Skolnik. “Plan for that. Make sure that if you’re going to be getting in a body of water that people are around you that can call 911 or make a plan to get you out if they need to.” If you need another way to cool off in the woods, they recommend this trick. “An easy way you can stay wet without going in those freezing cold temperature waters is getting a bandana, getting it wet, and putting it on yourself,” said Steyskal. Search and rescue also urge hikers to plan their routes, share the route with others, and tell them when you are planning to be back, so they can call for help if necessary. Bruno says the health department is going to meet Friday to evaluate whether to open cooling shelters this weekend. One of the thresholds is the first 90-degree day of the year, which we could see.",

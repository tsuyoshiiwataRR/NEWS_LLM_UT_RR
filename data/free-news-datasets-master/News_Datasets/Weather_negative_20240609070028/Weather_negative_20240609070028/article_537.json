    "text": "Severe weather forecast across much of India through at least May 14. Transport, business, and utility disruptions possible. Severe weather is forecast across much of India through at least May 14. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a press release May 10 warning of a wet spell accompanied by thunderstorms, lightning, and strong winds across central, eastern, and southern peninsular India through May 13. Several active weather systems over central, northern, northeastern, and southern regions are expected to bring widespread light-to-moderate rainfall accompanied by storms across much of the country over the coming days, with isolated heavy rainfall in places. Heavy downpours may lead to flooding in low-lying areas and landslides on unstable slopes. The IMD has issued the following severe weather warnings across the country May 10-14: May 10 Orange thunderstorm and lightning warnings (the middle level on a three-tier scale): Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and Gangetic West Bengal. Orange hailstorm warnings: Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Orange strong wind warnings: Eastern Madhya Pradesh. Orange dust storm warnings: Rajasthan. Yellow heavy rain warnings: Assam, southern interior Karnataka, Kerala, Meghalaya, Odisha, Puducherry, and Tamil Nadu. Yellow thunderstorm and lightning warnings: Across the rest of the country not under orange thunderstorm warnings, with the exception of western coastal areas. Yellow hailstorm warnings: Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Yellow dust storm warnings: Chandigarh, Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. Yellow hot and humid warnings: Western Gujarat and Kerala. May 11 Orange thunderstorm and lightning warnings: Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, central Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and Gangetic West Bengal. Orange hailstorm warnings: Madhya Pradesh, central Maharashtra, and Uttarakhand. Orange dust storm warnings: Rajasthan.

Yellow thunderstorm and lightning warnings: Across central, northeastern, and southern India. Officials could update and extend the coverage of weather alerts over the coming days. Sustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where heavy rain has saturated the soil. Authorities could issue mandatory evacuation orders for flood-prone communities over the coming days. Disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible where significant flooding or landslides impact utility networks. Floodwaters and debris flows may render some bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Severe weather could also trigger flight delays and cancellations at regional airports. Localized business disruptions may occur in low-lying areas; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of flood damage to facilities, possible evacuations, and some employees' inability to reach work sites. Flooding could heighten the threat of disease outbreaks. Backflow from drains mixed with floodwaters can become trapped in open areas when inundations recede. These stagnant pools often become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and bacteria, increasing the incidence of insect- and water-borne diseases. Exposure to contaminated water from inundated industrial sites, sewer systems, and septic tanks also poses a significant health threat. Monitor local media for weather-related updates and advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business arrangements before traveling in the affected area. Seek updated information on road conditions before driving or routing shipments through areas where severe weather is forecast; plan for possible supply chain disruptions throughout the affected areas. Stay away from elevated streams, creeks, and other watercourses that are prone to flash flooding. Do not attempt to navigate flooded roadways. Exercise caution in elevated terrain due to the threat of landslides, as well as mountainous regions where avalanches pose a threat. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

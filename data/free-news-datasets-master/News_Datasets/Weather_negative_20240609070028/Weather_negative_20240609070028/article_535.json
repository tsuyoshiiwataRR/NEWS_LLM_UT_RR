    "text": "A tornado ripped through Bunbury in Western Australia, about 150 kms south of Perth, on Friday. Local media reports and residents of the city said that the twister caused severe damage to property and wrecked a community centre where at least 50 children were present. This comes as the United States is battling severe thunderstorm weather and tornadoes for over a month now. Several US states, including Michigan, Texas, Florida, Nebraska, Ohio, Iowa, have been affected by tornadoes. Damage to property and injuries have been reported. As Australia witnessed a massive tornado on Friday afternoon, several social media users asked if the bad weather is connected to the storm spree in the United States.

When asked 'Can tornadoes in the US cause tornadoes in Australia?' - the chatbot said: \\\"No, a tornado in the US cannot directly cause a tornado in Australia. Tornadoes are local phenomena that depend on specific atmospheric conditions in their immediate area.\\\"It further listed reasons, saying the massive distance between the two countries would make it impossible. Here's where we tried to understand the weather and wind patterns. When asked, 'if weather in the United States influence the weather in Australia?', Google's Gemini said: \\\"Yes, to a certain extent, weather in the US can influence weather in Australia, but not in the way a single event like a tornado can directly cause another.\\\"Read More: San Marcos Tornado: Texas City On Alert, Warning Issued In AustinThe chatbot added that the movement of 'air masses around the globe can influence weather patterns in distant locations. For instance, the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) impacts both the US and Australia'.However, it is important to note that the influence of US weather on Australia is indirect. Hence, the Bunbury tornado was likely not influenced by the storm spree in the United States.",

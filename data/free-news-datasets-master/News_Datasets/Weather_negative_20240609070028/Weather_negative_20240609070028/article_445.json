    "text": "A heavy rain and flash flooding warning has been issued across NSW as up to 200 millimetres of rain is predicted to fall in some areas. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) is predicting the South Coast, Illawarra and Southern Tablelands will receive the heaviest rain on Saturday and continue into Sunday. There is the potential for up to 200 millimetres to fall over 24 hours. 18:20 AEST18:25 AEST18:30 AEST18:35 AEST18:40 AEST18:45 AEST18:50 AEST \"What's going to happen this afternoon is the rain band with these embedded thunderstorms is forecast to continue moving eastward while shifting the focus to the coast,\" BoM Meteorologist Sarah Scully said. Scully said there was the potential for severe thunderstorms in the Sydney metropolitan area and the Illawarra, that may lead to flash flooding. \"Grounds are really wet across this region due to recent rain fall and that increases the chance of both flash and riverine flooding. \"This heavy rainfall is forecast to continue into Sunday as the onshore flow pushes into the coast, whereas further north, that rain band will start to push out and clear from northern parts. \"It's not really until Monday however, that the rain really clears the southern and central parts of the coast.\" A flood watch has been issued for minor riverine flooding in the Hawkesbury Nepean Valley and South Coast from Saturday. The State Emergency Service (SES) is warning residents to take proactive measures to ensure their safety. NSW SES Assistant Commissioner Nicole Hogan said the main risk associated with the forecast was flash flooding but minor riverine rises were possible. \"We're closely monitoring the weather and are prepared to respond swiftly to any emergencies that may arise,\" Hogan said. \"Our teams are on standby, and we have prepositioned people and assets to assist the community and mitigate the impacts of heavy rainfall.\" It has rained in Sydney every day this month so far, causing the city to receive its entire May rainfall average in just six days.",

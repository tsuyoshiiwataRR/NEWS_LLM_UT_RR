    "text": "The Met Office has issued a thunderstorm warning across Gloucestershire, signalling a dramatic end to this week&apos;s warm and sunny weather. The severe weather alert is in place from noon to 10pm on Sunday, May 12 and warns of thunder and lightning, heavy rain and the possibility for flooded properties.\nAfter weeks of rain and lower-than-usual temperatures, many hoped the current wave of sunshine and warmth would last longer than a week. However, meteorologists say up to 50mm of rain could fall in just two hours on Sunday - but it is still predicted to be 23C.\nThe forecaster says: \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms could lead to some disruption in places, especially to travel. Isolated property flooding is possible.\" According to the Met Office, the storms will begin in the south and move north throughout the day, as reports Bristol Live .\nRead More - Storm from Bermuda heading to UK with 55mph winds and temperature drop\nRead More - Tributes to Cotswolds dad who died in car crash while celebrating 50th wedding anniversary\nIt adds: \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms are likely to break out in the south of this area late Sunday morning and early Sunday afternoon, moving steadily north while growing into larger areas of rain before clearing the area.\"\n\"Some intense downpours are possible in a few places, giving up to 30 mm in less than hour and perhaps 40-50 mm over two to three hours leading to surface water flooding. Hail, frequent lightning strikes and strong wind gusts will be additional localised hazards.\"\nThe Met Office is expecting a change in the weather outlook from Sunday onwards, due to a developing low-pressure system from the Atlantic. Deputy Chief Meteorologist Tony Wisson said: “Many places will start fine and warm on Sunday, though it is likely to become cloudier from the west or southwest during the day. This will be accompanied by scattered showers, which could be heavy with thunder.\n“On Monday we&apos;re likely to see more widespread and longer-lived spells of rain, some of which will be heavy and thundery. This will also lead to a much cooler feel to the day.”\nIn Gloucestershire, we can expect highs of 24C today (Friday, May 10) with the mercury again hitting 24C on Saturday. Sunday could see 25C, but some light showers.\nMonday will see that temperature drop to highs of 17C with an overcast day and some heavy showers around lunchtime. Tuesday will see another overcast day to start, changing to light showers by late morning.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

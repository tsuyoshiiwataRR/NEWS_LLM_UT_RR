The severe weather alert is in place from noon to 10pm on Sunday, May 12 and warns of thunder and lightning, heavy rain and the possibility for flooded properties.\nAfter weeks of rain and lower-than-usual temperatures, many hoped the current wave of sunshine and warmth would last longer than a week. However, meteorologists say up to 50mm of rain could fall in just two hours on Sunday - but it is still predicted to be 23C.\nThe forecaster says: \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms could lead to some disruption in places, especially to travel. Isolated property flooding is possible.\"\nAccording to the Met Office, the storms will begin in the south and move north throughout the day. It adds: \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms are likely to break out in the south of this area late Sunday morning and early Sunday afternoon, moving steadily north while growing into larger areas of rain before clearing the area.\"\n\"Some intense downpours are possible in a few places, giving up to 30 mm in less than hour and perhaps 40-50 mm over two to three hours leading to surface water flooding. Hail, frequent lightning strikes and strong wind gusts will be additional localised hazards.\"\nDespite the forecasted heavy rain and storms, temperatures are predicted to remain high. Bristol is set to reach a balmy 23C on Sunday, with some parts of the UK potentially seeing highs of 26C.\nHowever, these soaring temperatures are expected to drop following the storm, returning to the more typical mid-high teens usually seen throughout May.\n⚠️ Want the latest Devon breaking news and top stories first?

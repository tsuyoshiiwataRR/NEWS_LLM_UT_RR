    "text": "BEAUFORT â€” A strong thunderstorm system is expected to bring damaging winds and hail to the Lowcountry on Thursday afternoon, May 9.\nAt 3:10 p.m. on May 9, the National Weather Service warned of a strong line of thunderstorms from Dale to Hardeeville, moving southeast at 25 mph. Beaufort, Charleston, Colleton and southeastern Jasper Counties may see winds up 55 mph and penny sized hail.\nThe possibility of one or more isolated tornadoes in the Savannah River area cannot be ruled out, according to a\nSouth Carolina Department of Natural Resources bulletin issued in the morning. Shortly after noon on May 9, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch that will remain in effect until 7 p.m. for eight counties in the southeast portion of the state: Allendale, Beaufort, Berkeley, Charleston, Colleton, Dorchester, Hampton and Jasper counties.\nStorms are predicted to first strike the western part of the state early in the afternoon and progress east. The coastal region should start to experience the effects of the storm between 3 and 4 p.m. The storms will continue their eastward track, taking them offshore later this afternoon.\nThe\nNational Weather Service Storm Prediction Center shows the highest risk for severe storms is over the southern part of the state. There is an enhanced threat risk of severe storms for all of Beaufort and Jasper counties, which is the third tier of a five-tier risk scale.\nWinds measuring up to 60 mph are the primary threat from the storm. By comparison, a Category 1 hurricane has a minimum sustained wind speed of 74 mph. Large hail measuring more that 1 inch in diameter, heavy rain and minor local flooding are also possible.\nIn preparation for the severe weather, the Beaufort County School District canceled all afterschool activities, including district childcare.\nHours after this system moves out, a cold front is expected to move into the region May 10, ushering in a second round of storms. Those storms could become severe in the morning or into the afternoon.\nThere is a level 2, or elevated, risk for severe storms on May 10, according to the\nStorm Prediction Center.\nThere is some good news in all of this unsettled weather. DNR predicts cooler and drier air for the weekend, though rain could return as early as the night of May 13.",

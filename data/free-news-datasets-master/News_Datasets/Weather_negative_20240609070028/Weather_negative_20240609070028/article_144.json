    "text": "OOLTEWAH, Tenn. â€” The [recent severe storms](https://newschannel9.com/news/local/strong-storms-down-trees-cause-flooding-and-knock-out-power-throughout-our-viewing-area#) were enough excitement, but residents in one Ooltewah neighborhood were also forced to shelter in place while deputies tried to arrest a man with a gun. In the early morning hours Thursday, deputies headed to the 3200 block of Cobblestone Hill Drive after getting reports that a man was walking through the neighborhood firing a rifle, according to a release from the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office (HCSO). When they arrived, deputies were told the suspect had gone back inside his home. They then set up a perimeter to keep the suspect from escaping, and called in a SWAT team. They also told all nearby residents to shelter in place for their own safety. After several hours, HCSO says the man, later identified as 64-year-old Steve Edward Garrison, turned himself in. Garrison is now charged with disorderly conduct and 2 counts of felony reckless endangerment. HCSO's release says, \"The HCSO would like to thank the residents impacted by this call for their patience while our personnel resolved this critical incident. The HCSO would also like to thank members of the Tri-Community Volunteer Fire Department and HCEMS for their support throughout this incident.\"",

    "text": "After Saudi Arabia, heavy rain is continuing in Dubai as well. Heavy rains have disrupted life in Dubai, Sharjah and other states. A public safety alert has also been issued by the Dubai Police, with the police instructing citizens to be cautious and avoid unnecessary travel. A number of tankers and motors have been installed on major highways of Dubai to drain rainwater, while measures have also been taken to prevent the spread of mud and sand along with the water. Special roadblocks have been made from polythene bags to maintain the flow of traffic. Due to torrential rains in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, educational institutions have been instructed to conduct 2-day online classes and work from home in private offices, while a yellow alert has been issued for rain. Ajman Police has increased its presence on various internal and external roads to deal with the heavy rains and provide assistance to the public. Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority has suspended intercity bus services to Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman and other emirates. On the other hand, heavy rains have also affected the flight operations, according to the airport authorities, 5 flights have been diverted and 13 flights have been canceled due to bad weather. Traffic flow on the roads around Dubai Airport is also affected. The airport authorities have instructed the passengers to come to the airport after getting complete information about the flights. While the passengers have been instructed to reach Terminal 1 and Terminal 3 through Komero. While the national airline “PIA” has issued important instructions for passengers going to and returning from the United Arab Emirates. A spokesperson of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) says that air operations to Dubai and Sharjah are severely affected due to heavy rains. The spokesman said that the air operations of PIA and other airlines for Dubai and Sharjah will remain suspended until further notice. Spokesperson PIA said that some flights of the national airline are facing delays and cancellations. It should be remembered that even in April, life was badly affected by heavy rains in the United Arab Emirates including Dubai. #Heavy #rains #Dubai #roads #turned #ponds #flight #operations #affected # World 2024-05-10 04:33:44 Related posts: the parents of these stars are LGBTQ Morning Habits of Successful Leaders: Unveiling the Secrets to Achieving Unattainable Heights \"Intelligence Directorate Raids Drug Trafficking and Robbery Gang - Arrests Made in Choueifat Desert...

    "text": "The death toll in floods across a large part of southern Germany rose to five on June 4 as more bodies were recovered from inundated areas. Six residents and a 22-year-old firefighter remain missing, regional authorities say German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited the flooded region and officials warned that water levels could rise further in some areas. The River Danube is the centre of concern for rescue efforts, with high levels of water passing through the city of Regensburg, following an evacuation effort the evening before. The level of the Danube had reached 9.6 metres in Passau, according to the Bavarian State Environmental Office, almost double the normal level for this time of year. Three rivers meet in the historic university town, where authorities have stopped motorised traffic and emptied underground car parks. In Bavaria, more than 52,000 emergency workers have been deployed, most of them volunteers, the firefighters' association said. But it added the vast area of flooding posed challenges for them. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that \"this is not just one event like there have been for centuries,\" and that a succession of floods in recent times shows \"we cannot neglect the task of halting man-made climate change\". Lava continued to spurt from a volcano in south-western Iceland on May 30 but the activity had calmed significantly from when it erupted a day earlier. The eruption was the fifth and most powerful since the volcanic system near Grindavik reawakened in December after 800 years, gushing record levels of lava as its fissure grew to 3.5km in length. Volcanologist Dave McGarvie calculated that the amount of lava initially flowing from the crater could have buried the soccer pitch at Wembley Stadium in London under 15 metres of lava every minute. \"These jets of magma are reaching like 50 metres, into the atmosphere,\" McGarvie, an honorary researcher at Lancaster University, said. \"That just immediately strikes me as a powerful eruption. And that was my first impression ... then some numbers came out, estimating how much was coming out per minute or per second and it was, 'wow.'\" The activity once again threatened Grindavik, a coastal town of 3800 people, and led to the evacuation of the popular Blue Lagoon geothermal spa, one of Iceland's biggest tourist attractions. Grindavik, which is about 50km southwest of Iceland's capital, Reykjavik, has been threatened since a swarm of earthquakes in November forced an evacuation in advance of the initial December 18 eruption. A subsequent eruption consumed several buildings. Protective barriers outside Grindavik deflected the lava Wednesday but the evacuated town remained without electricity and two of the three roads into town were inundated with lava. McGarvie said the eruption was more powerful than the four that preceded it because the largest amount of magma had accumulated in a chamber underground before breaking the earth's surface and shooting into the sky. The rapid and powerful start of the eruption followed by it diminishing quickly several hours later is the pattern researchers have witnessed with this volcano, McGarvie said. It was unknown when eruptions at this volcano will end. \"It could go on for quite some considerable time,\" McGarvie said. \"We're really in new territory here because eruptions like this have never been witnessed, carefully, in this part of Iceland.\" Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas in late May after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central US . The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the north-west corner of Arkansas. Pictured is a man looking what remains of buildings in Valley View, Texas. Damage is seen at a truck stop the morning after a tornado rolled through, in Valley View, Texas. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky',” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Damage is seen at Tom Jones' home after the roof blew off during a storm, in Claremore, Oklahoma. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes\". Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado ploughed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said at a news conference. The Home Town Flea Market was severely damaged from the storm on May 26, 2024, in Rogers, Arkansas. Bangladesh evacuated nearly 800,000 people from vulnerable areas as the country and neighbouring India awaited the arrival of a severe cyclone that has formed over the Bay of Bengal. The storm is expected to cross Bangladesh and India's West Bengal coasts late on Sunday (Monday AEST). The India Meteorological Department said it is expected to reach maximum wind speeds of up to 120km/h, hitting West Bengal's Sagar Island and Bangladesh's Khepupara region. In this satellite photo from the India Meteorological Department, cyclonic activity is visible over the Bay of Bengal on the eastern coast of India. This is the first cyclone in the Bay of Bengal ahead of this year's monsoon season, which runs from June to September. Moderate to heavy rainfall is expected in most places over coastal districts in India's West Bengal state. A storm surge about one metre high is expected to flood low-lying areas of coastal West Bengal and Bangladesh. The powerful storms can uproot trees and cause major damage to thatched homes and power and communication lines. India's coasts are often hit by cyclones, but changing climate patterns have caused them to become more intense, making preparations for natural disasters more urgent. Powerful storms that rolled through the US Midwest spun up multiple tornadoes, including a fierce twister that smashed through a small Iowa town on Tuesday, carving a bleak landscape of destroyed homes and businesses, toppled trees, smashed cars and widely strewn debris and causing an unknown number of injuries. Pictured is a damaged wind turbine north of Prescott, Iowa, on May 21, 2024. Multiple people were injured in Greenfield, a town of about 2000 around 90 kilometres southwest of Des Moines, Iowa State Patrol spokesman Sgt Alex Dinkla said. He didn't know the extent of the injuries. In the aftermath of the storm, parts of Greenfield appeared devastated. Mounds of broken wood, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood.",

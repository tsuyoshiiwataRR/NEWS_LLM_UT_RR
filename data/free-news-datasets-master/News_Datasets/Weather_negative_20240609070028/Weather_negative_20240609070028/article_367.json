    "text": "Spring had a rather wonky start even with the late-season storm last weekend, but the swing to summer heat this weekend will show little mercy and leave no time to acclimate. The time to acclimate is key while tolerating the heat, especially late in the summer months. Eric Kurth, a lead meteorologist at the National Weather Service (NWS) in Sacramento, says the heat this time of year doesnâ€™t have to set records for it to be a heat people need to pay attention to, especially if they are doing outdoor activities. One challenge for forecasting the impacts of heat is the time of year and the weather so far that season. For us, the transition to summer-like weather may be a bit harder given the cooler conditions so far this spring. Kurth says the heat this time of year is very different from the heat in August and September when we are all acclimated to it. One thing that the National Weather Service uses to communicate the risk of heat is a product known as heat risk. This takes into account the time of year and the climatology of a local area. For us, we are seeing a moderate heat risk coming up this weekend, the first one of the season. The moderate heat risk means people impacted by the heat are the elderly, unhoused, and those most sensitive to heat-related health problems. Kurth says those sensitive groups really need to be aware this weekend and it even looks like through much of next week we are expecting temperatures to be elevated. Other categories include red for major impacts and magenta for extreme impacts in significant and prolonged periods of heat. With the prospect of the 90s, something to be aware of is keeping out of local waterways fed by snowmelt. The NWS says the air may be warm, but the water is still running cold, which can have detrimental health effects if you stay in too long. The NWS also says now is the time to check your AC to make sure it works and to drink enough water heading into the weekend. The good news is that as temperatures rise, pollen production begins to shut down for some plants as they dry out.",

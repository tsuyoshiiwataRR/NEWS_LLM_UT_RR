    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) – The ALERT day is still in place for the Valley despite finally seeing much drier and calmer conditions following the rounds of severe storms that moved through earlier today. The calm conditions won’t last long as another round of strong to severe storms will impact the Valley later tonight and well into Friday morning. This has prompted the National Weather Service to issue a Severe Thunderstorm Watch for our East Alabama Counties until 11:00 PM CT. The first round of strong storms moves in late tonight from the west and pushes eastward, meaning it’s likely everyone will see rain/storms at some point tonight into tomorrow. Since this is an overnight severe weather event for our area, it is VERY IMPORTANT to have a way to get alerts that can wake you up if any of these storms do turn severe. The main concerns for tonight/tomorrow’s severe weather are mainly pockets of damaging winds and widespread rainfall. The chance of hail and tornado is still there but much lower… BUT NOT ZERO. Plan on sporadic power outages possibly. The Valley will dry out in the late morning hours leading to a very pleasant Friday with clouds clearing out and highs in the mid-80s. The nice weather continues for Mother’s Day weekend as well! By Saturday morning, we’ll wake up to a clear sky and temperatures in the mid to upper 50s. A pleasant afternoon is expected as we top out around 80 degrees. Sunday is about the same; it looks to be just a couple of degrees warmer and a few more clouds perhaps. Active weather is possible again next week at times, especially Monday night and Tuesday the way it looks right now. Rain and storms may linger at times for the rest of the workweek.",

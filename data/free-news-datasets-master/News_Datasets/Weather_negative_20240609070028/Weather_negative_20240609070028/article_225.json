    "text": "Dothan Utilities warns of downed power lines ahead of overnight severe weather DOTHAN, Ala. (WTVY) - It is important to be aware [on this 4Warn Weather Night](https://www.wtvy.com/2024/05/08/4warn-weather-night-declared-thursday-may-9-into-friday-may-10/) and that includes safety. The thing drivers and everyone should be cautious of are downed power lines. Dothan Utilities tells News4 it’s always prepared for these scenarios but it is important to educate the public on this matter. “Electricity is something that you can’t see. It is very dangerous and deadly,” Chris Phillips, the assistant director of electrical operations at Dothan Utilities, said. In the U.S., of the electrocution deaths that happen every year, most of them are caused by downed power lines. Phillips says in the aftermath of severe weather, everyone should be on the lookout. “When it comes to downed power lines, stay away. It is difficult to differentiate a downed power line and a cable line so the best approach is to stay away from any downed line and report them as quickly as you can,” Phillips said. It is recommended to stay at least 35 feet away from a downed power line, and to never assume even when there are no sparks and do not attempt to drive over them. “After a storm event occurs, it is very important to know that powerlines could potentially be energized and the best approach is to call Dothan Utilities or call 911 if there is a hazard and it is across the roadway,” Phillips said. If you are ever in a situation where a line falls on your car, stay inside and call 911. If the vehicle becomes unsafe, you must jump from the vehicle with your feet together. It is important to never touch the car and the ground at the same time.

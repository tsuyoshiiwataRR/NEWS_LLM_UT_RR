    "text": "Because the economy hasn't been crippled enough by idiotic policies, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is looking to hold oil and gas companies accountable for the weather not being nice enough, or something like that. The weather's never too bad for [excessive tailgating](https://twitchy.com/dougp/2021/11/11/michigan-ag-dana-nessels-statement-about-getting-very-drunk-at-the-michmich-st-game-is-something-else-n2091230), but otherwise, Whitmer's AG might make a move that would please their fellow climate change alarmists: Nessel plans to sue oil and gas companies over Michigan's changing climate— The Detroit News (@detroitnews) [https://t.co/Cakwep7qnx] [May 9, 2024] Alternate headline for [this story](https://www.wxyz.com/news/ag-dana-nessel-plans-to-sue-fossil-fuel-companies-over-climate-change-effects-on-michigan): Michigan Attorney General Planning to Sue Fossil Fuel Companies for Making the Weather Worse: In a release issued Thursday, Nessel said her office is pursuing litigation related to climate change impacts on the state caused by the fossil fuel industry. The AG's office is also seeking proposals from attorneys and law firms to serve as special assistant attorneys general to help in the litigation. She said that the \"Pure Michigan\" identity is under threat because of climate change. The state's slogan under this bunch should be changed to \"Pure Insanity.\" It's all about raising taxes and fees to make up for the money the state's losing due to people fleeing Whitmer's Mitten Utopia. This is the \"where it gets awkward\" part... Recommended I can't help but wonder if Nessel's lawsuit will include Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. It won't surprise anybody to know that she's a hypocrite (which we learned during the Covid shutdowns). Maybe Whitmer could use her oil and gas connections to convince them to make the weather better: Gretchen Whitmer has over $1 million invested in oil companies, financial disclosure shows— The Midwesterner (@Th_Midwesterner) [https://t.co/AonfjqMKBu]via [@Th_Midwesterner] [April 18, 2024] When there's not much else, there's always a bunch of hypocrisy with these people. Will Nessel also sue the governor? I didn’t have Governor Whitmer investing $1M in big oil on my BINGO card today, but here we are with that— Heather Dow (@PatriotPostGirl) [#PureMichiganHypocrisy] [https://t.co/66eWtquorO] [pic.twitter.com/uYPjykXfKG] [April 18, 2024] [April 18, 2024] As usual, mansions, private jets and SUVs for them -- tiny houses, electric golf carts and an insect diet [for you](https://www.themidwesterner.news/2024/04/gretchen-whitmer-has-over-1-million-invested-in-oil-companies-financial-disclosure-shows/): Whitmer’s financial investments in those oil companies seemingly conflict with her efforts in Michigan to invest billions of taxpayer dollars in the electric vehicle industry. In recent years, the Whitmer administration has inked investment packages that will steer $236.6 million in taxpayer money to a Next Energy battery gigafactory in Novi, $800 million for a CCP Gotion battery parts plant near Big Rapids, and $1.7 billion for Ford’s BlueOval Battery Park in southwest Michigan, MLive reports. Laughably, Gov. Whitmer has put together a commission designed to figure out why people are moving out of Michigan at a greater rate than they're moving in. I'm assuming that commission will cost taxpayers a lot of money when all Whitmer has to do to get an answer to that question is go look in a mirror.",

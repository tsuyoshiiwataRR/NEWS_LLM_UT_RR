    "text": "National Weather Service confirms EF-2 tornado in St. Joseph County, Mich. ST. JOSEPH COUNTY/BRANCH COUNTY, Mich. (WNDU) - The National Weather Service (NWS) has confirmed that [an EF-2 tornado touched down](https://twitter.com/NWSIWX/status/1788669083090915782/photo/1) in St. Joseph County, Mich., on Tuesday evening. According to NWS, the tornado touched down at 5:41 p.m. on the south side of Centreville and traveled northeast toward Union City in neighboring Branch County for nearly 20 miles. The storm packed winds of 130 mph and stayed on the ground for 30 minutes before weakening and lifting just south of Union Lake. NWS says the most significant damage from the tornado is north of Colon to north of Sherwood. Several homes reportedly lost roofs and walls, and many trees were uprooted. Fortunately, no deaths were reported. However, there was one injury near Colon. According to [our sister station WOOD-TV](https://www.woodtv.com/weather/weather-news/national-weather-service-confirms-ef2-tornado-in-portage-tuesday/), this tornado prompted the [first tornado emergency ever issued in Michigan](https://www.wndu.com/2024/05/08/whitmer-declares-state-emergency-southwest-michigan-after-tornadoes-severe-storms/).

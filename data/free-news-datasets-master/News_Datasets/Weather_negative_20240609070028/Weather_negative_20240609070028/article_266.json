The downpour threw normal life out of gear in the Someshwar area of Almora district, too, where debris entered several houses. The Almora-Kausani highway that connects Almora with Bageshwar district also got blocked due to the accumulation of slush brought by sudden rainfall. A similar situation was witnessed in Uttarkashi’s Purola region where the sudden downpour caused a flashflood-like situation in Kumola and Hudoli streams, causing the water level to rise quickly and alarming residents of nearby areas. As a precautionary measure, the district administration temporarily halted vehicle movement over the Hudoli stream until the water receded. Devendra Patwal, the area’s district disaster management officer, confirmed that despite the swelling of streams, there was no loss of life or property. However, locals living close to these water bodies have been warned to remain vigilant due to the weather conditions. As per the Met office, Kapkot received 45 mm rain, Garud 40 mm, and Bageshwar city 36 mm. In Uttarkashi district, Chinyalisaur received 15 mm rain, followed by 10 mm in Mori area of the district. Significantly, the Met centre has issued a yellow alert of rain, thunderstorm and lightning activities across the state till May 13.

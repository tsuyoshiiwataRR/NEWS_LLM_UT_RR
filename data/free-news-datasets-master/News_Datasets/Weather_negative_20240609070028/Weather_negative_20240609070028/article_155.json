    "text": "Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists.\nS&a;#8203;pring and summer are the deadliest time of year for weather hazards in the U.S., and while natural disasters like tornadoes and hurricanes often make the biggest headlines, there are a few types weather-related phenomena that fly under the radar and account for a large number of deaths annually.\nK&a;#8203;eep these threats and safety tips in mind through the coming months.\nBeachgoers face and underrated weather danger that kills dozens annually . Rip currents killed an average of 71 people each year from 2013 to 2022, the third most for any category of weather-related fatalities in NOAA&s;s statistics.\nRip currents can develop at any beach with breaking waves , and in the five years ending in 2022, most states along the Gulf, East and West coasts as well as along the Great Lakes shoreline have had deaths related to rip currents. Florida has the most deaths by far with 105, followed by North Carolina and Texas with 29 and 28, respectively.\nTips to protect your safety at the beach: Take note of the rip current risk if you are planning a day at the beach. There are color-coded flags placed on many beaches each day to communicate the current threat. You can also get a daily rip current forecast from NOAA .\nE&a;#8203;xtreme heat leads the way when it comes to weather-related deaths. There has been an average of 176 heat-related deaths each year in the U.S., according to the 2013-2022 average from NOAA&s;s Natural Hazard Statistics.\nOne of last year&s;s billion-dollar disasters - heat and drought in the Midwest and South - should serve as a reminder since 247 people were killed by it from spring through fall , primarily because of excessive heat.\nTips to stay safe from extreme heat: Heat safety should be a priority in summer by taking these precautions : Stay hydrated and take breaks if outdoors. Check on vulnerable people such as the elderly and children, especially if air conditioning is unavailable.\nF&a;#8203;looding is usually the biggest storm-related killer. NOAA says an average of 104 deaths per year have been caused by flooding, or more than twice the average of tornadoes. In recent years, the toll has been as high as 189 deaths in 2015 and 146 fatalities in 2021.\nFlooding can happen anytime of year, but warmer temperatures from spring into summer make it more likely because of the potential for heavier rainfall rates. In fact, flash flooding in the U.S. has an annual peak that occurs from late-spring through summer.\nTip to stay safe from floods: When heavy rain threatens, never try to drive through a flooded road. Over half of deaths in floods happen in vehicles, according to NOAA statistics .\nB&a;#8203;e aware of lightning when planning outdoor activities. Deaths from lightning have decreased when compared to decades ago , but an average of 22 people have still lost their life annually from 2013 to 2022. Hundreds more people are injured , NOAA says.\nM&a;#8203;ore people are outdoors in spring and summer, so a majority of lightning deaths happen during this time of year.\nL&a;#8203;ast year had the fewest lightning deaths on record with 14. The decrease in the death toll from lightning in recent years is a testament to technology, including lightning detection, improved forecasting and increased awareness.\nTips to protect yourself from lightning: If you have outdoor activities planned, be sure you know where you can shelter from lightning. If you hear thunder, then it&s;s time to move indoors no matter how faint or loud it sounds.\nChris Dolce has been a senior meteorologist with weather.com for over 10 years after beginning his career with The Weather Channel in the early 2000s.\n\\n",

    "text": "Meteorologists predict this oppressive heat will persist for the foreseeable future, exacerbating the challenges faced by locals. Nighttime may offer slight respite, with temperatures expected to dip to approximately 22 degrees Celsius, accompanied by cloudy skies.\nHowever, any relief may be short-lived, as the likelihood of thunderstorms looms. Nashik finds itself in step with neighboring cities such as Pune and Kolhapur, which have already experienced bouts of thunderous weather. Reflecting on May 8th, Nashik experienced a daytime high of 37 degrees Celsius, with nighttime temperatures dropping to 23 degrees Celsius. Despite the decrease in temperature, humidity remained at a stifling 35 percent, amplifying the sensation of heat. Residents of Nashik eagerly anticipate the arrival of monsoon rains, yearning for respite from the relentless heat. With exhaustion mounting from the prolonged high temperatures, the collective hope is for precipitation to arrive promptly and alleviate the oppressive conditions.",

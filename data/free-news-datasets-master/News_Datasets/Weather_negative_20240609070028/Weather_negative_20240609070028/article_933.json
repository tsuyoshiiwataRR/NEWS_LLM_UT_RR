    "text": "New Delhi: The National Capital Territory of Delhi and its adjoining areas witnessed a massive dust storm on Friday night, with gusty winds of up to 50-70 Km/h windspeeds occurring over the entire NCR. Loni Dehat, Hindon AF Station, Ghaziabad, Indirapuram, Chhapraula, Noida, Dadri, Greater Noida, Gurugram, Faridabad, Manesar, Ballabhgarh, Gohana, Gannaur, Sonipat, Rohtak, Kharkhoda (Haryana) Baraut, Bagpat, Khekra (UP), were among the areas affected.As per the Met Department, light intensity rain/drizzle is expected over and adjoining areas of Kaithal, Narwana, Rajaund, Assandh, Safidon, Barwala, Jind, Hissar, Hansi, Siwani, Meham, Tosham (Haryana) during next 2 hours.As the winds hit the region, users stormed the social media with funny memes over sudden change of weather in Delhi.One of the users said, \\\"NCR turned into Dubai\\\", while another posted a photo of Akshay Kumar and Johnny Lever covered in dust saying ,\\\"Delhi & NCRS PEOPLE\\\". \\\"Delhi NCR right now,\\\" an X user said while sharing photo of the popular doge coin dog in a form of a massive storm.\\\"Baat maan bhai yeh photo Dilli ka hai!\\\" said another posting a photo of a desert as dust storm engulfed Delhi.\\\"Looks like Avengers are finally arriving ðŸ›¬ in India,\\\" a user posted.The strong winds led to stalled traffic in the city and flight diversions to nearby airports.As the dust storm hits Delhi-NCR and surrounding regions, authorities warn of potential repercussions on various fronts. Strong winds accompanying the storm pose risks to agriculture, with potential damage to plantation, horticulture, and standing crops anticipated.Additionally, vulnerable structures may experience partial damage due to the force of the winds, while kutcha houses, walls, and huts are at risk of minor damage. Loose objects may become airborne, heightening the potential for harm.In light of these warnings, authorities advise residents to take precautionary measures. It is recommended to stay indoors, close windows and doors, and refrain from unnecessary travel if feasible. Seeking safe shelters is advised, with individuals urged not to take refuge under trees due to the risks posed by falling branches or debris.As the region braces for the approaching dust storm, residents are encouraged to remain vigilant and adhere to safety guidelines to mitigate potential risks to life and property.",

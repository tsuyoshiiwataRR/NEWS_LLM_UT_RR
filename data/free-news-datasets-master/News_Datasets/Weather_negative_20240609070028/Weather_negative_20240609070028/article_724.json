    "text": "Perth’s balmy autumn is due to end with a clout this week with severe thunderstorms, heavy rain and even hail set to batter parts of the State.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather warning for an area from Geraldton to Albany — including Perth — as a cold front develops.\nThe Bureau’s Angus Hines said the “vigorous” front is forecast to arrive on Friday striking coastal areas of WA.\n“These places across the South West, if you do see severe thunderstorms on Friday, could come with heavy rain which could cause areas of flash flooding,” he said.\n “They could come with damaging winds which can bring down trees and cause power outages and the potential is even there for some large hail which could damage property and could damage crops as well.”\nSome parts of the State could be drenched with 30mm to 40mm of rain, but most areas are forecast to receive just 10mm in showers.\nIn disheartening news for WA farmers, Mr Hines said the front was tipped to be “quite restricted”, moving south before it could reach the State’s parched agricultural regions.\n“Many parts of Western Australia, including the Wheatbelt are going to miss out on much-needed rain,” he said.\nWhile winter is only weeks away, Mr Hines pointed out temperatures remained up to five degrees above average for this time of year. WA has also recorded unseasonably high fire danger ratings well into May.\nThe cold front is tipped to reduce temperatures across parts of the State, but he said it wouldn’t be a “drastic cooling”, with maximum temperatures forecast to stay 24C and above until at least next Wednesday.\nPERTH FORECAST Today: 27C, cloudy\nTomorrow: 24C, showers, possible storm\nSaturday: 25C, partly cloudy\nSunday: 25C, shower or two\nMonday: 24C, shower or two\nTuesday: 24C, partly cloudy\nWednesday: 24C, mostly sunny",

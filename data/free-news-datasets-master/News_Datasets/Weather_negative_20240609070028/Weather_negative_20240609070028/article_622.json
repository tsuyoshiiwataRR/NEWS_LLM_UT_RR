    "text": "By Mike Rizzo ,\n8 minutes ago\nThere is a coastal flood advisory in effect for the high tide cycles tonight due to the easterly wind and New Moon tides that will cause very minor flooding due to a higher cycle. Showers continue on and off today. The weather is moving faster than predicted and should depart between 10 p.m. and midnight tonight. Temperatures remain in the mid-50s throughout the day.\nTomorrow starts sunny and the weather remains beautiful with a chance for a p.m. cloud or spot shower over the higher elevations north and west in the late afternoon. Highs will be in the lower 60s.\nSunday will be rainy again, with showers moving across New Jersey throughout much of the morning and early afternoon. Conditions improve slowly by the evening and then sunshine returns for Monday and Tuesday. Sunday's temperatures will be cool again.\nMonday's weather warms a bit into the mid-70s. Same for Tuesday with the next round of rain arriving Tuesday night into Wednesday.\nAurora forecast An unusual and rare Coronal Mass Ejection (solar flare) erupted out of the surface of the sun yesterday. This flare send a magnetic field and other particles from the sun toward Earth. They are expected to arrive sometime tonight and through the weekend. Should the timing align with nighttime, Aurora Borealis, AKA the Northern Lights can be very vibrant over the northern hemisphere and they can move farther south than usual. Given the unusual and rare nature of this particular CME/Solar Flare, the aurora can be far enough to be seen along the horizon at higher elevations in Northern New Jersey.\nHistorically, it has been known that the strongest aurora within these types of events can sometimes be seen as far south as the Carolinas and Alabama. Aurora is not easily predictable and does not last the entire nighttime. They arrive, pop up, strengthen, move, and dissipate at unpredictable intervals and intensity. Sometimes we can have a 30 min lead-time in seeing that some measurements are rising but does not always indicate that aurora will be strong on our side of the planet or close to our area. Often, for New Jersey, aurora in these types of storms can be seen low on the horizon, using a camera with a long exposure, at a higher elevation.\nDon't expect aurora to be directly overhead - we'd need an \"extreme\" level storm to even get a better chance of that. Consider this just a greater possibility of seeing a faint green glow on the northern horizon if viewing at nighttime without the pollution of city lights. Lastly, this type of geomagnetic storm can interrupt GPS, radio, and wireless communication functions the closer to the northern poles. This could make GPS act a bit wonky, especially. NOAA is expected to have media advisory and information here .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

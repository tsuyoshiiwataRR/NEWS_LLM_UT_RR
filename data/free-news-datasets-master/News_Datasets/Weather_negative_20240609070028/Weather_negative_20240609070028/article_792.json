    "text": "Dallas weather: May 10 Afternoon Forecast FOX 4's Dylan Federico has a look at the chance we could spot the northern lights this weekend.\nWe have a storm-free Friday forecast , but the weekend could see some rain, especially on Sunday.\nFriday Forecast: Best Weather of the Week! The record-tying heat is going and the humidity has dropped.\nHigh temperatures will peak around 80 degrees on Friday afternoon and there will be a nice breeze.\nAfter the weather we&apos;ve seen lately, we&apos;ll certainly take it.\nFeatured\narticle Northern lights could be visible in Texas due to severe solar storm Texas knows a thing or two about Friday night lights, but this weekend we could see something truly special.\nSaturday Forecast: Some Rain Possible West A storm system is expected to move into North Texas from the desert southwest.\nA lead disturbance ahead of the parent storm system is expected to cause some showers and rumbles of thunder on Friday afternoon.\nThat rain is most likely only to the west of I-35W, but it could peter out as it moves east.\nSunday Forecast: Mother's Day Rain? The main storm system will lift overhead on Sunday and bring rain.\nThe showers will be widespread on Sunday, but it&apos;s important to know it is not a washout.\nThere will likely be some pockets of heavier rain and some small hail in some of the strongest storms.\nOverall, the severe weather threat on Sunday is low.\n7-Day Forecast The rain is expected to stick around a bit on Monday.\nTemperatures will climb back up to the mid-80s next week with more rain possible.",

    "text": "The IMD said in its alert that strong winds accompanying the duststorm may cause damage to plantation, horticulture, and standing crops. A duststorm accompanied by thunderstorms and rain, followed by gusty winds is sweeping across the entire Delhi-NCR region and its adjoining areas. The areas likely to be affected include Loni Dehat, Hindon Air Force Station, Ghaziabad, Indirapuram, Chhapraula, Noida, Dadri, Greater Noida, Gurugram, Faridabad, Manesar, Ballabhgarh, as well as Gohana, Gannaur, Sonipat, Rohtak, and Kharkhoda in Haryana, and Baraut, Bagpat, and Khekra in Uttar Pradesh, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Light intensity rain is forecasted for areas including Kaithal, Narwana, Rajaund, Assandh, Safidon, Barwala, Jind, Hissar, Hansi, Siwani, Meham, and Tosham in Haryana within the next two hours. The IMD said in its alert that strong winds accompanying the duststorm may cause damage to plantation, horticulture, and standing crops. Vulnerable structures are at risk of partial damage, while kutcha houses, walls, and huts may suffer minor damages. Loose objects are also likely to be propelled by the high winds, posing a hazard to outdoor spaces. In light of the impending weather conditions, residents have been urged to take necessary precautions. The Met department has advised them to stay indoors, close all windows and doors securely, and avoid unnecessary travel if possible. It has also cautioned against seeking refuge under trees, which may pose a greater risk during the storm.

    "text": "Significant severe weather continues across the South Tornadoes, damaging wind, large severe hail damage towns MELISSA ADAN (ABC) - More than 30 million Americans were threatened by severe weather across the southeast Thursday. Following several days of destructive storms across the central Plains and Midwest, deadly storms swept across the South. Nearly 100 tornadoes across 18 states have been reported or confirmed since Monday. The National Weather Service has confirmed this deadly tornado in Tennessee. It has been rated an EF-3 with winds up to 140mph. This storm devastated parts of the community. In Maury County, at least one person was killed and several others seriously hurt. Governor Bill Lee said “heartache from one side of the state to the other. We’re right here in Murray County, the hardest hit spot, as far as the tornado damage goes. Significant flooding all across the state”. West of Charlotte, North Carolina, one person was killed and another was hurt when a tree and live power lines fell on their SUV. Greg Beck witnessed the event and said “I heard somebody in there screaming and they were wanting help, and, I just, I just couldn’t get over to them. I wanted to, but I just couldn’t”. In Georgia, clean-up is underway after damaging winds and flooding devastated local communities before storms began to push toward Florida and the Gulf coast. While more severe weather is expected early Friday, storms are slowly winding down and exiting into the Gulf of Mexico. States hit hard by severe weather over the last few weeks are likely to be facing several months, potentially years, of rebuild in the aftermath. Copyright 2024 WHSV. All rights reserved.",

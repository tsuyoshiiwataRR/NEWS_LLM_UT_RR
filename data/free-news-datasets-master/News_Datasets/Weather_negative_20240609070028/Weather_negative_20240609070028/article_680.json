    "text": "Storms knock power out around the Gulf Coast MOBILE, Ala. ( [WALA](https://www.fox10tv.com/)) - A line of severe storms left many without power Friday morning. From Baldwin EMC - “We took a hard punch with the storms moving through this morning. Currently, we’re experiencing over 140 outages with more than 12,000 meters out. Transmission lines are down in the Bay Minette area. Our power supplier is working to get that restored. We have two other substations that took a hit and numerous scattered outages across the service territory due to trees on the lines and broken poles. Crews are out accessing the damage and restoring power. If you see downed powerlines do not approach and call 911 immediately. We ask for your patience as our crews work safely to restore power.” From Riviera Utilities - “Customers throughout our service area are experiencing interruptions in electric service due to high winds and fallen tree limbs as strong storms pass through Baldwin County. We are aware of these outages and crews have begun working to restore power in areas where it is safe for them to do so. We will update this post throughout the day as we have more information. If you are experiencing an interruption in service, please call our outage lines at 51-943-4999 for Foley or 251-625-4999 for Daphne. Our electric customers can simply text “OUT” to 251-943-4999 to report service interruptions as well. Stay safe!” Please [download the free FOX10 weather app](https://flowcode.com/p/iijgfWEf8?fc=0).

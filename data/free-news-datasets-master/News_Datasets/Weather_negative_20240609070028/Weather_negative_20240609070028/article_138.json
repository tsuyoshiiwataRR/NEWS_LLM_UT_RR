    "text": "Officials warn people about park flood waters BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WBKO) - Flooded areas have been reported in numerous locations after Wednesday night’s series of storms that passed through the region. One such area is Jim Roberts Community Park, located in Franklin. Drakes Creek runs through the park, which causes a substantial amount of flooding in the area. According to Lisa Deavers, Park Director of Jim Roberts Community Park, people have been trying to come out to the park to wade in the flood waters. ”We do encourage you not to do that,” Deavers said. “For one you don’t know the debris that’s underneath, but also we’ve had the electric electric plant board come out and turn off the electricity because there were electric panels in some of those areas. We know that we have some dead trees down there. Some are caught on guidelines. There’s no telling what kind of trash we’re going to find.” Deavers also encouraged anyone tempted to visit the park to see the flooding to be safe, stay out of the water, and not go into any areas of the park where the gates are closed.

    "text": "At 80 F, the low temperature in Baton Rouge on Thursday night broke an almost century-old record â€” but that doesn't mean a record-breaking summer of high heat like last year's is coming, a National Weather Service meteorologist said. Before Thursday, the record high minimum temperature for Baton Rouge was set in 1920 at 76 F, the weather service said. The low temperature was unusually high on Thursday because of a \"very warm and humid air mass from the Gulf\" over the area, Danielle Manning, NWS meteorologist, said. \"The air couldn't cool off as much as it usually does during the night,\" she said. The event wasn't necessarily a predictor for the coming summer months, though, Manning said. \"Individual days don't have a lot of bearing on a season,\" she said. Last summer had \"so much higher-than-normal temperatures,\" Manning said. \"It would be very unlikely to have another summer of that kind of heat.\" Baton Rouge experienced its [hottest year on record](https://www.nola.com/news/weather/new-orleans-2024-summer-heat-prediction/article_0a925dee-0d50-11ef-9aea-abaf2ac2d36d.html) in 2023, with a yearly average of 72.6 F, compared to a longstanding yearly average of 68.1, the National Weather Service said. A strong ridge of high pressure, also described as a heat dome, developed over Louisiana in June of 2023 and didn't start breaking up until October, the weather agency said. Times-Picayune reporter Kasey Bubnash contributed to this story.",

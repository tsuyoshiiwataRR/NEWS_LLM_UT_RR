    "text": "FIRST ALERT: Severe Weather Possible Overnight FIRST ALERT WEATHER EVENT: A complex of storms will move into Mississippi late tonight between 11pm and 3am. The hot and humid weather this afternoon has made the atmosphere very unstable, meaning there is a lot of Storm Fuel for storms to tap into. This set-up will mainly be a damaging wind event with Straight-Line Winds as high as 70-80 mph and quarter to golf ball size hail. A stray tornado or two can not be ruled out, but damaging winds remain my biggest concern. This event will be capable of producing WIDESPREAD Straight-Line Wind damage across the area which could down trees, damage buildings, airborne unsecured trampolines, and down power lines. Friday will start off cloudy, but we will see some sunshine by the afternoon. Highs will top out into the low to mid 80s. This weekend will be amazing! Skies will be sunny with much cooler weather as highs top out into the upper 70s to low 80s. Skies on Sunday will be partly cloudy with highs in the low 80s. Scattered thunderstorms will move in next Monday, with highs in the low 80s. Want more WDAM 7 news in your inbox? Click [here](https://www.wdam.com/newsletter/) to subscribe to our newsletter.

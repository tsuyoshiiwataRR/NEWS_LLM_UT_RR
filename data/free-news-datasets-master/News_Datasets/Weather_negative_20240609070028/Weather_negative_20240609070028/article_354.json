    "text": "From flooding to power outages and fallen trees, many western Kentucky residents are dealing with the impacts of recent storms. According to multiple emergency management directors in the western Kentucky area, the reported damage from this storm doesn't appear to be severe. Fulton County Emergency Management Director J. L. Atwill said the worst damage he'd seen was a front porch and part of a roof blown off. Though many are thankful the damage was not as bad as expected, there's still a lot of cleanup to do with fallen trees and branches. Steven Estes lives next door to Mount Moriah Primitive Baptist Church. He saw a fallen tree in the yard and was happy to help clean it up. He said that wasn't the only damage they'd had in the community though. \"I hear that there's quite a bit down â€” I'm in touch with the neighbors. I know there's a neighbor 'bout a mile that way that has a big tree down in their front yard,\" Estes said. Power lines are still down in some areas as well. Calvert City Marketing Director Blair Travis said she is thankful the damage wasn't worse. \"Luckily, I think we are, you know, doing really well. Yesterday, we had some power poles down and Jackson Purchase hopped right on it and has been working to get those repaired,\" Travis said. Weakley County, Tennessee, Emergency Management Director Ray Wiggington said they're working with damage as well. \"It looks like the city of Sharon took the majority of the damage for our county. I'm not seeing anything really serious. We've got right now probably about half a dozen homes affected,\" Wiggington said. Estes is just happy to help out those in his community. \"I like to serve. I think that serving people is serving God and so that's what I do. That's why I serve God, serve people,\" Estes said.",

    "text": "RUTHERFORD COUNTY, Tenn. (WZTV) — The National Weather Service is reporting a third tornado hit the Midstate during Wednesday's severe weather outbreak. Preliminary data from NWS shows an EF-0 tornado touched down in Eagleville near the intersection of Threet Rd and New Zion Rd.

According to NWS, the tornado continued east along Jones Rd snapping large limbs and uprooting more trees before it transitioned to straight line winds near the Gray Fox neighborhood. Rutherford County Government reports Eagleville and Christiana communities sustained major damage. While officials do not have exact numbers at this time, leaders say Rutherford County Emergency Management (RCEMA), Sheriff's deputies, Rutherford County Highway Department and the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) crews responded to several severe weather related calls throughout the county.

Most areas of the county received over six inches of rain. The West Fork Stones River went from 2.5 feet to almost 20 feet by 8 a.m. Thursday. \"Our Public Safety team is working around the clock to serve the community,\" said Mayor Joe Carr. \"I’m thankful to have such expertise in Rutherford County.” Rutherford County Government says Building Codes staff and RCEMA volunteers surveyed the damage to provide assessments to determine the event footprint. To assist in storm clean-up efforts, the Tennessee Department of Environmental and Conservation has certain open burn exceptions. Rutherford County Fire Marshal Joshua Sanders said the Fire Marshal’s office is available to answer any questions regarding the open burning of vegetative debris. Vegetative debris can be burned until May 15.

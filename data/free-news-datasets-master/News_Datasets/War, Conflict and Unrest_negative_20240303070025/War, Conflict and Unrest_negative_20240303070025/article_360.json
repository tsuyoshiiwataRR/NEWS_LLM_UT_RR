    "text": "Mali’s military-led authorities have ordered the removal of television channel France 2 from broadcasting packages for four months over a story on the security situation, according to official documents seen by AFP Thursday.\nThe move is the latest by the junta to shun former colonial power France after seizing power in a military coup.\nMali’s High Authority for Communication (HAC) criticised a report broadcast on France 2’s evening news in January for “glorifying terrorism” by contrasting “the firepower of armed terrorist groups” with that of the Malian army.\nThe communications authority accused France 2 of retroactively “justifying” the presence of the French anti-jihadist Barkhane force which operated in Mali until 2022.\n81% of working Nigerians don’t add value to the economy – Presidential Team Nigeria would have been worse without subsidy removal – FG French troops withdrew amid deteriorating relations between Bamako and Paris following military coups in 2020 and 2021.\nMali’s junta has since chosen to pivot towards Russia, both politically and militarily.\nIn a document sent to broadcasters, the HAC also cited “serious breaches” of journalistic ethics aimed at “demoralising the troops and the population”.\nIn 2022, Mali’s military leaders suspended the widely followed French networks France 24 and Radio France Internationale.\nCorrespondents from several foreign media were forced to leave, go into exile or suspend work.\nThe military also seized power in neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger in 2022 and 2023 respectively, with both introducing measures against the press.\nReporters Without Borders (RSF) said in a 2023 report that the Sahel region was in the process of becoming a “no-news zone”.",

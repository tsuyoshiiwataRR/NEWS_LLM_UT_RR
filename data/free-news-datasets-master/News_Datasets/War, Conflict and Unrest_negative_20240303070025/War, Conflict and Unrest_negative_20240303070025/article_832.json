    "text": "“This is truly an Everything Everywhere, All at Once scenario,” one official said. February 1, 2024 By PATRICK TUCKER China’s cyber activity is moving beyond the last decade’s spying and data theft toward direct attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure, the directors of the FBA, NSA, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, told lawmakers on Wednesday. The [Volt Typhoon](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/) hacking group is planting malware on network routers and other internet-connected devices that, if triggered, could disrupt water, power, and rail services, possibly causing widespread chaos or even injuring and killing Americans, they said. While Russia is known for cyber attacks that cause real-world harm—for example, targeting U.S. [political campaigns](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2017/02/did-russias-election-meddling-break-international-law-experts-cant-agree/135255/) and [Ukrainian power plants](https://www.csis.org/analysis/cyber-operations-during-russo-ukrainian-war#:~:text=Of%20the%2030%20recorded%20cyber,operations%20targeted%20government%20military%20targets.)—China is viewed as far more risk-averse. It’s best known for cyber theft, of [intellectual property](https://www.google.com/search?q=China+IP+theft+attacks+2023&rlz=1C5GCEM_en&oq=China+IP+theft+attacks+2023&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i402l6.5063j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) or government information, such as the Office of Personnel Management [ hack](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/inside-cyberattack-shocked-us-government/) uncovered in 2015. But Volt Typhoon, which Microsoft [revealed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/) last May, represents something far more threatening. At a meeting with reporters last week, a senior NSA official put the issue in starker terms. “They're in places that they are not there for intelligence purposes. They are not there for financial gain. Those are two hallmarks of Chinese intrusions in other sets and other lanes,” the official said.",

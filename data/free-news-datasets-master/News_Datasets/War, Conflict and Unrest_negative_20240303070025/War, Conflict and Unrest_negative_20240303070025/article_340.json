    "text": "Gunmen, on Thursday evening, invaded Koro town in Ekiti Local Government Area of Kwara State, killing the traditional ruler, Oba Segun Aremu-Cole.\nIt was gathered that the gunmen stormed the palace of the monarch around 7 pm, fired gunshots which hit the traditional ruler.\nThe wife of the monarch was also abducted by the assailants.\nKoro Ekiti shares boundary with Egbe, in Yagba West Local Government Area of Kogi State.\nThis is coming a few days after gunmen killed two traditional rulers in Ekiti State.\nThe duo – Onimojo of Imojo Ekiti in Oye Local Government Area and Elesun of Esun Ekiti in Ajoni, Ikole Local Government Area of Ekiti State, were attacked by the gunmen while returning from a meeting.\nMeanwhile, the state Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq who confirmed the attack late Thursday in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, condemned the killing of the monarch.\nThe statement read, “The monarch was reportedly shot dead in his palace on Thursday night by some unknown gunmen, who also whisked away his wife and two others.\n“The governor condemned the development, which he said was reckless, shocking, and abominable.\n“He charged the security agencies not to spare any resources to track down the perpetrators, free the spouse and others taken away, and bring them to book.”\nAjakaiye further quoted the governor as saying, “We will certainly get the perpetrators and ensure that this is their last crime against humanity.\n“My profound condolences go to the people of Koro. Our hearts are broken, and we stand by them at this time and always”, the statement said.\nHowever, the Kwara state Police Commissioner, Victor Olaiya, was yet to respond to inquiry on the incident as of the time of filing this report.",

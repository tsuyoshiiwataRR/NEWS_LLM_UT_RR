    "text": "New York Governor Kathy Hochul reiterated her comments that the immigrants responsible for the brutal attack on two police officers in Times Square should be deported.\n“Get them all and send them back,” Hochul told reporters during an unrelated news conference, the\nNew York Post.\n‘You don’t touch our police officers. You don’t touch anyone.\nHochul, who continued his U-turn on the border crisis at an event Wednesday, was asked whether immigrants and criminals like them should face deportation.\n“I think it’s actually something that should be looked at,” Hochul responded, despite previously touting the Empire State as a welcoming place for immigrants and backing the state’s controversial and sanctuary city laws.\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul has said deportation of the immigrants involved should be considered.\nJhoan Boada, 22, photographed joking with reporters, was arrested Monday night and charged with attempted assault on a police officer and gang assault.\n“I mean, if someone commits a crime against a police officer in New York state and they’re not here legally, it’s definitely worth investigating,” he said.\n“These are law enforcement officers who should never, under any circumstances, be subjected to physical assault,” Hochul added. “It’s wrong in every way and I hope the judges and prosecutors do the right thing.”\nPolice sources told\nhttps://nypost.com/2024/02/01/metro/police-believe-4-of-the-migrants-arrested-in-nyc-cop-beatdown-fled-to-california/ that four of the immigrants arrested in connection with the beating could have taken a bus to California.\nSources said authorities believe the group gave false names to a religious group that helps migrants leave the city and boarded a bus to California on Wednesday.\nYohenry Brito, 24, and Jandry Barros, 21, were arrested and charged with robbery and felony assault on Wednesday, according to the New York Police Department.\nThe brutal attack occurred on Saturday around 8:30 pm in Times Square when officers attempted to disperse a disorderly group in front of 220 West 42 Street.\nA fight broke out between a suspect in a yellow sweatshirt and police officers.\nAccording to the NYPD, the immigrants began attacking the officers, kicking them in the head and body while the two officers attempted to restrain one of the other men, ripping off his sweatshirt.\nThe migrants then fled, leaving unidentified police officers on the ground as they fled east on 42nd Street toward Seventh Avenue.\nThat night, four of them: Darwin Andrés Gómez Izquiel, 19, Kelvin Servat Arocha, 19, Juárez Wilson, 21, and Yorman Reverón, 24, were arrested.\nAll were charged with assault on a police officer, gang assault, obstruction of government administration and disorderly conduct.\nJhoan Boada, 22, was arrested Monday night and charged with attempted assault on a police officer and gang assault.\nYohenry Brito, 24, and Jandry Barros, 21, were arrested and charged with robbery and felony assault on Wednesday for the attack on police in Times Square.\nOn Wednesday night, Boada was also released without bail because he has no criminal record.\nPolice sources confirmed the immigration status of the men\nthe new york post. Several of the men’s addresses provided by police are homeless and migrant shelters.\nThree of the men, Izquiel, Arocha and Wilson, were released on personal recognizance, meaning they were released without bail while their case is pending.\nReverón was granted supervised release without bail. He already has two open cases for assault and robbery in Manhattan, after robbing and assaulting a Nordstrom Rack employee in November.\nHe also allegedly punched a loss prevention officer at the famous Herald Square Macy’s while trying to commit a robbery with two other suspects.\nOn Wednesday night, Boada was also released without bail because he has no criminal record.\nAs he left the courthouse, the 22-year-old raised his middle finger to reporters.\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams has repeatedly pointed to the justice system’s current practice of “catch, release, repeat” as the primary driver of crime in New York City.\nOver the summer, Adams blamed the city’s criminal justice system for turning the Big Apple into the “laughing stock of our entire country.”\nNew York City, in particular, has struggled under the weight of tens of thousands of migrants arriving at its borders in search of places to stay and other accommodations.\nIn 2023 alone, the city faced the arrival of more than 100,000 immigrants.\nHochul once welcomed asylum seekers with “open arms” and pledged to house them, but is now beginning to invite migrants to “go elsewhere” because the city is at its limit.\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams has repeatedly pointed to the justice system’s current practice of “catch, release, repeat” as the primary driver of crime in New York City.\nThe Democrat addressed the immigration crisis in September, warning that asylum seekers arriving in New York City will not be housed in hotel rooms as they have been in the past.\n“We have to get the word out that when you come to New York, you won’t have any more hotel rooms, we don’t have capacity,” Hochul said on CNN. “So we also have to properly communicate that we are at a limit: if you are going to leave your country, go somewhere else.”\nIt is a striking change from his statements in December 2021, when he promised to house and protect asylum seekers, before thousands of migrants began arriving each month from southern border states. More than 113,000 immigrants have arrived in the city since last spring.\n‘As you know, the Statue of Liberty is inscribed. It says, “Give me your tired, poor, huddled masses, who long to be free,” Hochul said earlier. “You are welcome with open arms and we will work to keep you safe… We will not only house you, but we will also protect you.”",

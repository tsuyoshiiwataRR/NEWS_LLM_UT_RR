    "text": "Around this time last year, I wrote an article about\nthe student-led effort of Resist US-Led War Seattle to cut UW’s ties with Boeing. The company’s long-standing influence on UW and enablement of the military pursuits of our government has driven this organization into action.\nResist is a national organization seeking to dismantle imperialism and militarism led by the United States. In Seattle, the local chapter’s work primarily focuses on political education and mobilization of those in the Seattle area — especially college students.\nThe organization shifted gears Oct. 7, when Hamas militants attacked an Israeli city. It provided an opportunity to alert locals on the impact of UW’s partnership with Boeing in the Israeli occupation of Palestine.\nBoeing is a major supplier to the Department of Defense, and the U.S. government is a major supplier of arms to Israel.\nJust last year, Boeing signed a\n$927 million deal with Israel to supply the military with four KC-46A aerial refuelers. Quickly after the initial retaliations against Hamas, Boeing delivered over 1,000 bombs to the Israeli military in their airstrikes in the Gaza Strip.\n“You can’t separate UW from Boeing,” Zho Ragen, a Ph.D. student and member of Resist US-Led War Seattle, said.\nBoeing has been a significant investor in UW since 1917. Along with funding research facilities on campus, the local company recruits a large number of engineering students. As of 2022, roughly 1,200 UW alumni were hired by Boeing in the last five years, and 6,500 alumni are currently working for the company.\nBut do these present and future employees fully grasp the scope of Boeing’s involvement in the upkeep of war?\nNikhil, a UW employee, expressed that he believes students have been misled by mass media institutions and the public education system.\n“More and more, students are experiencing exploitation,” Nikhil said. “They are learning how to dismantle a system that doesn’t serve peoples’ needs.”\nResist Seattle has contributed to this through both their protests and teach-ins.\nAt UW, Resist has led several protests and walk-outs on and around campus, one of them being at the Boeing Military Delivery Center in November of 2023. Along with this action, they prioritize teach-ins, seeking political education. Most recently,\n“From Palestine to Hawai’i: Resist the U.S. War Machine” on Jan. 24 and 25 informed students on issues regarding current U.S. military strategy.\nThese teach-ins seek to explain many of the complex factors of the U.S. power: the role of educational institutions, the current foreign strategy of the Biden administration, and the basis of imperialism.\n“We have power when we’re united and exposing the system,” Nikhil said.\nHistorically, major protests that have led to a change in policy were the result of various marginalized groups acting in solidarity. In the ‘60s and ‘70s, for example, the mass protests incited by anti-war student organizations imposed pressure on the Nixon administration to eventually end the Vietnam War.\nThey’ve collaborated with student organizations like Students United for Palestinian Equality & Return (SUPER) UW, the Black Student Union (BSU), and Anakbayan UW, among many others. More recently, there is a coalition of student organizations called UW United Front working to get UW to cut ties with Boeing and Israel.\n“This is becoming a very strong and bolstering cause for grassroots organizations,” Ragen said. “It’s helping people raise their political consciousness and recognize all of these problems are very interconnected.”\nWhy should college students care about these complex ideas and global events?\n“You don’t need to know much to know this isn’t okay,” Ragen said.\nSimply taking in what is going on every day can say a lot about the situation. Understanding the history is one thing, but seeing how our tuition, taxes, government, and our school is actively contributing to the occupation is alarming in and of itself.\n“The university is facilitating the needs of corporations and fascist governments and U.S. imperialism instead of the needs of students,” Nikhil said.\nOnce people grasp that our struggles as Americans and as students at UW are connected to the external offenses of our own government, the conflicts overseas become much more straightforward. The global economic interests of the U.S. have and will continue to upstage the domestic concerns of its citizens.\n“We want to meet the calls and needs of students for livelihood and international solidarity with peoples’ struggles against imperialism,” Nikhil said.\nRagen explained that the result of this system will always be war and militarism. Consequently, people will resist, and the U.S. will utilize its force to maintain the system — which is what we’re seeing in Gaza now.\nThere’s a lot of history at play in Gaza, much of which the West had a massive role in forming.\nWhat we’re seeing now is a reflection of this occupation, as Palestinians living under the control of the Israeli government are being killed and displaced to make way for Israeli settlers.\nThe U.S. didn’t always support Israel, but the late 1960s changed that, as fears of alliances between Arab nations and the Soviet Union rose. Now, we can see the unwavering military support of Israel under the Biden administration.\nNow, with the death toll in Gaza reaching over 26,000 people – an unprecedented amount in the 75-year conflict — organizations like Resist and other student groups are exposing the imperial roots of corporations and the U.S. government’s involvement in the perpetuation of violence against Palestinians.\nThe deep connections among these institutions are intimidating, but it also means they rely on each other to maintain the system. By bringing attention to UW’s partnership with Boeing and demanding divestment, students can weaken Boeing’s influence domestically and globally.\nReach writer Sophie Knight at X: @knightsophie13\nLike what you’re reading?

    "text": "KYIV, Ukraine: Ukraine´s spy chief on Thursday said Kyiv´s forces were planning to step up their attacks on Russian infrastructure sites, following a spate of drone strikes on Russian energy facilities this year. “The number of attacks on Russian infrastructure is likely to increase,” Kyrylo Budanov, chief of Ukraine´s GUR military intelligence unit, said in a social media post. “Hypothetically, there is a plan according to which all this is happening. I think that this plan may include all major critical and military infrastructure in Russia,” he added in a cautiously-worded statement. For months Ukraine did not comment publicly on drone strikes and other attacks on Russian territory that it was believed to be involved in. But in recent months its military agencies have begun to claim public responsibility for a series of drone attacks hundreds of kilometres behind the front lines. It calls the strikes on Russian oil and gas facilities “fair” retribution for Russia´s wave of attacks against its own energy infrastructure.",

The sanctions will ban dozens of settlers and their families from traveling to or conducting business in the U.S.Biden’s order applies to settlers who make \"acts or threats of violence against civilians, intimidate civilians to cause them to leave their homes, destroy or seize property, or engage in terrorist activity in the West Bank.\"The action came after 17-year-old Abedel Jabbar, a U.S. citizen, was allegedly shot and killed by an Israeli settler while visiting the West Bank in January.

He also tried to break windows of vehicles passing by with activists inside, the State Department noted, adding that Zicherman cornered at least two activists and injured them both.Levi is accused of leading a group of settlers who created fear in the West Bank. The State Department also said Levi led settlers from the Meitarim Farm outpost, who assaulted Palestinian and Bedouin civilians, threatened them with additional violence if they did not leave their homes, set fire to their fields and destroyed their property.

Therefore, no room for exceptional measures in this regard.\"Netanyahu's finance minister, Benjamin Smotrich, called the accusations of violence by settlers an \"antisemitic lie,\" and added that settlements in the region will continue.\"If the price is the imposition of American sanctions on me — so be it,\" Smotrich said.

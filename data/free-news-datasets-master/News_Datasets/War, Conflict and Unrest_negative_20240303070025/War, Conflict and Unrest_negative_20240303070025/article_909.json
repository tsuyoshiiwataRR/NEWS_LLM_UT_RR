    "text": "Tension was at its height this Thursday afternoon near the Turkish factory of the American group Procter & Gamble (P&G), located on the outskirts of Istanbul.\nAn armed man claiming to act “for Gaza” held several employees hostage this Thursday evening.\nThe hostage taking occurred in the middle of the afternoon, around 3 p.m. local time (12 p.m. GMT), according to Turkish media, in this factory of the American manufacturer of household and hygiene products.\nThe man, who retains seven employees according to the Umut-Sen union, justified his action by ongoing Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip, local police said.\nSpecial forces entered into negotiations with him, according to local media.\nA Procter & Gamble spokesperson confirmed that its factory in Gebze, on the eastern outskirts of Istanbul, was \"evacuated earlier today.\"\n“We are working with local authorities to resolve an urgent security situation,” he said.\n“Workers were evacuated from the factory;\nseven workers remain hostages.\nThe boss is responsible for their safety,” said the Umut-Sen union in a message posted on the social network X.\n“For Gaza” painted in red on a wall\nA police cordon prevented access to the surroundings of the factory this Thursday evening, where some 500 people are usually employed, AFP journalists noted.\nAnd a riot police bus arrived near the factory.\nImages reported by Turkish media, which could not be authenticated, showed a man with his face partially covered by a Palestinian keffiyeh, wearing what could be an explosive belt around his waist and a pistol in his right hand.\n“For Gaza,” says a message painted in red on a wall behind him, under two Turkish and Palestinian flags facing each other.\nAlso read “Our caregivers fear for their lives”: in Gaza, these mobile teams still on the ground\nThe husband of one of the detained employees told the private news agency DHA that the man had threatened to “shoot in all directions” in the event of police intervention.\n“If he does this for Palestine, let him go and fight there.\nWhat does my 26 year old daughter have to do with this?\n», Reacted Çigdem Aydemir, the mother of one of the detained employees, among anxious relatives waiting in the night.\n“We have no information from the inside.\nWe have been waiting for six hours but no one in charge has made a statement,” lamented the father of another hostage, refusing to give his identity.\nA boycott of American products in Türkiye\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, one of Israel's most critical leaders since the start of the war between the Jewish state and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, has repeatedly denounced US support for Israel, which he described as a “terrorist” and “genocidal” state.\nCalls to boycott American products have also been widely reported in Turkey since the start of the conflict.\nSeveral McDonald's restaurants and Starbucks cafes - which operate under Turkish license - were vandalized across the country.\nVIDEO.\nIsrael-Hamas war: Starbucks, target of pro-Palestinian demonstrators in Türkiye\nAt the beginning of November, Turkish police had to disperse using tear gas a pro-Palestinian rally organized in front of a military base housing American forces, a few hours before a visit to Ankara by Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\nCrowds of protesters also gathered in the early days of the conflict in front of the US embassy in Ankara and its consulate in Istanbul.\nDemonstrations in support of the Palestinians are regularly organized in the country.",

    "text": "Philip Lenczycki\nDaily Caller News Foundation\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nThe Republican National Committee (RNC) adopted a resolution condemning the Biden administration’s immigration policies Thursday, citing the national security threat posed by “Chinese military-aged men” entering the country illegally, the Daily Caller News Foundation has learned.\nThe new RNC resolution states that the Biden administration “deliberately” invited in a “massive and systematic illegal alien invasion of the U.S.,” which, among other things, has exposed the nation to an “exceedingly high” sabotage risk “with the rise of Chinese immigrant encounters.” Co-sponsored by 48 RNC members from 23 states, the resolution calls for enabling state and local law enforcement to arrest and detain certain illegal immigrants until U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) assumes custody.\nTRENDING:\nNo woke!

Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\nThe Biden administration drastically simplified the vetting process for Chinese illegal immigrants in April 2023, the DCNF previously\nreported after obtaining an internal U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) email. The new CBP guidance radically reduced the number of interview questions for Chinese illegal immigrants from roughly 40 to just five.\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nBorder Patrol agents have encountered approximately 35,000 Chinese illegal immigrants at the border since 2022,\naccording to CBP data.\n“President Biden’s border crisis has exposed the U.S. to ‘exceedingly high’ sabotage risk with the rise of Chinese alien encounters,” the resolution states, quoting author Gordon Chang. “Some of the Chinese illegal aliens have been instructed in Chinese how to fake their political asylum evidence after they entered the U.S.”\nThe RNC resolution also criticizes the Biden administration for ending former President Donald Trump’s so-called “\nremain in Mexico” policy, which required illegal immigrants to wait in Mexico while their immigration cases moved through U.S. courts. The resolution also faults Biden for reinstating the so-called “catch and release” policy, which refers to a 2021 Department of Homeland Security memorandum authorizing immigration officials who encounter illegal immigrants to utilize “alternatives to detention,” such as “electronic monitoring via a GPS-enabled ankle bracelet.”\nConsequently, the new RNC resolution supports\nH.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act of 2023, on the grounds that it will “stop this invasion of the U.S. by finishing the wall, ending the ‘catch and release’ program, ending the abuse of parole authority, ending the manipulation of the asylum system and reinstating ‘remain in Mexico’ policy, which protects American jobs and taxpayers by barring asylum seekers from living and working in the U.S. until their claims are approved.”\n“The Republican National Committee supports immediate deportation of illegal immigrant asylum applicants ordered removed upon failure to appear at their court hearings,” the new RNC resolution states. “A lawless border facilitates unspeakable human suffering through criminal cartel sponsored human trafficking leading to slavery and sexual abuse, including abuse of children.”\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nSolomon Yue, who has served as an Oregon RNC committeeman since 2000, was the chief sponsor of the new RNC resolution.\nBorn in China, Yue came to the U.S. in 1980 to study at Alaska Pacific University and became a naturalized American citizen in 1992, he told the DCNF.\n“As a legal immigrant from Communist China, I am concerned about Biden’s eight million illegal alien invasion of America,” Yue said. “I don’t want to see this republic become the country I have escaped. When that happens, we’ll have no place to go.”\nYue told the DCNF that he believes that the spike in “Chinese military-aged men” illegally entering the U.S. is “a national security threat.”\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n“The CCP is exploiting the current illegal alien invasion of the U.S. by sending their fifth columnists as fake asylum seekers,” Yue said.\nThis story originally was published by\nthe Daily Caller News Foundation.\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

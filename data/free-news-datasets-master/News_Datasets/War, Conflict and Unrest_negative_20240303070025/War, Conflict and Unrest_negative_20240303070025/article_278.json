(Photo by Ali Hashisho/Xinhua)\nBEIRUT, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's parliament speaker Nabih Berri on Thursday slammed Israel for targeting civilians and residential neighborhoods in Lebanon's southern villages and towns, the National News Agency (NNA) reported.\n\"Israel's targeting of civilians is a violation of UN Resolution 1701 and the rules of engagement,\" said Berri during his meeting in Beirut with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron.\nBerri said that Lebanon has adhered to Resolution 1701, which was adopted in August 2006 to seek a complete cessation of hostilities shortly after a deadly war between Israel and Hezbollah ended with a fragile truce.\nCameron arrived on Thursday in Lebanon to explore solutions that prevent military escalation in southern Lebanon, and discuss the situation in Gaza as well as British-Lebanese ties.\nDuring the meeting, Mikati said Lebanon supports a peaceful solution in the region, adding that Britain's support is essential in pushing in this direction.\nFor his part, Cameron emphasized the priority of a ceasefire in Gaza in preparation for moving to the following stages to resolve the conflict.\nConfrontations continued on Thursday on the Lebanese-Israeli borders, injuring a civilian in al-Wazzani village, who was later transported by the Lebanese Red Cross to Marjeyoun Governmental Hospital, according to the NNA.\nMeanwhile, Hezbollah armed group announced that its fighters attacked the Israeli al-Radar and al-Samaqa sites in occupied Lebanese Shebaa Farms, confirming inflicting casualties among Israeli soldiers.\nThe Lebanon-Israel border witnessed increased tension since Oct. 8 after Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets toward Israel in support of the Hamas attacks on Israel the previous day, prompting Israel to respond by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon.\nThe confrontations between Hezbollah and Israel have killed 240 on the Lebanese side, including 173 Hezbollah members and 39 civilians, according to Lebanese security sources. â– \nThe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) vehicles are on patrol on the Lebanese-Israeli border in Marjayoun, Lebanon, on Feb. 2, 2024.

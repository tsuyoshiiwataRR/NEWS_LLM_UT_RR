    "text": "Court Nullifies PDP's Candidacy in Ebonyi South Bye-Election: Onu Alleges Political Motivation\nHuman Rights Alarm Over Military Deployment for Election Security in El Salvador\nEl Salvador, a nation with a history of armed conflict, teeters on the brink of a contentious electoral process. Human rights organizations have raised alarm bells over the deployment of military personnel for security tasks during the elections set for February 4 and the upcoming municipal elections in March. By law, only the National Civil Police (PNC), with 22 thousand members active on voting day, should be tasked with security duties. Yet, military forces have been spotted in various locations in the capital, including near Cuscatlán Park, around Rosales Hospital, and in parts of the historic center.\nMilitary Involvement in Public Security: A Cause for Concern\nGabriela Santos, director of the Human Rights Institute of the UCA (Idhuca), has expressed disquiet about the military’s involvement in public security. She fears that this action could cultivate an environment of fear, intimidation, and potential repression. Santos pointed to past instances of sexual abuse against girls and excessive use of force by the military during the emergency regime, indicating the possible dangers of such a deployment.\nControversy Surrounding Bukele’s Presidency\nThe presidency of Nayib Bukele has been riddled with allegations of human rights abuses and power concentration. Human rights groups and advocates have voiced concerns about the authoritarian tactics employed by Bukele’s administration, which include mass detentions and the suspension of rights. Despite a decrease in the homicide rate, the long-term democratic risks associated with Bukele’s increasing control over every branch of El Salvador’s government raise serious concerns.\nDemocracy at Risk?\nWhile improved security is a positive development, the potential erosion of democratic processes and the normalization of militarized public security is worrisome. The presence of the military during an electoral process sends a strong signal about the state of democracy in El Salvador. As the country heads towards the upcoming elections, the world watches with bated breath, hoping that the rights and freedoms of the Salvadoran people are upheld, and their democratic processes remain untarnished.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/politics/unveiling-australias-political-donation-landscape-in-2023-top-donors-and-the-quest-for-transparency/",

    "text": "Netanyahu to heads of authorities from the surrounding area: determined to restore the kibbutzim\n\"They did it a little too late,\" stated Tamir Peretz of Sderot who heard about the Home Front Command's decision to ease the restrictions on the settlements surrounding Gaza and allow classes to be held.\nAccording to him, \"it was possible to do this before, already a month and a half ago it was possible to return to emergency routine. This is good for the residents and good for the city of Sderot, that way it will be possible to move it.\"\nThe Home Front Command's announcement, about changing the defense policy in the surrounding settlements, caught some of the residents off guard.\nSome of them have already returned to their homes, some are in transit and the rest are still waiting to see where the war will go.\n\"It seems a little strange to me that the Home Front Command issues announcements by surprise without preparing the authorities,\" said Moran Hajabi, a resident of Yachini, after receiving the news.\n\"They are creating confusion among the residents, the authorities are trying to prepare the infrastructure in front of the residents, and the Home Front Command comes and flashes a message that conveys instability.\"\nA destroyed house in Kibbutz Bari, January 1, 2023/Uri Sela\nThe security establishment understands that despite the changes in the defense policy, opening the education system in the surrounding settlements, in the shadow of the continuation of the fighting, is a challenge.\nArmy officials claimed that the changes were made in coordination with the authorities: \"There are settlements that have already returned, and some of the solutions were given within the kibbutzim. There are additional kibbutzim that want to return.\"\nBeyond the question of security, the residents of the enclave also face the psychological impact of living in a combat zone.\nThe army emphasized: \"We said that from a security point of view it is possible to return, the decision is ultimately up to the individual, the family and the community. Just as there are families who do not want to return for the sake of the mental security of the children, there are many families who want to return. Last Friday, Or Haner voted in the kibbutz and decided that the kibbutz is returning The communities that decided to return must open the schools.\"\nKibbutz Nahal Oz destroyed after the terrorist attack by Hamas.\nOctober 20, 2023./Flash 90, Jonathan Zindel\ndo not miss\nBiden signed an unprecedented presidential order against settlers who attack Palestinians\nBen Gvir has introduced a spirit into the police force - and it is evil and dangerous\nReport: A gunman is holding hostages in a factory in Turkey - in protest of the war in Gaza\nUncompromising sex life - \"It saved my sex and relationship\"\nTherefore, it seems that the residents of the Otaf are still studying the decision made by the Home Front Command and the Southern Command and the feelings are mixed.\n\"If the state is able to allow to return and not by force - then excellent,\" said Yaron Samimi of Shukda.\n\"People need to be given the time and the options. It is impossible to return residents without educational institutions. And those who are not yet ready to return should be given the option.\"\nOn the other hand, there are also those who think that the return to the surrounding settlements is still premature.\n\"I'm in favor of giving the residents the option to return, but they also need to be synchronized,\" said one of the heads of the authorities in Otef who chose to remain anonymous.\n\"There are several plans of the army, of Takuma and more, but not all the state bodies are synchronized. The state must allow those who started the school year outside the envelope to finish. There are still noises of war here. We could wait until we understand where the war is going.\"\nMore on the same topic:\nGaza Envelope\nGaza war\nWar of Iron Swords",

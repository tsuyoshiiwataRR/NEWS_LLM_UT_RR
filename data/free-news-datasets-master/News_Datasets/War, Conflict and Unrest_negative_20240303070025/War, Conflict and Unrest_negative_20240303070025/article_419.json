The House vote was 422-2. Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Cori Bush (D-MO) voted no. Another Democrat, Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-IL), voted 'present.' The bill was HR 6679, titled \"No Immigration Benefits for Hamas Terrorists Act.\" Tlaib issued a statement after the vote in which she called the bill unnecessary and redundant.Karen Armstrong explains that Tlaib is lying -- shocked faces all around, I know -- when she claims this bill is \"redundant.\" It's not redundant, as it expands the bar on Hamas terrorists to PLO terrorists who took part in the slaughter. She's not against the \"redundancy.\" She objects to her fellow Hamas terrorists being treated as criminals, when they're really Heroes. Two hijab-wearing activists for the \"Liberation of Palestine\" were denied entry to a Harris event.[Washington Examiner:] \"It's just another GOP messaging bill being used to incite anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian, and anti-Muslim hatred that makes communities like ours unsafe,\" said the Michigan Democrat, who is the only Palestinian American in Congress. \"I made a promise to my residents when they sent me to Congress that I would take meaningful actions to end hateful Trump-era immigration policies, reunite families, welcome migrants and asylum seekers, and reform our immigration system,\" Tlaib added. \"I reaffirm that commitment today, and will always speak truth to power in the face of disgusting attempts by my colleagues to dehumanize our immigrant neighbors.\"Tlaib has a history of antisemitism so her vote against the bill isn't much of a surprise. However, accusing Republicans of anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian, and anti-Muslim hatred is beyond the pale. The bill passed with the support of the entire House, including the Democrat caucus. It had the full support of House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jerry Nadler (D-NY). Tlaib and another anti-semitic Democrat, Cori Bush, were the only two House members who voted against it. Rep. Ramirez wimped out and voted present, for whatever reason she had. It is rare for such overwhelming bipartisan support for a bill in the House. Tlaib and Bush are the ones who are out of step.\nThey immediately began accusing Kamala Harris of (wait for it...)\n. The clip features a couple of pro-Palestinian activists from the group Nevadans for Palestinian Liberation who had RSVPd for a Kamala Harris event over the weekend only to be told at the door that they had been disinvited. As you'll see, the activists immediately jumped to the conclusion that they were being disinvited because they were both wearing hijabs. The person who is manning the door apologizes but doesn't offer any other explanation.\nOne of the hijab-wearing women issued a statement because of course she did. Why does everyone get to Issue Statements except me? I need to start Issuing Statements. I'll try to Issue Statements two or three times per week.\nAt an event championing women's rights, I was targeted by the Biden-Harris team because I am a jijabi woman. I have never disrupted a politcal event in my life and any insinuation of me doing is is categorically inaccurate. I voted for Biden and Harris in 2020 because I thought they stood with the Muslim community against hate. The violence of the Muslim ban is not just through Trump's administration. Biden and Harris implemented a domestic Muslim ban that day by not allowing hijabis into their events. With what happened, I know I will not be voting for Democrats this November.\"I don't believe you. I hate defending Biden and Harris, but the Palestinian terrorists force me to do so. I think the Harris people were probably think the Palestinian activists planned to disrupt the event... like they always do:\nThe protests are working. It's clear that Joe Biden is rattled. He's going to Michigan today, and among the items his campaign desired to put on the itinerary was to be a meeting with Dearborn, Michigan Mayor Abdullah Hammoud. He refused to meet with the President. He snubbed Biden because of his support of Israel against the terrorists. In the House of Representatives Wednesday, Republicans forced the Democrats to cast another walk the plank vote. This time, it was a resolution on whether members of Hamas, the ones who committed the rapes, the killings, the beheadings, the burning alive of infants, the kidnappings, whether they should be allowed into the United States. The vote was 422-2-1. Cori Bush of Missouri and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan cast the two lone votes to allow Hamas terrorists into the U.S., because to them, Hamas aren't terrorists. They're freedom fighters, and freedom fighters are supposed to be celebrated, especially when they're killing their Jewish oppressors. Delia Ramirez of Illinois was in the chamber, but couldn't take a firm position on what should be the potential immigration status of terrorists, and voted present instead. Courage.Much more at the link, which is a detailed recap of the Palestinian pressure on the Biden Administration, and the Biden Administration's moves towards capitulation.\nWashington is weighing using weapons supplies as leverage to pressure Israel to reduce the intensity of its operations in the Gaza Strip, according to a Sunday report by US television network NBC. Although no decisions have been made, the White House asked the Defense Department to review which weapons could be used as leverage on Israel, the report said, pointing at 155 mm artillery shells and JDAM kits to turn missiles into precision munitions. The report cited three current US officials and a former official.The Intrepid AoS Liaison to the Democrat Underground reported on the brewing fight over terrorism in the Democrat Party:\nPosted by: Disinformation Expert Ace at\nComments\nPosted by:\nPosted by: BignJames at February 01, 2024 01:08 PM (AwYPR)\nChristo-fascist?

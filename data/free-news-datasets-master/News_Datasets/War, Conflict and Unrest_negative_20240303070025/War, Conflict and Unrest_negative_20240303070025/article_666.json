    "text": "Frank Wilson Sentenced to 40 Years for Second-Degree Murder of Partner Sonja Burch\n‘Take Our Border Back’ Convoy Rallies in Dripping Springs, Calling for Stronger Border Security\nIn a display of united dissent, the ‘Take Our Border Back’ convoy arrived at Dripping Springs, Texas, on Wednesday evening, despite a three-hour delay. The convoy, a collective of trucks and private vehicles, was met with a small crowd of supporters, underscoring the local resonance of their cause. This demonstration, aimed at expressing concerns about border security and its implications on local communities, is part of a wider peaceful First Amendment gathering.\nFrom Vigil to Rally\nThe convoy’s arrival in Dripping Springs sets the stage for a scheduled pep rally on Thursday at the One Shot Distillery & Brewery. This gathering seeks to pool insights from experts and individuals with firsthand experience of border issues, thereby fostering a broader understanding of the situation. One such supporter, Michael R. from Athens, Texas, emphasized the significance of the rally and the overarching need for bolstered border security. His hopes for peaceful demonstrations throughout the convoy’s nationwide tour echo the sentiment of many involved.\nOn the Road to Eagle Pass\nPost pep-rally, the convoy is slated to depart from Dripping Springs on Friday, making its way to Eagle Pass. This chosen route is not arbitrary, but rather a deliberate attempt to demonstrate solidarity with state leaders advocating for stronger border security measures. Eagle Pass has become a focal point in recent times, given its status as a hotspot for migrants crossing the border into Texas.\nA Nationwide Call to Action\nThe ‘Take Our Border Back’ convoy, which has already journeyed through nine states over two and a half days, is more than a protest—it’s a nationwide call to action. The participants, who have collectively raised $157,000 in donations, argue that the Biden administration needs to take more decisive actions to address border security issues. Despite facing internal friction and instances of sabotage, the convoy has managed to keep its wheels turning, gathering momentum as it passes through different states.\nAs the migrant crisis at the southern border continues to dominate national discourse, the ‘Take Our Border Back’ convoy serves as a reminder of the pressing need for a more secure border. Whether the Biden administration will answer this call-to-action remains to be seen.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/world/chitungwiza-municipality-launches-verification-process-for-land-stand-offer-letters-amid-fraud-concerns/",

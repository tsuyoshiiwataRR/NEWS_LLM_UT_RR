    "text": "A disappointing defeat to PAOK last week has put lots of pressure on Panathinaikos to overcome their eternal enemy, Olympiacos, as they prepare for an intense meeting this weekend that could drastically impact the title race.\nThe “Trifylli” hosts the Piraeus giants at “Leoforos” Stadium on Monday morning (AEDT) in the Greek Super League’s 21st round and there is plenty on the line for both teams to strive for maximum points.\nFor the Greens, this game looms as a crucial contest they must win in order to not fall any further behind the current league leaders, PAOK.\nMeanwhile, the “red-whites” are also seeking to keep their title hopes alive while also getting revenge for losing to their archenemy in the Greek Cup earlier this month.\nPAOK will be praying that the “Trifylli” drops points, though they will first be concerned about winning their own away contest with Atromitos, a team that is still battling for a shot at sixth position.\nAEK battles sixth-placed Asteras Tripolis at “Agia Sophia” Stadium as they look to maintain their position as PAOK’s nearest challengers, and possibly gain ground on them if the Thessaloniki club somehow fails to defeat the Peristeriotes.\nLamia travels to face a relegation-threatened Giannina side and the Fthiotida outfit have no room for sympathy as they fight for sixth position, currently sitting two points behind Asteras Tripolis.\nKifisia is hoping to snap their six-game winless streak in the league and climb out of last place when they challenge OFI away.\nVolos and Panetolikos are both seeking victories to end their respective winless runs on Sunday morning, with the hosting Magnesia side having gone six league outings without maximum points in comparison to their opponents who have lost four in a row.\nThe match looms as an important moment in each of their efforts to avoid relegation.\nPanserraikos is awaiting a visit from Aris as they bid to down the “yellow-blacks” and extend their unbeaten record to five matches.\nFor Aris, each match against lower-ranked opposition at this point is a must-win or else they risk putting their play-offs spot in danger.\nGreek Super League Rd 21 fixtures (AEDT)\nVolos-Panetolikos: 02.30, Sun 04 Feb\nPanserraikos-Aris: 04.30, Sun 04 Feb\nOFI-Kifisia: 01.00, Mon 05 Feb\nAEK-Asteras Tripolis: 02.30, Mon 05 Feb\nGiannina-Lamia: 02.30, Mon 05 Feb\nAtromitos-PAOK: 05.30, Mon 05 Feb\nPanathinaikos-Olympiacos: 06.00, Mon 05 Feb",

    "text": "Good evening. Here is the Thursday, February 1 edition of [Today in Slovakia](https://spectator.sme.sk/t/8292/today-in-slovakia) - the main news of the day in less than five minutes. Minister wants Patriots for discounted price During the [Question Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEqQuV-w5U8), which is an hour-long Thursday slot in parliament when the government answers MPs’ questions, Defence Minister Robert Kaliňák confirmed that he would like to convince the US to agree to the sale of its Patriot long-range air defence system to Slovakia for a discounted price. The USA offered Slovakia a discount on the purchase of Viper helicopters. Kaliňák added that no enemy should be allowed to take over Slovakia’s airspace. To protect it, he noted, Slovakia needs air defence systems in addition to fighter jets. The ministry is assessing offers from Germany and South Korea. The previous government began negotiations with Israel and Poland. Kaliňák said that it would be good to own six medium-range batteries, but also two or three long-range batteries, such as the Patriot or IRIS-T system. For me, he said, air defence is a priority. Kaliňák noted that he tries to convince PM Robert Fico to share this view, too. Slovakia sent its [S-300](https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22881481/slovakia-has-sent-an-s-300-air-defence-system-to-ukraine-heres-what-it-means.html), a long-range Soviet air defence system, to Ukraine shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Afterwards, the country was protected by Patriot systems provided by its allies. In 2023, it was replaced with [SAMP/T](https://www.mosr.sk/52615-sk/protivzdusnu-obranu-slovenska-posilni-taliansky-system-protivzdusnej-obrany-sampt/) Mamba from Italy, which continues to protect Slovakia’s airspace.

The French artist, famous for his spectacular concerts, which combine music with laser displays and projections, will be one of the headliners at the Starmus festival, a major international event that combines science, art and music. The Slovak Spectator [spoke](https://spectator.sme.sk/c/23276028/technology-is-neutral-we-should-not-be-afraid-of-it-says-jean-michel-jarre.html) with the artist ahead of the festival. It will take place in Bratislava this spring. FREE EVENTS IN BRATISLAVA Easy Sunday hike This Sunday the group of foreigners will meet at the Patrónka bus to set out on their [next adventure](https://spectator.sme.sk/c/23276538/3-things-to-do-in-bratislava-for-free-in-the-next-seven-days.html) in the Small Carpathians (or check two other tips from us). In other news Most coalition voters (69 percent) are against reducing penalties for corruption, shows a [Focus poll](https://transparency.sk/sk/s-nizsimi-trestami-za-korupciu-nesuhlasia-ani-koalicni-volici/)(January 16 to 23) for Transparency International Slovakia. Speaking of the upcoming presidential election, the poll shows that 68 percent of Speaker Peter Pellegrini supporters are against the coalition’s proposal to reduce these penalties. As for Ivan Korčok supporters, the number stands at 88 percent. Unlike Korčok, Pellegrini sits in the Smer-led government that is pushing through the changes. Still, Pellegrini tops the polls. On Thursday, the presidential candidate Ivan Korčok challenged his rival Peter Pellegrini to a debate on the government’s proposed changes to the Penal Code. Korčok opposes them. He wanted the debate to take place in Banská Bystrica, Korčok and Pellegrini’s hometown. Pellegrini refused to take part in the debate, saying that people’s real problems are different from one bill debated in the chamber. Last year, Slovakia produced the most electricity from nuclear power in its history. Five nuclear units, three in Mochovce and two in Jaslovské Bohunice, produced 18,344 gigawatt hours of electricity in 2023. (SITA) Defence Minister Robert Kaliňák (Smer) presented the publication “Abduction of justice between 2020 and 2023” at a press conference on Thursday. The 140-page book presents 140 cases in which human rights were massively violated, he claimed. The cabinet justifies changes to the Penal Code by the alleged massive violation of human rights. - The European Commission will not hesitate to take any measures that may be necessary to ensure compliance with European Union law, European Commissioner for Justice Věra Jourová said in response to the open letter of the families of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová and the non-governmental organisations Zastavme Korupciu, Transparency International Slovakia, INEKO and Via Iuris. The letter, which criticises changes to the Penal Code, was signed by more than 38,000 people. (SITA) - The over 30,000-strong crowd in Bratislava protested against the government on Thursday evening. The crowd was joined by hundreds and thousands of people from 29 other Slovak towns. It is estimated that 60,000 people took to the streets, according to the [Sme daily](https://domov.sme.sk/c/23276991/protesty-proti-vlade-1-2-reportaz.html). Look at the photos from the Prešov protest in eastern Slovakia. WEATHER FOR FRIDAY: Cloudy skies. In places, especially in the north, you can expect snowfall, rain in locations up to 600 m. The highest daytime temperature will range from 0°C to 8°C. A yellow fog warning is in place in central and eastern Slovakia.

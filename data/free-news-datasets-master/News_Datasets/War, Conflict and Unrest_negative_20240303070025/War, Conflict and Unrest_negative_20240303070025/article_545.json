    "text": "Baghdad-INA Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that the decrease in US aid to Kiev sends a bad message, at a time when US President Joe Biden faces a Republican blockade that prevents him from providing further support. With the possibility of a decline in US aid, Zelensky urged Germany to throw its economic weight into mobilizing partners in the European Union in order to provide more support to Kiev in its battle against Russia. “US passivity or lack of support will send a bad signal,” he told German radio ARD. In response to a question about whether he hoped that Berlin would play a greater role in the event of a decline in US aid, Zelensky replied, “Germany may be able to mobilize the European Union countries.” He added, “Many countries have important economic relations with Germany and their economies depend on Germany’s decisions, because Germany has a strong economy.” In a separate interview on Wednesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged European countries to increase the weapons provided to Ukraine, raising the possibility of stopping aid provided by the largest shareholder, the United States. “Europe must do more to support Ukraine in its defense” of itself, Schulz told the weekly newspaper Die Zeit, adding that the contributions allocated by European countries for 2024 “are not large enough.” Biden has made supporting Ukraine a priority, and US weapons and financial aid have played a crucial role in helping the pro-Western country in its battle against Russia. But Republican lawmakers have led a campaign to stop those efforts, refusing to pass new budget aid unless Democrats first agree to take sweeping, tough measures against illegal immigration at the border with Mexico. As the US presidential elections approach, which may once again pit Biden against Donald Trump, Zelensky warned that the return of the former Republican president to the White House would likely lead to a “different policy” regarding the war. 2024-02-01 23:23:03",

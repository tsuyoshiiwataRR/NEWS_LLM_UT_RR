    "text": "NEW DELHI, Feb 1 : India on Thursday raised concern over the “deteriorating situation” in Myanmar and sought early resolution of the issue for peace and stability in the country. Addressing a weekly press conference here, a spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Randhir Jaiswal said, “India wants an early resolution of the issue and return of peace and stability in the country”. “We are concerned about the deteriorating situation in Myanmar which has direct implications on us as a neighbouring county and a friend of Myanmar” the spokesperson added. He said that India has been advocating for a complete succession of violence and Myanmar’s transition towards inclusive federal democracy”. On 1 February 2021, the military detained top political leaders and government officials in Yangon and other cities, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint. According to the United Nations, thousands have subsequently been killed, and over two million driven from their homes. As per the agency, across Myanmar, 18.6 million people one-third of the population require humanitarian support, compared to one million before the military takeover. Replying to a query on the India-US Drone deal, Jaiswal said “This particular matter relates to the US side. They have their internal processes in place and we respect that”. On video of Indian grazers confronting the Chinese PLA near India China border in Ladakh, the spokesperson said people of both countries are well aware of their areas of grazing and there is a mechanism to deal with it.

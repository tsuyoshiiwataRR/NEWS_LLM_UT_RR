    "text": "An unruly JetBlue Airways passenger on Tuesday was restrained by multiple fliers and turned over to law enforcement upon landing in New York City from London, the airline said.\nThe chaotic scene was captured on video and posted on Instagram .\nJetBlue said Thursday the incident occurred on flight 1926 from London to New York City.\nThe name of the rowdy passenger was not released. JetBlue also didn’t specify if the passenger was arrested upon the flight landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport.\nAccording to the flight-tracking site, FlightAware , the flight, which took off seven minutes early, landed 26 minutes early at 3:16 p.m.\nThe incident occurred when the passenger “began acting erratically and aggressively toward his travel companion and members of the inflight crew,” the statement said.\nThe crew found an “open bottle of liquor the customer brought onboard and indications of intoxication,” JetBlue said.\n“For everyone’s safety, the customer was restrained with the assistance of other customers who were witnessing this threatening behavior. The flight landed safely at New York’s JFK Airport where it was met by law enforcement who took over the situation. We appreciate our customers’ assistance and understanding during this incident and apologize for the experience,” the statement said.\nApparent video of the incident shows at least four men attempting to physically restrain another man aboard the flight. While the men are trying to get the passenger under control, multiple people are seen standing up as the tussle moves from the aisle, into an aisle seat and then back into the aisle.\nPeople are heard shouting orders, like “I need you to back up.” A woman is also on the video and appears to say, “Babe, babe, stop fighting them! Stop fighting them! Babe!”\nShortly after, a man, who is attempting to physically restrain the passenger, also is heard saying, “Take him down!”\nAt times, the men trying to subdue the passenger move their arms and hands toward the man’s head and neck as he tries to wiggle free. What appears to be a woman’s voice is also heard sobbing, according to the video.\nJetBlue did not immediately respond Thursday afternoon to a question about whether the Instagram video was shot aboard flight 1926.\nPort Authority police about 3:15 p.m. on Tuesday received a report of a disturbance aboard JetBlue flight 1926. No arrest was made by them, an agency representative said on Thursday.\nOther videos that circulated around Thanksgiving, captured passengers allegedly causing chaos aboard two Frontier Airlines’ flights, one in which a woman pulled her pants down, horrifying onlookers. Another video showed a passenger yelling, midflight, she was being kidnapped.\nBad behavior on commercial flights rose 47% globally in 2022 compared with the previous year, according to data released in June by the International Air Transport Association, an airline trade group.\nIn April, federal officials said they referred more than 250 unruly airline passengers to the FBI for possible criminal prosecution since late 2021.\nThe post Unruly customer restrained by other passengers on flight from London to NYC appeared first on NBC News .",

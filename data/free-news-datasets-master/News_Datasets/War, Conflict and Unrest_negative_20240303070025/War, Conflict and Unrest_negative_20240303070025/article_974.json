    "text": "A Message from Timothy Moore, Acting Executive Director, The Border Consortium On this solemn day, marking the third anniversary of the military coup in Myanmar on 1st February 2021, we at The Border Consortium (TBC) pause to reflect on the profound and ongoing impacts of the crimes against humanity committed by Myanmar’s armed forces. As we look back over these three years, it is with a heavy heart that we acknowledge the continued and escalating violence perpetrated by the Myanmar armed forces against civilians and their homes, schools, hospitals and places of worship. Such actions not only violate fundamental human rights but also hinder the path to peace and stability in the region. TBC remains steadfast in its condemnation of these atrocities. Our mission is rooted in the principles of justice, human dignity, and the right of all individuals to live free from fear and persecution. We recognise that the path to healing and rebuilding for the people of Myanmar is a long and arduous one. However, we remain committed to standing in solidarity with the conflict-affected communities in Myanmar and Thailand. Our efforts, aimed at providing humanitarian assistance and advocating for the rights and needs of these communities, are more crucial than ever. We continue to work tirelessly together towards a just and sustainable solution for the nation of Myanmar, a solution that respects the rights of all its people. On this day of remembrance, we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to supporting the people of Myanmar. We urge the international community to join us amplifying the voices of conflict-affected Myanmar people, and working towards a future where every individual can live in dignity, security, and prosperity. Together, we can make a difference. Together, we can help build a future that is just and peaceful for Myanmar. Timothy Moore Acting Executive Director The Border Consortium",

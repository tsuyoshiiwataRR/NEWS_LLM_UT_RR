    "text": "A single bullet, somewhere between Tal Al-Hawa and Sheikh Radwan neighborhoods, in northern Gaza. The bullet was fired by a Palestinian sniper with Al-Qassam Brigades, using al-Ghoul sniper gun. Prior to the firing, three Israeli military men stood in the middle of a destroyed neighborhood. What appeared to be an officer pointed into several directions, giving instructions to his troops. He seemed confident that the Resistance, in that specific spot, had been eliminated. But it wasn’t. The Israeli officer fell, and his soldiers ran away. This was one of several scenes shared in several videos throughout the day. Again and again, it is clear that the battle in the north is not finished. In fact, it is gaining momentum. Below are the latest statements by the two main Resistance forces in Gaza, and the Lebanese Resistance Movement Hezbollah. The statements below were communicated via their Telegram channels and are published here in their original form. Al-Qassam Brigades (Hamas) “Al-Qassam fighters successfully targeted a group of occupation soldiers barricaded inside a house west of the city of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip with an anti-fortification TBG shell, leaving them dead and wounded. “Al-Qassam Brigades target a D9 military bulldozer with a tandem shell west of the city of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip. “After their return from the combat lines, our fighters confirmed that they targeted three Zionist vehicles with Al-Yassin 105 shells on the outskirts of Sheikh Radwan in Gaza City. “Al-Qassam Brigades bombarded enemy gatherings west of Gaza City with heavy-caliber mortar shells.

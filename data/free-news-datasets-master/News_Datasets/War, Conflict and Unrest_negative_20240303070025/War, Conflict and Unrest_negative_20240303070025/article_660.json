Photo: Alexander Mahmoud\nA dangerous object was found at the Israeli embassy in Stockholm at 1pm on Wednesday.\n– It is the embassy staff themselves who found the object that was suspected to be dangerous, says police spokesperson Rebecca Landberg.\nAt 3 p.m., the police announced that the object, which was judged to be sharp, had been destroyed, reports TV4. The object was found outside the embassy grounds, but in close proximity to it.\nAccording to information to both Aftonbladet and Expressen, it is a hand grenade, but this is not confirmed by the police.\nThe embassy did not have to be evacuated during the operation. A preliminary investigation into gross destruction of public danger and gross illegal threats has been initiated.\nIsrael’s ambassador to Sweden Ziv Nevo Kulman comments on the incident on X:\n“Today we were subjected to an attempted attack against the Israeli embassy in Stockholm and its employees. We thank the Swedish authorities for their swift action. We will not be intimidated by terror,” writes the ambassador.\nIn a post on X, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson calls the incident “very serious” and “an attempted attack” against those who work at the embassy and against Sweden.",

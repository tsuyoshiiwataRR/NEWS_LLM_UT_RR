More content below\nGeneral Gheorghiță Vlad, Romania's Deputy Chief of Defence Staff, believes that the Romanian people, like all Europeans, should prepare for the potential spread of Russian aggression, which Putin will escalate if he wins in Ukraine.\nSource: Gheorghiță Vlad in an interview with the Romanian service of Radio Liberty on 1 February, reports European Pravda\nDetails: Vlad emphasised that Russia \"has become a problem for the world order and for democracy,\" and thus it is waging war not just against Ukraine but also \"with the democratic world.\" \"The population of Romania, like the entire population of the European Union and Europe, should be worried, and we should take appropriate measures to be ready,\" he said in a statement.\nThe Romanian General Staff chief emphasised that if Russia wins in Ukraine, it will most likely attack Moldova, escalating the situation in the Western Balkans.\nQuote: \"I am more than confident that President Putin will escalate in the near future,\" Vlad said.\nThe Romanian military leadership urged NATO countries to replenish arms stocks and prepare the population, most likely by instituting voluntary military service for the entire population.\nBackground:\nSimilar statements have recently been made by the military leadership of many other countries. For instance, Boris Pistorius, Federal Minister of Defence of Germany, said that Russia might attack a NATO country in the near future.\nSwedish Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Micael Bydén and Minister for Civil Defence Carl-Oskar Bohlin said all citizens should be prepared for war.\nAnd the Commander-in-Chief of Norway's Armed Forces urged not to waste the \"window of opportunity\" to prepare for a possible direct confrontation with Russia, as this time could be limited in a few years.\nSupport UP or become our patron !\nView comments",

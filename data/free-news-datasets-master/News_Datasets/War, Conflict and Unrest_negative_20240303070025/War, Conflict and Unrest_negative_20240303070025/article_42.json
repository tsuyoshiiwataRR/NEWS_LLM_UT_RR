    "text": "Russia said is encouraging Ukraine to commit atrocities with the new delivery of long-range munitions. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to Washington, made the comments in light of the GLSDB (Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb) munitions (which can hit targets at a distance of up to 150km) that are already on their way to Ukraine.\nOn Wednesday, during a visit to Kyiv, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland confirmed that the long-range munitions are en route to Ukraine for use during the war. Nuland, a foreign policy war hawk, is widely seen as one of the key figures in the 2014 Maidan coup which led to the toppling of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich and plunged the country into turmoil.\nAccording to a report by RT, the US official ended up in the media spotlight after she infamously handed out pastries to protesters in the Ukrainian cap.\nAntonov said that the U.S.’s insistence upon delivering lethal aid to Ukraine means that they are now a part of the war. He dubbed it “irresponsible” and “simply shocking” saying that delivery of these weapons is “a kind of a reaction to the terrorist attack by Ukrainian thugs”\n“Instead of admitting the horrific crime of its ‘clients’, the United States is sending them new deadly products. Thusly, not even with words, but with deeds, America incites its puppets to new atrocities,” Antonov said. Additionally, the envoy noted that Nuland’s announcement “essentially disavows any White House declarations about its willingness to put the conflict to an end as soon as possible.” On the contrary, Antonov added, these actions indicate Washington’s intention to “prolong the agony of the Kyiv regime. Even if this means new casualties, including among the civilian population of Russia and Ukraine.”\nRussia continues to assert that Ukraine is killing and injuring innocent civilians with the military equipment supplied to it by the U.S. Russia has also consistently denounced Western arms shipments to Ukraine, arguing that they will only prolong the conflict.\n[Biden Confirms U.S. Abrams Tanks Will Arrive In Ukraine Next Week]",

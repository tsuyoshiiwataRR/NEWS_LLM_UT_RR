    "text": "Due to “security conditions” in the border area with Guatemala, the United States government has raised the travel alert to 2 for citizens who plan to travel to Ciudad Hidalgo, Chiapas, Mexico and is warning U.S. government employees to that area. I have been stopped from going. The travel warning was issued by the United States Embassy in Mexico on January 31 and refers to Ciudad Hidalgo, Chiapas, Mexico. “The United States Embassy in Mexico City has informed American citizens that due to recent security incidents, United States Government employees will not be able to travel to the city of Ciudad Hidalgo, including its surrounding areas within a radius of 10 kilometers (6.2 mi). ), located in the southern part of the state of Chiapas on the border between Mexico and Guatemala,” the travel warning reads. It's worth noting that the State Department's travel warning level for Chiapas is 2, meaning people should be extra cautious due to crime. They also asked their citizens to pay attention to incidents in those areas through local media and to dial 911 in case of emergency. Another recommendation is to follow instructions from local officials as well as review personal safety plans. alert level The United States government has four levels of travel alerts for its citizens. - The lowest level is 1 and travelers are asked to take general precautions. - Level 2 is where increased precautions are requested. - Level 3 is one that recommends reconsidering your trip - Level 4 is the highest and it is advised not to travel there Situation in Chiapas There has been a dispute between drug trafficking gangs over control of territory in that state, which borders Guatemala, according to Mexican media reports. It is noted that there are armed conflicts, displacement, kidnappings, banditry and road blockades in the area. There are also reports of more than two thousand indigenous people being displaced from their communities due to disputes over territory between drug groups, which are linked to other organized crime groups and gangs.",

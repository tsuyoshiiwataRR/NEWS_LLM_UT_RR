    "text": "With Ukrainian drones again attacking Russian oil refineries this week, Russia's Energy Ministry is cutting exports of gasoline by 37 percent and diesel by 23 percent. Wednesday's announcement came hours after a drone caused a major fire at the Nevsky Mazut oil tank farm in downtown St. Petersburg. On Monday, a Ukrainian drone crashed harmlessly on the grounds of the Slavneft-Yanos oil refinery in Yaroslavl, 500 miles from the Ukrainian border. Last week, Ukrainian drones attacked energy facilities in five other cities in European Russia. The operation coincides with Ukraine targeting fuel logistics behind Russia's front lines. Ukraine's Defense Ministry on Thursday reported two record months of destroyed fuel tanks and trucks: 937 in January and 931 in December. Gasoline and diesel are the lifeblood of modern armies. The US Defense Department is the largest energy consumer in the country, if not the world. In 1942, Nazi Germany's “Desert Fox,” General Erwin Rommel, made a famous argument regarding fuel: “Neither guns nor ammunition are of much use in mobile warfare, unless they can be carried around. “There may not be enough petrol vehicles to go.” In November of that year, his tanks ran out of fuel while fighting for control of eastern Libya. Six months later, in May 1943, the famed Afrika Korps surrendered to Allied forces. Russia has the world's largest oil reserves – about 100 billion barrels. Yet the challenge is finding parts to repair refineries that were built with Western technology in the 2000s. “Just as you can't replace a faulty clutch in a BMW with an identical part in a Russian-made Lada, the same applies across the industry,” Sergei Vakulenko, an oil industry analyst at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, wrote last week. “It is difficult to replace compressors, valves, control units and other parts of equipment due to restrictions.” Two weeks ago, a Ukrainian drone attacked Lukoil's Kstovo refinery in Nizhny Novgorod, a city 260 miles east of Moscow. Compressor fire halts production at Russia's biggest refinery. Predicting a shutdown of several months, Mr. Vakulenko wrote: “Lukoil will almost certainly experience significant difficulties in integrating non-original parts. In a worst-case scenario, the refinery may even need to acquire entirely new equipment. “If we are seeing the beginning of a wave of attacks on Western Russia's oil refineries, the consequences will be grave,” he concluded in an article titled “Russia's oil industry threatened by Ukrainian drones, Western sanctions.” Ukrainian maritime drones could prove just as damaging to Russia's energy industry as aerial drones. Three maritime drones attacked in the Black Sea on Thursday ivanovets, a $65 million Russian missile corvette. It sank within minutes. Apparently, most of the crew of 50 abandoned ship safely. “As a result of a series of direct hits on the hull, the Russian ship received damage incompatible with forward speed – ivanovets “Listed to the stern and sank,” the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine said on its Telegram channel. Posting a black-and-white video of the early-morning attack, the intelligence agency said the boat was destroyed by troops from its “Group 13” operating covertly on Lake Donuzlav, a bay on the western edge of Russia-controlled Crimea. was given. A month earlier, a similar Tarantul-class corvette had sunk in Hrafska Bay off Sevastopol. Last fall, Ukrainian missile and maritime drone attacks pushed the Russian fleet out of the western and central Black Sea. This lifted Russia's naval blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea ports. In the four months since Ukraine opened the grain export corridor, about 500 cargo ships have used the route. In December, Ukraine's exports from three ports in the Odessa region reached 6.3 million tons, close to pre-war levels. Before the war, these ports – Odessa, Chornomorsk and Pivdenny – handled about half of all Ukraine's exports. Even without a navy, Ukraine is defeating the Russian Navy. Largely a legacy of the Soviet Union, Russia's navy was considered the third most powerful in the world before the war, behind the navies of the US and China. In nearly two years of drone warfare, Ukraine has sunk or damaged nearly half of the 80 ships of Russia's pre-war Black Sea Fleet. with Thursday's sunset ivanovets23 Russian warships have been sunk. Another 13 suffered major damage. In revenge, Russia has attacked nearly 200 Ukrainian port facilities since July, killing five port workers and wounding 23. “Satellite imagery indicates Ukrainian attacks caused Russian forces to move [Black Sea fleet] The assets range from occupied Sevastopol to ports on the eastern side of the Black Sea, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War reports. Analyzing the photos by Planet Labs, the non-profit concluded: “Recent satellite imagery indicates that ships taken to Novorossiysk during the fall have not returned to Sevastopol.” Now, some analysts fear that Ukraine's next move is to hit back at Russia and block Russian exports from its own Black Sea ports. Novorossiysk, Russia's busiest Black Sea port, is Russia's third-largest oil exporting port, after two ports near St. Petersburg. Russia is the world's largest exporter of wheat, about 70 percent of which comes from Novorossiysk and nearby Taman. Eurasia Group Chairman Ian Bremmer is concerned that Ukraine will “target oil and grain facilities on the Black Sea which could again disrupt global markets.” Writing in Time magazine before the EU approved a $54 billion aid package to Ukraine on Thursday, Mr Bremer said: “Kiev is becoming increasingly more desperate. “It is trying its best to increase its domestic defense production, especially of drones for the battlefield and to strike targets inside Russia.” To President Zelensky this seems like appeasement. At the World Economic Forum in Davos two weeks ago he said of the “don't escalate” mantra: “Every 'don't escalate' to us sounded like “you shall prevail” to Putin. …This concept Nothing has harmed our alliance more than Russia.'' Separately, in an interview with France's Le Monde newspaper, Ukraine's top premier Kirill Budanov recently reviewed Ukraine's attacks on Crimea and energy targets. Of. Looking to 2024, he promised: “This is just the beginning.” Source: www.nysun.com",

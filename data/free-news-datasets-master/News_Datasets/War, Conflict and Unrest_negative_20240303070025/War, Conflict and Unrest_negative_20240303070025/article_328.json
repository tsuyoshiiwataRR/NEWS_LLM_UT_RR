    "text": "breaking\nTransit union accepts recommendations aimed at preventing possible Metro Vancouver strike\n 1:36 pm.\nLast Updated February 1, 2024 2:09 pm.\nThere’s been a positive step in the ongoing labour dispute between CUPE 4500 Coast Mountain Bus Company, with the union announcing Thursday it has accepted recommendations aimed at ending the impasse.\nCUPE 4500, which represents about 180 transit supervisors with CMBC, says it has accepted the plan from special mediator Vince Ready, noting the recommendations “represent an acceptable compromise” for unionized workers. It is now urging CMBC to also accept the recommendations so further job action can be cancelled.\nAccording to the union, Ready’s plan “takes sufficient steps to addressing the key issues” of its members.\n“While they don’t completely address our issues, these recommendations are clearly our best path towards a mutually acceptable settlement. We are calling on Coast Mountain to accept them and avoid any further disruptions for transit users,” said Liam O’Neill, spokesperson for CUPE 4500.\nThe union was threatening to launch another shutdown of bus and SeaBus service as early as Saturday, if an agreement was not reached by 12:01 a.m. Feb. 3. This escalation would last 72 hours.\nCUPE 4500 says it still stands by this plan if both sides can’t come to a deal by that deadline.\n“We don’t see any reason to leave transit users in a state of uncertainty. We hope Coast Mountain will be quick in its deliberations and make its intentions clear,” said O’Neill. “For the sake of transit users, and the on-going relationship between CUPE 4500 members and Coast Mountain, let us put this dispute behind us.”\nThe looming escalation of strike action comes as a Labour Relations Board hearing continues, with the union seeking permission to also set up pickets at SkyTrain stations, TransLink facilities, and BC Transit sites in the\nFraser Valley and Victoria.\nIf the board agrees with CUPE 4500’s arguments, and if the union follows through with its threat, that could effectively shut down all transit services — including SkyTrain — in Metro Vancouver and the other regions.\nHowever, the transit authorities have been trying to have those additional sites designated as\nessential services, shielding them from being shut down by labour action.\nIn January, CUPE 4500’s transit supervisors began an overtime ban as a first step. Later in the month, on Jan. 22 at 3 a.m., the union launched new strike action, with bus and SeaBus service in Metro Vancouver grounding to a halt for 48 hours.\nOn Jan. 24, the province\nappointed Ready as a special mediator to help resolved the dispute between CUPE 4500 and CMBC. He had already been acting as a mediator before talks broke down between the two sides.",

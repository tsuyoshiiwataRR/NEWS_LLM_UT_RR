    "text": "China has told Ukraine that their bilateral relations could be damaged by Kyiv’s designation of more than a dozen Chinese companies as “international sponsors of war”, two senior Ukrainian sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nThe warning was communicated to Ukraine last month at a meeting of China’s ambassador to Kyiv with senior Ukrainian government officials, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nChina’s foreign ministry, the Chinese embassy in Kyiv and Ukraine’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nBeijing has close ties with Moscow and has refrained from criticising Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but it has also said the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected. It has offered to help mediate in the war.\nUkraine has listed 48 companies globally, including 14 from China, as “international sponsors of war” whose business activities it says indirectly assist in or contribute to Russia’s war efforts.\n“The ambassador said that all this (the situation with the blacklist) could have a negative impact on our relations,” said one of the sources.\nThe source added that China had not set any conditions or “temporary frameworks” for Ukraine as a result but had simply expressed its view about the list.\nThe second source suggested that Beijing could link the matter to Chinese purchases of Ukrainian grain.\nBefore Russia’s full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, China was Ukraine’s biggest trade partner and it remains an important consumer of Ukrainian grain, sunflower oil and iron ore.\nThe blacklist, which has no legal implications for the firms it includes, takes issue with what it describes as extensive cooperation between Chinese and Russian companies in sectors including oil and gas, the main source of revenue for Moscow.\nIt features Chinese energy giants China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec Group) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).\nSinopec and CNOOC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CNPC stated that the list was not a new development.\n‘REPUTATIONAL TOOL’\nUkraine’s National Agency for Corruption Prevention describes the blacklist as a “powerful reputational tool for achieving the benevolence of elements of global supply chains (and) the exit of international business from Russia”.\nThough China is widely seen as an ally of the Kremlin, Ukraine has been careful not to anger the world’s second largest economy throughout its war with Moscow, and it has repeatedly appealed to Beijing to join Kyiv’s diplomatic efforts for peace.\nUkraine has been promoting its blueprint for peace at a series of high-level international meetings. China attended one of the meetings in Jeddah last year, but it has since refrained from attending.\nChina was the main destination for Ukrainian food exports shipped under a UN-brokered grain corridor established after Russia’s invasion but now defunct. It accounted for around 7.9 million metric tons of the total 30 million tons transported via that route.\nUnder Kyiv’s new Black Sea shipping corridor established last August, government data shows, some 30% of Ukraine’s maritime exports, including food, metals and ore, were shipped to China.\nWith 14, China has the most companies on the blacklist, followed by the United States, France and Germany which have eight, four and four respectively.\nChina said on Tuesday that Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong met with Ukraine’s ambassador to Beijing and exchanged views on issues of common concern, and that Sun had said the countries should respect and treat each other sincerely\nSource: Reuters ( Reporting by Tom Balmforth and Pavel Polityuk; Additional reporting by Liz Lee and Andrew Hayley in Beijing; editing by Mike Collett-White and Gareth Jones)\n2024-02-02 ",

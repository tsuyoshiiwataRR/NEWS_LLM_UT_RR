    "text": "US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has warned it is a “dangerous moment” in the Middle East in his first press conference since three American soldiers were killed in a Jordan last week.\nSky News Washington Correspondent Anneliese Nielsen says this echoes what has been heard from the White House for a few days.\n“This is the first time we’ve heard from Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin after these three soldiers were killed in a press conference format,” she said.\n“The message was quite clear that this is a dangerous time in the Middle East, and they are prepared for things to potentially continue.”\nShe said the US government keeps saying its response is going to be a “multi-tiered” one.\n“Giving the idea that there’s not going to be a single retribution strike against Iran who’s widely assumed to have backed these militia that have been launching these attacks, including this drone strike in Jordan that killed the three US soldiers and injured more than 40 others.”\nUS Defence Secretary warns it is a ‘dangerous moment’ in the Middle East",

    "text": "NORFOLK, Va. — Sailors on a Norfolk-based guided-missile destroyer had a close call with a Houthi missile Tuesday. USS Gravely (DDG 107) shot down an anti-ship missile fired by Houthi rebels, according to U.S. Central Command. That missile came within a mile of the ship in the Red Sea, which was the closest call yet, according to a defense official. This comes as the U.S. prepares to retaliate following a series of attacks in the Middle East, including a drone strike in Jordan that killed three American troops. On Thursday, U.S. Senator Mark Warner (D-Va.) shared his support for how the Navy has responded but also said it’s time to take it up a notch. \"One of the things Naval personnel are doing, they have done a remarkable job of taking down, whether it’s Houthi rockets, Houthi drones,\" said Warner. RELATED: Norfolk-based USS Gravely shoots down Houthi anti-ship missile Warner said moving forward, the response needs to shift focus. \"We have been mostly focused in Yemen on taking out their missile launching capacity. I think we may need to go to their command control because simply taking out their missile launching capacity is not enough,\" said Warner. Between the recent unprecedented missile strikes and a drone attack in Jordan that left three U.S. troops dead and more than 40 injured, Warner said it’s time to do more. \"The President has said he will strike back, he needs to strike back forcefully,\" said Warner. \"I want the President to move quickly, but I also want him to do this in a fashion that sends an extraordinarily strong message to Iran and its proxies that they cannot take potshots and go unanswered, particularly when American lives are in danger.\" RELATED: Following deaths of 3 Army Reserve soldiers in drone attack in Jordan, world awaits U.S. response He also said it's important not to make the conflict bigger. \"I also think we need to bear in mind, the last thing in the world we need is to broaden this conflict in the Middle East at this moment.\" As the conflict continues, Warner said he wants to thank the sailors who are serving. \"To all of our soldiers and sailors that are in harm's way and their families, I say: God bless you and we appreciate the service of your sons and daughters and brothers and sisters,\" he said. Warner said he thinks we will see action from the U.S. soon. It’s just a matter of where and when. \"I think we will see action soon, whether that is 24, 48, 72 hours, I don’t know. But I think it’s better to do this right than to simply do it quickly.\" National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday the response would involve multiple targets and that “the first thing you see won’t be the last thing.”",

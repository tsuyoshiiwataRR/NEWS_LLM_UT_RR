    "text": "Israeli forces abducted, on Thursday, seven Palestinians, and confiscated three vehicles near the northern West Bank cities of Jenin and Nablus. In the northern West Bank, Israeli forces abducted Firas Nimr Hamdan, Ahmed Musa Asfour, Muhammad Hussein Nimr Lahlouh, and Ahmed Fathi Arda, after invading and ransacking their homes in the town of Arraba, southwest of Jenin. Before dawn Thursday, occupation forces stormed Salem village, east of Nablus in the northern West Bank, broke into and ransacked several homes, and abducted two Palestinians. Two infantry squads were deployed in several neighborhoods, while soldiers abducted two young men, identified as Uday Adnan Shtayyeh and Yahya Suleiman Shtayyeh, when they attempted to pass through a flying military checkpoint, near the village. Meanwhile, soldiers invaded the village of Beit Iba west of Nablus, stormed a residential building, and abducted Ayham Abu Ghalioun, after storming his home. South of the city, Israeli forces confiscated three vehicles belonging to Palestinian citizens at a military roadblock at the entrance to the village of As-Sawiya. Furthermore, several military jeeps stormed the the “New Nablus” area in the city, invaded and ransacked the Hawash family home, and interrogated the family.",

    "text": "February 1, 2024 | Flash Brief\nHamas Smashed in Khan Younis\nFebruary 1, 2024 | Flash Brief\nHamas Smashed in Khan Younis\nLatest Developments\nIsraeli forces have dismantled Hamas’s brigade in Khan Younis, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant\nsaid on February 1, updating the enemy casualty toll in the Gaza war to 20,000. “They have 10,000 dead terrorists and another 10,000 wounded who are not functioning. It’s a blow that is eroding their ability [to fight],” Gallant https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/gallant-says-army-will-push-south-to-rafah-as-khan-younis-offensive-wraps-up/ during a visit to Khan Younis, the southern hub city of the Gaza Strip. Israel previously killed the commanders of the Northern Gaza Brigade and of the Central Gaza Brigade as well as at least three battalion commanders within the Gaza City Brigade.\n“We are completing the mission in Khan Younis, and we will also reach Rafah and we will kill every terrorist there who tries to harm us,” Gallant\nhttps://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-2-1-2024-a7e3f4be50d773c1f5919ffacf6c9dd4#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Khan%20Younis,to%20harm%20us.%E2%80%9D, referring to the Gazan city that abuts the Egyptian border and that Israeli forces have so far skirted amid concern for displaced Palestinians who have been congregating there.\nExpert Analysis\n“Before it launched this war against Israel on October 7, Hamas had an estimated 30,000 terrorists. That fighting force has now been two-thirds depleted, with 10,000 terrorists eliminated and another 10,000 terrorists who are wounded and not returning to the battlefield. Hamas is fast running out of hiding places. The impressive pace of Israeli gains in this only four-month-old offensive may provide Israeli leaders with the latitude to enter a time-limited ceasefire for the recovery of hostages.” —\nMark Dubowitz, FDD CEO\n“Supporters of Hamas, including Qatar, like to claim there is no military solution to Hamas, only a political one. That is a lie that Israel’s military is exposing day after day.” —\nRichard Goldberg, FDD Senior Advisor\nRelated Analysis\n“\nIsrael, Hamas Weigh Three-Stage Deal for Return of Hostages,” FDD Insight\n“\nIsrael, Egypt Consider Shared Border Security,” FDD Flash Brief\n“\nIsrael Increases Pressure on Hamas Terrorists in Khan Younis,” FDD Flash Brief\nIssues:\n[Israel](/issue/israel/) [Israel at War](/issue/israel-at-war/)",

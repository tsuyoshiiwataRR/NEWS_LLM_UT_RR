    "text": "BENTON CO., Wash. -- One man was arrested after an hours-long standoff at a trailer in Benton County. The standoff began around 3:30 p.m. Wednesday. Police said they were given a tip on the mans location and went to follow up. A drone and K9 units responded as well. The man was located in Benton County out by the vineyards just off of East Jacobs Road Northeast. The man was wanted by law enforcement for running from the scene after crashing a vehicle over the weekend, according to police. According to officials, the man who was arrested was wanted by several different law enforcement agencies. Benton County Sheriff Lt. Mike Clark said, \"He fled from one of our deputies, shortly down the road he had wrecked, fled from there, they had located a gun at that point. Ultimately, once they came out here and confirmed he was here, they were notified he was wanted out of Kennewick as well for a robbery from months ago.\" Officers attempted to try and verbally negotiate with the man for hours. Eventually, police said the man kicked out a window in the trailer he was hiding in and spoke face to face with law enforcement before he surrendered. Lt. Clark said the man did have a gun but officers were able to arrested the man just before 6:30 p.m. The man is facing charges for eluding and possession of a firearm. He is also facing charges out of Kennewick for robbery. No one was hurt. ​COPYRIGHT 2024 BY APPLE VALLEY NEWS NOW. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

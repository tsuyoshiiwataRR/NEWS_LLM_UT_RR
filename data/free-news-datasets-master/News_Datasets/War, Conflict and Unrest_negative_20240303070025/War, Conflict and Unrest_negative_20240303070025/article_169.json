    "text": "OAN’s [James Meyers](https://www.oann.com/tag/james-meyers) 2:10 PM – Thursday, February 1, 2024 With ongoing conflict in the Middle East ramping up, a Houthi missile almost took out a U.S. destroyer causing it to rely on its last line of defense. According to American officials, the terrorist group’s attack on Tuesday night against the USS Gravely came within a mile of the ship sailing on the Red Sea triggering its Close-In Weapons System, which is known as a last-line of defense. The missile was so close that the USS Gravely, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer was forced to rely on its Close-In Weapons System for the first time since the terrorist organization began attacking months ago. Arleigh Burke-class destroyers have this type of system equipped to perform close-range interceptions and destroy incoming missiles. The U.S. Central Command reported that no injuries or damages to the warship took place. Meanwhile, the terrorist group has launched over 30 missile and drone attacks in the Red Sea since November, which has caused massive disruptions to commercial shipping by way of water. In response to the attacks, Britain and the United States have carried out strikes targeting Houthi missile sites in Yemen. Additionally, the European Union announced they are launching a full naval mission in the Red Sea within the next three weeks to protect cargo ships from the Houthis. “We are prepared for a long-term confrontation with the forces of tyranny,” Houthi commander Muhammad al-Attifi said in a statement earlier this week.

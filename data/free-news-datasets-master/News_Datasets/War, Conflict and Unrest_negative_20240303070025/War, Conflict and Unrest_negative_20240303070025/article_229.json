    "text": "Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Galant said today that the United Nations Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) \"has lost the legitimacy to exist in its current form\", assessing that it is \"Hamas with a facelift\". \"Funds from countries around the world are channeled through UNRWA and used to strengthen terrorist infrastructure and pay terrorists,\" Galant told a delegation of UN ambassadors visiting Israel, Israeli media reported. The delegation was led by Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced, but did not specify who the members of the delegation were, nor which countries they represented, nor where they met. The statement added that the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) will continue to operate until they achieve their goals, the destruction of Hamas' military and governance capabilities and the return of the hostages to Israel. UNRWA, meanwhile, has again warned that it will no longer be able to function after February, given that many countries have suspended funding to the agency due to Israeli accusations that its employees participated in attacks on southern Israel on October 7, when the Israeli army's war against Hamas. As stated on Monday, the funds at its disposal could be used up by the end of February if more than a dozen countries do not back down from their decision to suspend support for the agency, due to accusations that 13 of its approximately 13.000 employees participated in unprecedented cross-border attacks. In those attacks, about 1.200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and about 250 hostages were kidnapped and taken to Gaza. More than 27.000 people were killed in Gaza, most of them women and children, in the Israeli revenge from the air, from the mines and from the sea, the Ministry of Health announced today.

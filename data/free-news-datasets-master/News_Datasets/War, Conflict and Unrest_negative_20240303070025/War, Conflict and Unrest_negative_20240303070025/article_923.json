    "text": "Question: On 30 January, Tom Tugendhat, Minister of State at the UK Home Office, claimed that the legislation on Article 23 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region would destroy the rule of law in Hong Kong and what made it prosperous. What is your comment?\nEmbassy Spokesperson: We firmly oppose this UK politician's groundless attack on the legislation on Article 23 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong. He has no right whatsoever to interfere in China's internal affairs.\nEnacting the legislation on the Basic Law Article 23 is the due obligation of the HKSAR to fulfill its constitutional responsibility to safeguard national security and implement the Basic Law, the relevant decisions of the National People's Congress, and the Law on Safeguarding National Security in HKSAR. It is also the pressing task to prevent, curb and punish acts and activities endangering national security. The legislation will protect the fundamental well-being of all HKSAR residents and the interests of global investors in Hong Kong, and better safeguard its long-term stability and security.\nThe UK just introduced its new National Security Act last year, yet now it is pointing fingers at the enacting of the legislation of the HKSAR. This is nothing but sheer double standard. We urge UK politicians to stop making irresponsible remarks on Article 23 legislation and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.",

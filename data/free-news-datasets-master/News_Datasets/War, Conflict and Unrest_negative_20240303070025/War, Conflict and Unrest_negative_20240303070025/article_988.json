    "text": "Ongoing military operations by Israel in Gaza have made it the deadliest and most dangerous war for journalists covering it \"in recent history\", UN independent human rights experts warned on Thursday.\nOver 120 journalists have lost their lives in Gaza since 7 October. Unsplash/Engin Akyurt Expressing deep concern, the Human Rights Council -appointed experts highlighted the alarming toll on journalists and media workers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in Gaza.\n\"We are alarmed at the extraordinarily high numbers of journalists and media workers who have been killed, attacked, injured and detained in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in Gaza, in recent months blatantly disregarding international law,\" the experts said .\nThe experts noted \"disturbing reports\" of attacks against media workers despite being clearly identifiable in jackets, helmets and vehicles marked \"press\", seemingly indicating a \"deliberate strategy\" by Israeli forces to obstruct and silence critical reporting.\nDozens dead Since 7 October, 122 journalists and media workers have lost their lives in the Gaza Strip, with many others sustaining injuries.",

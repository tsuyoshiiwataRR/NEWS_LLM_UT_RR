    "text": "WASHINGTON: The planned targets for US strikes in Iraq and Syria in response to the killing of three US soldiers by a drone in Jordan include \"Iranian personnel and facilities\", CBS News reported on Thursday (Feb 1), citing American officials.\nThe United States has assessed that the drone, which also wounded more than 40 people, was made by Iran, four US officials told Reuters. Sources said Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards were pulling senior officers out of Syria.\nThe CBS report follows days of conjecture about how Washington would retaliate after three US soldiers were killed on Saturday in a strike on their base .\nThe fatalities were the first US deaths in an escalation of violence across the Middle East since Israel's war in Gaza began in October.\nEven as fighting has intensified this week, diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave have accelerated.\nQatari and Egyptian mediators presented Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, with the first concrete proposal for an extended halt to fighting, agreed with Israel and the US at talks in Paris last week.\nA Palestinian official close to the negotiations told Reuters the text envisages a first phase of 40 days, during which fighting would cease while Hamas freed remaining civilians among the more than 100 hostages it still holds. Further phases would see the handover of Israeli soldiers and bodies of dead hostages.\nSuch a long pause would be a first since Oct 7, when Hamas fighters attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing 253 hostages, precipitating an Israeli offensive that has laid waste to much of Gaza.\nHealth officials in the enclave said on Thursday the confirmed Palestinian death toll had risen above 27,000, with thousands more dead still lying under the rubble.\nA Palestinian official said Hamas was unlikely to reject the proposal outright, but would demand guarantees that fighting would not resume, something Israel has not agreed to.\nRead more: Iran warns of decisive response to any type of attack Commentary: After a fatal strike, restraint becomes a challenging option for the US REPORTS OF CEASEFIRE DEAL ARE DENIED A positive-sounding speech by a Qatari spokesman at Johns Hopkins University in Washington briefly triggered some celebrations in Gaza - and a drop in the price of crude oil.\nBut a Qatari official in Doha told Reuters there was no ceasefire deal yet, and that Hamas had \"received the proposal positively\" but not responded yet.\nAnd Taher Al-Nono, media adviser to Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, told Reuters: \"We have received the proposal that was put together in Paris but we haven’t yet given a response to any of the parties.\"\n\"We can’t say that the current stage of negotiation is zero and at the same time we can’t say that we have reached an agreement.\"\nCelebratory firing into the air and cheering in central and southern Gaza were soon suppressed by an air strike on a house in Gaza's main southern city, Khan Younis, that wounded 13 people, according to hospital officials.\nIsrael started a huge ground assault last week to capture Khan Younis, and combat has also surged in northern areas that Israel claimed to have subdued weeks ago.\nDefence Minister Yoav Gallant said Israeli forces had now dismantled the Hamas brigade in Khan Younis, and that they had killed 10,000 Palestinian fighters and wounded the same number again since the war began nearly four months ago.\nHe said those forces would now press on to Rafah on the enclave's southern edge, where more than half of Gaza's 2.3 million people are sheltering, mainly cold and hungry in makeshift tents and public buildings.\nResidents said Israeli forces had pounded areas around hospitals in Khan Younis overnight, and stepped up attacks close to Rafah.\nOsama Ahmed, 49, a father of five from Gaza City now sheltering in western Khan Younis, said there had been fierce resistance in the city, and relentless bombardment from air, ground and sea as Israeli tanks advanced.\n\"They haven’t entered deep into Al-Mawasi where we live but every day they get closer,\" he told Reuters by phone. \"All we want is a ceasefire now.\"",

    "text": "Agencies must disconnect all exposed Ivanti products by Friday, CISA says The directive follows a related warning issued last month about cybersecurity flaws in Ivanti systems. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency [directed](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/supplemental-direction-v1-ed-24-01-mitigate-ivanti-connect-secure-and-ivanti-policy-secure) all federal agencies to disconnect themselves from a suite of Ivanti products by Friday, citing the discovery of two additional security vulnerabilities in the IT products. The directive from the Homeland Security Department’s civilian cyber agency follows a related Jan. 19 [warning](https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2024/01/cisa-directs-agencies-mitigate-widespread-vpn-bugs/393485/) that officials deemed serious, stressing that some 15 agencies involved in national security business were identified as using the targeted systems. “As soon as possible and no later than 11:59PM on Friday February 2, 2024, disconnect all instances of Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure solution products from agency networks,” CISA said in a Wednesday listing of required actions. Agencies must also notify CISA on Monday that they removed the equipment from their systems. Ivanti on Wednesday rolled out an extensive vulnerability [assessment list](https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/KB-CVE-2023-46805-Authentication-Bypass-CVE-2024-21887-Command-Injection-for-Ivanti-Connect-Secure-and-Ivanti-Policy-Secure-Gateways?language=en_US) about the products, noting that the exposures can allow hackers “to access restricted resources by bypassing control checks” and gain administrative privileges in compromised systems. A technical analysis by Google-owned Mandiant noted that China-linked hackers have attempted to leverage the weaknesses since [at least December](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/investigating-ivanti-zero-day-exploitation). At least 2,100 systems were flagged as infected in an initial [blog post](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2024/01/18/ivanti-connect-secure-vpn-exploitation-new-observations/) by cybersecurity firm Volexity.",

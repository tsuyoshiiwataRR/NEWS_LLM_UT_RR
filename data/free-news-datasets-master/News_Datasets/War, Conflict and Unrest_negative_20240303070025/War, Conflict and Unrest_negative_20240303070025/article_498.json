    "text": "Army chief identifies problems\nSaluschnyj: We have to prepare for reduced military aid\nFebruary 2, 2024, 12:13 a.m\nWhile the Ukrainian media speculates that Saluzhnyj will soon be deposed, the army chief publishes a comment about the defensive war against Russia. The top general also names some of the challenges that Kiev has to overcome in his opinion.\nAmid speculation about his impending dismissal, Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Valeriy Zalushnyj addressed massive supply problems in an opinion article. “We must contend with reduced military support from critical allies who are grappling with their own political tensions,” the general wrote in a statement\nWebsite of the US television channel CNN published essay. The partners’ stocks of rockets, missiles for anti-aircraft systems and artillery ammunition were coming to an end due to the intense fighting in Ukraine. There is also a global shortage of propellant charges.\nAccording to him, Russia has advantages in mobilizing soldiers. Without unpopular measures, Ukraine’s state institutions would not be able to compensate for this disadvantage. The government’s second bill on stricter mobilization measures is currently being discussed in the Ukrainian parliament. Due to legal restrictions and partial monopolization, there are also production bottlenecks, including ammunition, in the company’s own defense industry. “This deepens Ukraine’s dependence on supplies from its allies,” Saluzhny emphasized.\n“Our combat experience is unique”\nHe called for a new state system of technological upgrading to be created within the next five months. This is primarily about remote-controlled systems such as drones to reduce your own losses. It is crucial not to get involved in a trench warfare in which Ukraine has no advantage. The training of soldiers must also be adapted to new opportunities and existing restrictions.\n“Our combat experience, especially since 2022, is unique,” said Salushnyj. “But in the interest of victory, we must constantly find new ways and new capabilities that will help us gain an advantage over the enemy.”\nThe general did not address the rumors that have been circulating in Ukrainian and international media since Monday about differences of opinion with President Volodymyr Zelensky and his possible dismissal. There were also no assessments of developments along the 1,000-kilometer-long front line. Ukraine has been fending off a Russian invasion for almost two years with massive Western arms and financial aid. Saluzhnyj is credited with significant contributions to the successful defense of the capital Kiev and the reconquest of areas in eastern and southern Ukraine.",

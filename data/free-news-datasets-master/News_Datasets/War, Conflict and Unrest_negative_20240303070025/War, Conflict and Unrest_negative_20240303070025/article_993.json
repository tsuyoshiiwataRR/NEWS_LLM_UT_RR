    "text": "[London Chemical Attacker Is Ex-Asylum Seeker Say Sources](https://www.gbnews.com/news/london-chemical-attacker-asylum-seeker-new-cctv-image-released) Dimitris Kouimtsidis, GB News, February 1, 2024 The man behind the horrific [chemical attack in London](https://www.gbnews.com/news/clapham-common-corrosive-substance-thrown) is an ex-asylum seeker, sources have told GB News. It is understood that Abdul Shokoor Ezedi arrived into the UK in a lorry in 2016. He failed twice in previous applications to be granted asylum in the UK, before being ultimately successful. It has also been revealed that Ezedi was convicted of a sexual offence at Newcastle Crown Court in 2018, prior to being granted asylum. Sources have told GB News, that he was handed a suspended sentence for “sexual assault/exposure” with an unpaid work order. He was then discharged from probation supervision in 2020 when the work order was completed. This comes as the Metropolitan Police released a new image of Ezedi, who is currently on the run. Ezedi allegedly attacked a woman and her two children with a corrosive substance – now known to be alkaline – in Clapham, south London. Ezedi, [believed to be from the Newcastle area](https://www.gbnews.com/news/london-chemical-attacker-newcastle-woman-police-name-suspect), is alleged to have thrown an alkaline substance at the mother and her two daughters in a “targeted” attack which saw a total of 11 people taken to hospital. Following the attack, a huge manhunt was launched which included several forces, with the manhunt still ongoing. Police originally reported that he has injuries to the right side of his face and have now released a second image of the suspect, with the injuries clearly visible. Superintendent Gabriel Cameron said: “We are now releasing an image of the last known sighting of Abdul Shokoor Ezedi, which was on Caledonian Road, N1 at 20:48hrs on Thursday, January 31. “The image is taken from the Tesco store, where Ezedi is believed to have purchased a bottle of water. He left the shop and turned right. “The image shows Ezedi with what appears to be significant injuries to the right side of his face. This makes him distinctive. “If you see Ezedi, call 999 immediately. He should NOT be approached.” Superintendent Gabriel Cameron, a senior officer who polices in Lambeth, has updated on last night’s events: “Firstly, I want to acknowledge the considerable public concern following this terrible incident, and update on the injuries suffered by the victims. “The woman, who is aged 31, and her two daughters – aged eight and three – all remain in hospital. “While none of their conditions are life-threatening, the injuries to the woman and younger girl could be life-changing. “It may be some time before hospital staff are able to say how serious that might be. “Three women – two in their 30s and one in her 50s – who were injured when they bravely came to the aid of the family, have all been discharged from hospital with minor burns injuries. “A man in his 50s who also helped declined hospital treatment for minor injuries he suffered. “Five officers who were injured as they responded have all been treated and have left hospital.”",

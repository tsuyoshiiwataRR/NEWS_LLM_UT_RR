    "text": "Editor's Note: We are not releasing the name of the person who shot and killed Daniel Ortega because he has not been charged with a crime. YAKIMA, Wash. - Nearly a year after an unarmed man experiencing a mental health crisis was shot and killed in a Yakima dog park, Yakima County Prosecutor Joe Brusic spoke to Apple Valley News Now's Emily Goodell on why he decided not to file charges. Brusic said after looking at all of the evidence and the state's self-defense laws, he came to the conclusion that, if it went to trial, a jury would accept an argument for self-defense and find him [the shooter] not guilty. \"It's very easy for anyone in the community or law enforcement or anybody to look at Monday morning quarterbacking and to determine that he could have done various things,\" Brusic said. \"It's what we hear after officer-involved shootings.\" Brusic said in self-defense cases, they have to look at objective standards, or, what a reasonable person would do in that situation. \"You also look at what in this particular case Mr. Telles looked at subjectively at the time that this incident unfolded before him with his child,\" Brusic said. In the early afternoon on February 5, 2023, multiple witnesses called 911 and said a man, now known as Daniel Ortega, was trying to talk to people at the Randall Dog Park. Witnesses reported seeing Ortega cussing, yelling about a gun and acting erratically. It appeared to some witnesses that he was experiencing a mental health crisis or was on drugs. Authorities said Ortega then approached a man, who was with his child. Ortega began yelling about the child and refused to leave the park. The man then pulled out his gun when Ortega would not walk away. \"At the point where he was shot, just prior to that, he was about three feet away, which is exceptionally close,\" Brusic said. The man shot Ortega one time. Ortega died at the park. Nearly one year later, Brusic sent his decision to law enforcement. When asked why the process took so long, Brusic said a lot of work had to go into the case. \"We waited for the toxicology reports and those took a couple of months,\" Brusic said. \"Just the sheer workload that I have and that we all have in terms of evaluating the case. My apologies for obviously not getting this done sooner.\" Brusic said he included all the information relevant to his charging decision in his letter to law enforcement, but it doesn't say much about Ortega himself. He doesn't explain what he was going through at the time, how his death impacted his family, or how, in the middle of a mental health crisis, he ended up at the park in the first place. We'll have more on this story, which will air Monday, February 5, which marks one year since Ortega's death. MORE: DEADLY YAKIMA DOG PARK SHOOTING YAKIMA, Wash. - Yakima County Prosecutor Joe Brusic said he will not be charging the man who shot and killed another man at a dog park last February. YAKIMA, Wash. — Saying goodbye to a loved one always hurts, but for the family and friends of 22-year-old Daniel Ortega, that hurt is compounded by the fact that they still don’t know the circumstances that led up to his death. YAKIMA, Wash. — The community has more questions than answers when it comes to a shooting Sunday afternoon at the Randall Park dog park in Yakima that left 22-year-old Daniel Ortega dead.

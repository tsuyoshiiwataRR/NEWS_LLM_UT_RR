    "text": "The gunman standing inside the factory next to a drawing of the Palestinian flag and the words “the door will be opened for Gaza”\nTurkish police on Thursday released seven workers taken hostage by a pro-Palestinian gunman at a plant near Istanbul owned by US consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble in protest over the war in Gaza.\nPolice staged a raid nearly nine hours into the stand-off when the lone gunman took a bathroom break.\nThe man was detained unharmed, local governor Seddar Yavuz told reporters.\n“The man’s aim was to stop Israel’s massacre in Gaza and to open the Rafa gate in Egypt” for the delivery of humanitarian aid for trapped civilians, Yavuz said.\n“When he went out for a bathroom break, our security forces carried out an operation without harming the hostages.”\nAnxious relatives await news of the hostages near the Procter & Gamble factory in Gebze – Dilara Senkaya/Reuters\nPhotos and videos of the assailant shared online by one of the hostages showed a man – his face hidden by a Palestinian scarf – holding a gun with what appeared to be a suicide vest strapped to his chest.\nHe was standing next to a drawing of the Palestinian flag and the words “the door will be opened for Gaza” painted on the wall in red.\nYavuz said the man was carrying two guns and appeared to have explosives strapped to his chest, adding that “we had to evaluate every possibility”.\nPolice officers block the street outside the Procter & Gamble facility near Istanbul – OZAN KOSE/AFP via Getty Images\nDistressed relatives of the hostages who had gathered at the cordoned-off facility broke into applause when informed about their loved ones’ release by local officials.\n“We are very happy after the tense long hours of waiting,” said Fatma Dursun, whose nephew was taken hostage.\n“Thank God they are all safe and sound,” she said.\nP&G’s head office in Cincinnati confirmed the incident. A spokesperson said: “The safety of P&G people and our partners is our top priority. Earlier today, we evacuated our Gebze facility and are working with local authorities to resolve an urgent security situation.”\nThe P&G factory in the Gebze District in Kocaeli – OZAN KOSE/AFP via Getty Images\nP&G Turkey employs 700 people at three sites across Istanbul and Kocaeli, according to the company’s website. It produces cleaning and hygiene brands such as Ariel washing powder and Oral B toothpaste.\nPublic feeling against Israel and its main ally the US has risen in Turkey since the conflict began, with regular protests in support of the Palestinian people in major cities and calls for an immediate ceasefire.\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, has been particularly outspoken, referring to Israeli “war crimes” and comparing Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s prime minister, to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.\nThe US Embassy in Ankara issued a warning in November about demonstrations that are “critical of US foreign policy” and call for boycotts of US businesses. The advice followed protests and attacks on outlets such as McDonald’s and Starbucks over the conflict in Gaza.\n%n\nDiscover Telegraph Wine Cellar’s new wine club.

    "text": "While consoling the family of Spc. Kennedy Sanders, one of the U.S. service members killed by a drone strike in Jordan, President Biden revisited an old story he likes to tell about his son Beau who died of brain cancer.\nBiden told Sanders’ parents that their 24-year-old daughter Kennedy would be promoted to Sergeant posthumously.\n“Oh well, I tell you what, it means a lot, a lot to me,” Biden said about honoring Sanders in a video clip from ABC’s Good Morning America posted on Twitter by Curtis Houck, Managing Editor of NewsBusters.\n“My son spent a year in Iraq, that’s how I lost him,” Biden continued. “1% of all these kids are the ones who take care of 99% of us.”\nBiden’s late son, Beau, passed away in May 2015 from glioblastoma, the New York Post (NYP)\nreported. Beau previously served a tour in Iraq that ended in 2009, the outlet reported.\nPresident Biden claims the burn pits in Iraq are what made Beau sick.\nWatch the clip below:\nOf course Biden called one of the three families who lost their child in the Iran-backed drone attack annnnd he made it all about Beau, claiming he's been in their exact same position.\nThe nerve of this guy….\n[pic.twitter.com/ddBDWtOwkI]\n— Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck)\n[February 1, 2024]",

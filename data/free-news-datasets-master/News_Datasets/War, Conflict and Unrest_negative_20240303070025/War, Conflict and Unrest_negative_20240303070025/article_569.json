    "text": "Washington, D.C. — Senator Ted Budd (R-NC) has joined a coalition letter led by Senators Pete Ricketts, Tim Scott (R-SC), and Jim Risch (R-ID) demanding, “an immediate and permanent prohibition” of U.S. aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The letter follows last week’s [revelation](https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/official-statements/serious-allegations-against-unrwa-staff-gaza-strip?__cf_chl_tk=r7Lq2X84fnMsHrH1XCooxXWcigq4MzphsvvNDoZMqMQ-1706282249-0-gaNycGzNDjs) that 12 UNRWA staff were directly involved in the October 7th attack on Israel and reporting that [uncovered](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/at-least-12-u-n-agency-employees-involved-in-oct-7-attacks-intelligence-reports-say-a7de8f36) that around 10% of UNRWA’s staff have ties to Islamic militant groups. The letter was co-signed by a total of 24 Senators including Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), John Barrasso (R-WY), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), John Hoeven (R-ND), Steve Daines (R-MT), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Mike Braun (R-ID), Deb Fischer (R-NE), John Cornyn (R-TX), Katie Boyd Britt (R-AL), Eric Schmitt (R-MO), John Kennedy (R-LA), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Susan Collins (R-ME). Letter highlights: “Let us be crystal clear: last week’s revelation that UNRWA staff members played a part in the October 7 attacks is not an example of a few bad apples acting out of turn. Instead, it is emblematic of an organization where no investigation or subsequent corrective measures will ever be enough to cure the rot that is so clearly endemic to its mission.” “The United States must permanently stop all contributions to UNRWA. Senate Republicans have introduced several bills this Congress to do just that, including the UNRWA Accountability and Transparency Act. As we consider ways to provide necessary assistance to Israel in its fight against Hamas terrorists, we request that any supplemental package include an immediate and permanent prohibition against U.S. contributions to UNRWA.” Read the full letter [HERE](https://www.ricketts.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-01-31-UNRWA-Letter.pdf). ###",

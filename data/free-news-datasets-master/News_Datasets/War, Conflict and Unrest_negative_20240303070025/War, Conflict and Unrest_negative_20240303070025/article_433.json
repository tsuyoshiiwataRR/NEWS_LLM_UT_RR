    "text": "By Michael Katz | Thursday, 01 February 2024 03:52 PM EST China analyst and author Gordon Chang told Newsmax on Thursday the U.S. has left itself open to getting hacked by China, and he also warned about the rising number of Chinese males of military age entering the U.S. through the southern border. \"We've known of these threats to critical infrastructure for decades, and we've done nothing or very little about it,\" Chang told \"Newsline\" and guest host Jenn Pellegrino. \"There have been attempts to talk to China about cyberattacks but when President Biden met [Chinese President] Xi Jinping in November at San Francisco, Biden didn't raise this issue. We have seen Republicans, Democrats, liberals, and conservatives have not taken the steps that are necessary to defend our networks. We have left ourselves open.\" Chinese citizens are now the fourth-largest group to traverse the Darien Gap, the only land route to the U.S. from South America, The New York Times reported. Customs and Border Protection data shows there have been a total of 15,038 encounters with Chinese nationals at the southern border in the 2024 fiscal year, which began in October, the vast majority being single adults. If that trend continues, there will be more than 60,000 encounters for the full fiscal year, toppling the record of 24,314 set in fiscal year 2023. The 2023 total was an increase of 1,018% over 2022's total (2,176) and 5,303% over 2021 (450). It is unknown how many Chinese nationals have entered the U.S. undetected. \"If we go back three years or so ago, the Chinese who were coming across our southern borders were primarily family groups,\" Chang said. \"That really reflected desperation on the part of the Chinese people. But recently, the composition of Chinese nationals coming into our country has changed because now we're seeing packs of Chinese males … traveling without family members pretending not to speak English of military age. U.S. Border Patrol knows that some of them are Chinese military.\" Chang said it is grave because China has been establishing secret police stations across the U.S. and could possibly have more biological weapons labs like the one reportedly found in Reedley, California, which had strains of several deadly viruses, such as Ebola, and what Chang said were 1,000 mice \"genetically engineered to spread disease.\" \"We have to assume that those males are coming into our country to kill Americans, to blow up power stations, poison reservoirs, start wildfires … cause panic in our country,\" Chang said. \"There's no question what's going on, and the thing that is just incomprehensible is that the Biden administration is not tracking these individuals, doesn't think that this is a big concern. \"It's not just the Chinese. We are seeing very, very suspicious elements coming in from Venezuela, Iran, and Syria in addition to China.\" About NEWSMAX TV: NEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America!

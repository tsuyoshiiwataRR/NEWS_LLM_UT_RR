    "text": "3 fallen Georgia soldiers honored locally after ‘tragic’ loss AUGUSTA, Ga. (WRDW/WAGT) - A vigil was held in Augusta for three Army reservists from Georgia who were [killed Sunday in Jordan.](https://www.wrdw.com/2024/01/30/biden-speaks-families-us-troops-killed-jordan-will-attend-dignified-transfer-remains/) Specialist Breonna Moffette from Savannah, Specialist Kennedy Ladon from Waycross and Sergeant William Rivers from Carrolton were killed in a drone attack. One of our local veterans gave his reaction to the news. “It was the Reverand’s idea, but I thought it was appropriate at a time like this. It was so tragic those young people long their lives,” said Arthur Smith. CSRA members gathered to honor the soldiers at The Miles Memorial in Augusta. Reverend Larry Fryer said: “We have this freedom that many of us do not have where many of us are dying from bombs. They don’t have the luxury and the freedom. We are to be able to come together without wearing or dodging bullets.” Sometimes we take freedom for granted, that’s why they say it’s important to honor the fallen. Loretta Hairston, a veteran, said: “Come out here and just think about that could have been my family, close family members. To be here, it’s an honor from one bed to the other unfortunately, the way it happened, we don’t like to see it with someone close to us.” So they gathered to pray for peace and for the numerous lives lost. Veteran Tyrone Hall said: “Having a service like this, it’s an honor for me to, you know, to be a part of it, to participate. The numbers are few, but you know, the heart is in it.” The service was small, but it was a chance for the military community to honor their fellow soldiers. Marguerite McKinney’s family has a military background. She came from Atlanta just for the service. “I just felt really led to come here and pray with the community and to grieve along with them. As a nation, I know that we’re all grieving. And it is just a terrible, terrible thing that has happened to our nation,” she said. Because there is no distance too far to honor those who paid the ultimate price. Hairston said: “The only thing we could do was just keep them in our prayers here in Augusta.” There also was a ceremony in Savannah for Moffette as well. Her father talked about how determined she was to get things done. “She loved getting things done. She knows how to push you to get things done. I mean, she’s not going to wait for you if you’re dragging your feet. She pushed me, she pushed us,” said her father. President Joe Biden honored the soldiers during the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday morning in Washington. Biden said he and the first lady will be at Dover Air Force Base on Friday as the service members’ bodies are brought back home to be buried. Copyright 2024 WRDW/WAGT. All rights reserved.",

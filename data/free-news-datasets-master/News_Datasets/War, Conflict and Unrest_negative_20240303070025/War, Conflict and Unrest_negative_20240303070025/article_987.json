    "text": "UN human rights chief Volker Türk expressed his shock on Thursday at credible reports alleging that Malian armed forces and foreign military personnel executed at least 25 people last week.\nFILE - UN peacekeepers from Tanzania serving under MONUSCO in the DRC speak to women after delivering medical and food supplies at Mbau hospital in Beni, North Kivu province. UN/George Musubao The alleged massacre happened in Welingara village in the Nara region of central Mali on 26 January. Some 30 civilians were also reportedly killed by unidentified gunmen in the Bandiagara region at the weekend.\nIn his call for impartial investigations into the allegations, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights emphasized the need for justice in accordance with international standards.\n'Agents and allies' Mr. Türk also urged the Malian authorities to ensure that their troops – \"as well as their agents or allies\" – adhered to human rights law and international humanitarian law, particularly regarding the protection of civilians.",

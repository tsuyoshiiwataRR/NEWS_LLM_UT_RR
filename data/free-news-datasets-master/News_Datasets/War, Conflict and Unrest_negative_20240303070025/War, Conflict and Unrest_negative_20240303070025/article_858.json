    "text": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said it's time to further disable Iran-backed militias that have struck at US forces and ships in the Middle East and the US is preparing to take significant action in response to the deaths of three US service members in Jordan.\nFor days the US has hinted strikes are imminent. While the threat of retaliation for the deaths has driven some militant groups to say they were stopping hostilities, Yemen's Houthi rebels were still attacking vessels.\n\"At this point, it's time to take away even more capability than we've taken in the past,\" Austin said this morning in his first press conference since he was hospitalised on January 1 due to complications from prostate cancer treatment.\nPrevious US strikes have not deterred the attacks.\nSince the war between Israel and Hamas broke out in October, Iranian-backed militant groups have struck US bases in Iraq and Syria at least 166 times with rockets, missiles and one-way attack drones, drawing about a half-dozen US counter-strikes on militant facilities in both countries. The US military also has carried out airstrikes targeting the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nThe US has attributed the attack on Tower 22 in Jordan to the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias that includes the militant group Kataib Hezbollah.\nWhile Iran has denied involvement, Austin said that \"how much Iran knew or didn't know, we don't know. But it really doesn't matter because Iran sponsors these groups\".\nAustin said \"without that facilitation, these kinds of things don't happen\".\n'They have capacity... I have more' He said the Pentagon is still looking at the forensics of the drone that struck Tower 22, a secretive base in northeastern Jordan that's been crucial to the American presence in neighbouring Syria.\n\"I don't think the adversaries are of a 'one and done' mindset. And so they have a lot of capability. I have a lot more,\" Austin said.\n\"We're going to do what's necessary to protect our troops.\"\nIn the Red Sea, the Houthis have fired on commercial and military ships almost 40 times since November.\nThe Houthis say they are targeting ships over Israel's offensive in Gaza against Hamas. But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperilling shipping in a key route for global trade between Asia, the Mideast and Europe.",

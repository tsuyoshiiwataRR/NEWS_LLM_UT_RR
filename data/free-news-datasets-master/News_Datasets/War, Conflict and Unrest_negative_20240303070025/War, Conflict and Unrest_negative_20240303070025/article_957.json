    "text": "by Sputnik Africa This is what the vice-president of the Defense and Security Committee of the Transition Council in Mali told Sputnik Africa. «We could not stay in a non-sovereign organization that is ECOWAS“, said Fousseynou Ouattara. Indeed, after the expulsion of the French ambassador from Mali, Paris went through ECOWAS heads of state to put pressure first on Bamako, then on Ouagadougou and Niamey, he explained. According to him, France is reducing its workforce in Ivory Coast, Senegal and Gabon because “France's economy is collapsing». «France no longer has the means to maintain its troops who are outside French territory. France is no longer a great power. I think that France is joining even its former colonies in the same rank», concluded the Malian official. As French influence fades on the continent, African heads of state and ministers are turning their eyes towards Russia. The cause is a very different attitude on the part of the Russian side, said the Malian politician. «All eyes are on Russia, because cooperation with Russia is a very clean, very transparent, equal-to-equal cooperation. Russia (…) does not know how to impose its needs on Africa at all. Russia is (…) in a very frank partnership. This is a partnership that we could not find with France». source: [Sputnik Africa](https://fr.sputniknews.africa/20240131/la-france-ordonnait-a-la-cedeao-de-prendre-des-sanctions-inhumaines-et-illegitimes-1064857938.html)",

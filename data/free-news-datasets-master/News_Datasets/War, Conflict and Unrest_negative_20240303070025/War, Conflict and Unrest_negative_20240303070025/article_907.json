Any sell-off “could prove short-lived.”\nSeparately, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries reduced daily oil production by 490,000 barrels last month, as the group and its allies embarked on a new effort to prevent a global surplus and shore up prices, according to a Bloomberg survey.\nTo get Bloomberg’s Energy Daily newsletter into your inbox, click here.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nA Brutal Crime Crackdown Is Emboldening Leaders Across Latin America\nElon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday\nChinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters\nAI Is Helping Pick What You’ll Wear in Two Years\nAI Can Speed Drug Discovery.

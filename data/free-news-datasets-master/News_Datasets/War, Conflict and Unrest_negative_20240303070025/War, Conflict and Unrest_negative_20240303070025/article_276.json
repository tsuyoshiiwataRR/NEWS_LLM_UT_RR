    "text": "Ukrainian authorities have announced that they have sunk a Russian military missile boat in the Russian-controlled southern Crimea, and as the war situation in the east reaches a standstill, Ukraine appears to be increasing its attacks on the Crimea area. The Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced on the 1st that it had sunk the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet missile boat ``Ivanovets'' in western Crimea. The footage released shows a boat, believed to be a Ukrainian unmanned boat, meandering toward the ship, and an explosion on the water that leaves a large hole in the side of the ship. The previous day, a Ukrainian missile flew over Crimea and the Black Sea, and the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that it had been intercepted.With the war situation in the east reaching a stalemate, the Ukrainian side appears to be intensifying its attacks on the area around Crimea. Masu. Meanwhile, the Russian Federal Investigative Committee announced on the 1st that DNA tests have confirmed the remains of 65 Ukrainian soldiers and others who were said to have been on board the Russian military transport plane that crashed on the 24th of last month in western Russia. Furthermore, the transport plane also released an image of a part with the word \"Patriot\" on it, which the Ukrainian military said was shot down by the Patriot surface-to-air missile system provided by the United States, and was recovered at the scene. Russia appears to be trying to use the crash of the transport plane as an excuse to destabilize countries supporting Ukraine, and the Russian Duma passed a resolution on the 1st calling on the U.S. Congress to end aid to Ukraine. doing.",

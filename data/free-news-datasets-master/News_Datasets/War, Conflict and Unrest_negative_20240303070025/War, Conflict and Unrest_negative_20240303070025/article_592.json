    "text": "A new video appears to show a U.S. military member guarding a room of illegal immigrants released by President Joe Biden’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The [video](https://youtu.be/m35rEy7c-64) of the migrants at the airport in Atlanta, which was first [obtained](https://dailycaller.com/2024/01/31/exclusive-video-appears-to-show-migrants-tucked-away-in-hidden-room-under-military-guard-at-major-us-airport/) by The Daily Caller, was recorded Tuesday by Republican state Sen. Colton Moore. Moore told The Daily Caller that he was notified by a “whistleblower” at the airport regarding the hidden room of illegal immigrants and that the whistleblower had observed an increase in illegal immigrants passing through the airport over the past several months. The video allegedly shows a U.S. service member guarding the entrance of the room, which was filled with illegal immigrants and “Team Libertad” volunteers. Team Libertad is a [volunteer program](https://www.facebook.com/teamlibertadatl) that provides illegal immigrants with assistance at the Atlanta airport. “We’re all getting them flights to where they need to be,” a Team Libertad volunteer can be heard saying in the video. “These are just recently documented travelers getting released from ICE getting to where they need to be.” The volunteer added, “There’s people that, they get dropped off here from ICE detention with no help.” [READ MORE: Pic: Illegal immigrants can fly without ID under Biden admin: Reports](https://americanmilitarynews.com/2024/01/pic-illegal-immigrants-can-fly-without-id-under-biden-admin-reports/) The Daily Caller reported that the affiliation of the alleged military member in the video has not yet been revealed; however, a Georgia National Guard spokesperson said they were “not aware of the incident in question or any such activity involving the Georgia National Guard at the airport.” Moore told The Daily Caller that the man dressed in a military uniform took his phone as he was recording evidence of the illegal immigrant room at the airport. Toward the end of the video, voices can be heard shouting “no” and “you’re done” at Moore while he was attempting to record illegal immigrants at the airport. “The room was absolutely packed with people from every continent on this planet,” Moore told The Daily Caller. “When I took my phone and reached it up above the guy to get a better view of all the illegals in the room, that’s when chaos broke out. That’s when the U.S. Army guy took the phone. It was a scrimmage between he and I in order to get the phone back. And then he proceeded to tell me to get out of there and just made a real big scene out of it.”",

    "text": "“Any coercive measure that restricts the market of one of the member countries of the region affects others,” said the permanent secretary of the Latin American and Caribbean Economic System (SELA), Clarems Endara. He added that “we are now less integrated than before, we exchange much less than we did before. Of everything that is traded in the region, only 15% is made by the region itself. Imagine if with that figure a blockade was carried out on several members.” He also analyzed that the unilateral coercive measures (MCU), applied by the United States government to Venezuela, “does not only affect the region, it affects the inputs and productivity of that country that is being subject to the sanction and the partners that \"They were in charge of making the exchange, it is a challenge to the region itself.\" He also referred to the practice of a global economy and its free nature: “We should respond with coordination to achieve greater efficiency in this latitude to produce those products that are being replaced by imports. In the region we have quite advanced technology mechanisms.”",

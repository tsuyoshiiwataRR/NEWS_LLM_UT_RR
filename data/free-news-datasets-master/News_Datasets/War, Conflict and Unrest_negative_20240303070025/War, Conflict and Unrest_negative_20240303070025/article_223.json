    "text": "Access restored at Port of Vancouver after blockade by protesters for Gaza\nPosted Feb 1, 2024 03:13:01 PM.\nLast Updated Feb 1, 2024 05:32:07 PM.\nVANCOUVER — Access to the Port of Vancouver has been restored after dozens of protesters with Palestinian flags and banners set up blockades at two entry points this morning.\nAn email from senior communications adviser Alex Munro says protesters at both the Clark Drive and Commissioner Street entrances have “moved on.”\nHe says access to the port has been “fully restored.”\nA statement issued by protesters says they were calling on the Canadian government to immediately enact an arms embargo on Israel.\nTraffic camera photos on the City of Vancouver website earlier showed semi-trucks waiting in a line near the port’s entrance, but updated images around 12:30 p.m. show the intersection cleared and traffic flowing.\nThe Vancouver port is Canada’s largest, facilitating trade of about $305 billion in goods annually and generating $11.9 billion in annual Gross Domestic Product.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 1, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press",

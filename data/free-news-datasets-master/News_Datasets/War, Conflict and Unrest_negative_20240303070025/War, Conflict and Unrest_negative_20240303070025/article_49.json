    "text": "MOSCOW, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- Fragments of the MIM-104A anti-aircraft guided missile of the U.S. Patriot air defense system were detected at the crash site of the Il-76 transport aircraft, Russian investigators said in a statement Thursday.\n\"According to the conclusions made during the investigation, fragments seized from the crash site... are design elements of the MIM-104A anti-aircraft guided missile of the U.S. Patriot complex,\" the investigative committee said in a Telegram post.\nA total of 116 fragments of two anti-aircraft missiles with inscriptions in English were found near the crash site of the plane, it said.\nThe probe also discovered at the crash site body fragments and some partially preserved personal documents.\nGenetic tests have confirmed that the body fragments belonged to the 65 Ukrainian military personnel, six crew members, and three military police officers who died as a result of the crash.\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Moscow has openly called for an international investigation into the incident. However, the West seems to be disinterested.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry confirmed on Jan. 24 that Ukraine had launched two missiles at a Russian Il-76 military transport aircraft, killing all 74 people on board. â– ",

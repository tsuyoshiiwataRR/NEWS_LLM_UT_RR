    "text": "by mike whitney «It is no coincidence that the attacks on UNRWA took place after the ICJ ruling. Israel is trying to discredit the International Court of Justice, and one way to do this is to denigrate the UNWRA. But the UNWRA has played a heroic role in providing health, education and other services to Palestinian refugees since 1948. It is truly heartbreaking that Israeli propaganda now demonizes the UNWRA and leads some countries to cut off their aid. My sympathy and support therefore go entirely to the UNWRA, and I hope that it can continue for a long time to play the vital role it has always played in supporting the Palestinian victims of Israeli aggression.'. ( [Avi Shlaim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cQ7b03ggCI), Israeli historian, YouTube) UNRWA ensures the distribution of food and flour to all of Gaza's 2,2 million inhabitants. Defunding UNRWA will lead to mass starvation and death. Here is your Zionist quiz of the day: Why did Israel launch a veritable media blitz on a United Nations relief agency (UNRWA) on the same day that the International Criminal Court (ICC) delivered its historic judgment on the genocide? - To distract from the fact that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza - Inform the public that new information has come to light regarding Hamas' involvement in the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). - Assuring citizens around the world that Israel's primary concern is the fight against terrorism. - activate the final phase of their ethnic cleansing operation. If you answered “4,” pat yourself on the back because that’s the correct answer. Of course, it is also true that Israel wanted to distract from the ICJ's announcement, but that pales in comparison to launching the final phase of its ethnic cleansing operation. This is the real coup de grace, the final blow to the two-state solution and a practical remedy to Israel's nagging demographic problem. It is also the essential piece of the puzzle that makes sense of the past 100-plus days of relentless bombings, airstrikes and other forms of state terror. It is as if Israel is boldly laying down its cards so that the whole world can see the strategy it intends to employ to eradicate the indigenous population and realize the Zionist dream of a Jewish state from the river to the sea. And what could this strategy be? Disperse 2 million Palestinians around the world through massive immigration. But how will they do it? After all, haven't a number of countries already refused to welcome Palestinians? Indeed, they did, but that was before photos (soon to be released) of starving women and children flooded social media sites around the world, sparking an unprecedented outpouring of sympathy for the besieged population. And as public sympathy leads to widespread outrage, more and more people will demand that their governments take action to alleviate suffering through mass immigration. This is how Israel intends to get rid of its indigenous population and create Zionist Valhalla, a Jewish majority in perpetuity. This is why Israel launched its ferocious attack on the UNWRA, because the UNWRA – more than any other humanitarian organization operating in the Middle East – helps feed and house the Palestinians, which goes against the Israel's explicit intentions. The last thing Israel wants is for the Palestinians to establish a huge refugee camp near Rafah, which will continue to grow in size in the years to come. This phenomenon has already occurred in Jordan and Lebanon, where nearly 3 million Palestinians still languish in refugee camps (75 years after the establishment of the Israeli state) and are still determined to return home one day or the other. This is not what Israel wants. Israel wants the Palestinians to “vanish into thin air,” which is why it wants them scattered all over the world so that the very idea of returning home will never cross their minds. Thus, although Israeli leaders are not happy about the reputational damage caused by their treatment of the Palestinians, they are willing to endure it in order to achieve their broader strategic goals, namely the complete eradication of Arab population and the strengthening of a permanent Jewish majority. Israel's overall strategy was best summed up by Daniella Weiss, a former mayor of a West Bank settlement, who said the following in a brief interview on TikTok: «They will move. They will move. The Arabs will move... So we don't give them food, we don't give the Arabs anything, and they will have to leave. The world will accept them'.

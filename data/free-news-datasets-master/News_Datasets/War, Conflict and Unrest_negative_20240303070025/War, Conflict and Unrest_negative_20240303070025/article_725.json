    "text": "President Biden of the United States has signed an executive order that allows sanctions to be imposed on those responsible for a series of violence committed by extremist Jewish settlers in the West Bank of Palestine. According to OCHA (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs), since military conflict between Israel and the Islamic group Hamas began in the Gaza Strip last October, violence against Palestinians by Jewish settlers has increased in the West Bank as well. . In response, President Biden issued an executive order on the 1st that would allow sanctions to be imposed on those involved in acts of violence, stating that ``violence, forced displacement, and destruction by extremist settlers has reached intolerable levels.'' I signed it. If you are subject to sanctions, your assets in the United States will be frozen and you will not be able to do business with Americans. Following the signing of the presidential order, the U.S. State Department announced sanctions against four people allegedly involved in attacks on residents and arson of buildings in the West Bank. Last December, the US government restricted the issuance of visas to people involved in acts of violence, and this time it has further strengthened its response. President Biden has previously criticized violence committed by Jewish settlers and has expressed his concerns directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",

    "text": "Germany is considering banning Austrian far-right extremist Martin Sellner from entering the country. Such a move is not unprecedented, but the legal hurdles are high in the EU.\nThere are moves to ban Austrian far-right extremist Martin Sellner from entering Germany\nAustrian far-right extremist Martin Sellner spent the day on Monday taunting leading German politicians as he defied a mooted plan to ban him from German soil. Live-streaming his two-hour journey in a rented car to the German border, the leader of Austria’s Identitarian group posted regular videos to social media after vowing to drink a coffee in the Bavarian town of Passau, just across the border.\nThe stunt, cheered on by a handful of supporters on the roadside, culminated in a brief encounter with the German police, who let him pass into Bavaria. He promptly filmed another video, in which he sarcastically thanked German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser and Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nThe 35-year-old Sellner gained public attention earlier in January when it emerged that he was a key speaker in a gathering of far-right extremists in Potsdam last November, also attended by members of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), at which he presented a “masterplan” to forcibly “remigrate” foreigners from Germany — including German passport holders with an immigrant background.\nMartin Sellner documented his journey to Germany in a video\nA new flurry of interest in Sellner was sparked last week when the socialist Left Party’s anti-fascism spokesperson Martina Renner asked the government to confirm publicly whether it was considering banning Sellner from entering Germany. Interior Ministry officials confirmed to the Bundestag member that a ban was being considered. The city of Potsdam has since confirmed that its foreigners’ registration authorities was also assessing whether the gathering in the city constituted a “danger to safety and public order.”\nLegal means against fascism The potential ban was welcomed by politicians from all major parties. “In our well-defended democracy, we should fundamentally not tolerate any agitation against our constitutional order — especially not from foreign extremists like Martin Sellner,” Philipp Amthor, of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), told the dpa news agency.\nThe Left Party’s Martina Renner, who favors a ban, was undeterred by Sellner’s defiance this week. “The fact that he was nevertheless able to enter the country yesterday does not speak against such an examination, as this could result in a longer-term entry ban if the outcome is positive,” she told DW by email. “We must not leave any legal remedies unchecked and unused that make it more difficult for neo-Nazis and fascists to engage in political activity.”\nThe EU’s Freedom of Movement Act allows member states to deny people entry for reasons of “public order or security,” though it adds, “There must be a real and sufficiently serious threat to the public order, affecting the basic interests of society.”\nRenner believes that Sellner represents such a threat: “Participation in meetings on the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany to plan and implement millions of deportations of people from Germany violates these fundamental interests in a fundamental way,” she said.\nBut Stefan Martini, senior researcher in public law at Kiel University, is skeptical whether there are enough grounds to ban Sellner from the country. “It would depend on how concrete these remigration plans are thought to have been,” he said. “Would this count as a call for subversion in Germany? If so, then a ban could be justified, but if they are thought to be just abstract scenarios that he described, then the entry of Mr Sellner probably wouldn’t be seen sufficiently dangerous.”\nSuspending freedom of movement in the EU Other countries have considered Sellner a threat in the past. The US and the UK have both denied Sellner entry in 2018 and 2019 respectively, after they learned that he had had direct contact with Brenton Tarrant, the Australian terroristwho murdered 51 Muslims in a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand in March 2019. Sellner’s organization, the Identitarians, had also received a donation from Tarrant.\nBut the EU has more stringent criteria — especially for EU citizens like Sellner, who enjoys freedom of movement rights. “Simply because of the European regulations, Germany is much stricter,” said Martini. “The individual must get a hearing, the reasons why a ban is imposed must be made clear – the legal restrictions on such a decision are much more stringent in Germany than in other countries.”\nAnd the criteria for imposing an entry ban are also relatively strict. “A fundamental interest of society needs to be threatened — such as the peaceful co-existence of people,” said Martini. “Even if the individual committed a crime in the past, you still have to examine whether a ban would be proportional.”\nNevertheless, bans on extremist agitators are not uncommon in the EU — though they are generally tied to concrete events. In 2020, Germany denied entry to Danish-Swedish politician Rasmus Paludan, after the anti-Islam activist had burned a copy of the Quran at a demonstration in Copenhagen. His group was planning a protest in the Neukölln district of Berlin, where many Muslims live.\nIn 2020, Germany denied entry to Danish-Swedish politician Rasmus Paludan\nSimilarly, in 2019, authorities in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia ensured that Russian extremist Denis Kapustin was denied entry to the entire Schengen area after he organized martial arts for neo-Nazi groups across Europe.\nMartini says that while in such cases the federal interior ministry usually carries out a risk assessment and then issues orders to the police, if no order from above exists, border control police can also use their own discretion.\n“In the case of Mr. Sellner, an interview was apparently also carried out at the border,” he told DW. “He was asked what purpose his stay in Germany had, and then they had to decide on the spot: Is there any threat to public safety in Germany?” If Sellner told them on Monday night, as he told his followers, that he was going for a coffee, the officials would have seen no grounds to refuse him entry.\nEdited by Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you’re here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

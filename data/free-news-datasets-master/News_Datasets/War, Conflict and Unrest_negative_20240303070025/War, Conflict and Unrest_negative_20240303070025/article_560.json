    "text": "China is preparing its legion of hackers to “wreak havoc” on critical US infrastructure, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned lawmakers Wednesday.\nDigital infiltrators working for the People’s Republic of China are specifically targeting American water treatment plants, the electrical grid, oil and natural gas pipelines and transportation systems, according to the FBI director, who noted that the Chinese hackers far outnumber the bureau’s cyber personnel.\n“China’s hackers are positioning on American infrastructure in preparation to wreak havoc and cause real world harm to American citizens and communities if and when China decides the time has come to strike,” Wray told the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.\n“To quantify what we’re up against, the PRC has a bigger hacking program than that of every major nation combined,” the FBI director said.\n“In fact, if you took every single one of the FBI cyber agents and intelligence analysts and focus them exclusively on the China threat, China’s hackers would still outnumber FBI cyber personnel by at least 50-to1.”\n3\nWray warned that the FBI’s cyber and intelligence analysts are outnumbered 50-to-1 by China’s hacking force.

Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) said he had no doubt that the PRC’s hacking program was laying the groundwork for the next major world conflict.\n“The difference here is that this has crossed the line from collecting on us and using cyber to get inside of our systems to putting malware in that can take out our systems,” Waltz said during an appearance on Fox News. “So, we have to start thinking about this differently.”\nWaltz further argued that cyberattacks against critical US infrastructure should be considered “an act of war.”\n“There is no difference in sending a missile into a dam or a water treatment facility than shutting it down through cyber means,” the Florida Republican said. “It’s an attack. It’s an act of war. We’ve got to begin thinking about it that way.”\nWray insisted that the US must remain vigilant and actively defend against threats from Beijing.\n“Otherwise, China has shown it will make us pay,” he said.",

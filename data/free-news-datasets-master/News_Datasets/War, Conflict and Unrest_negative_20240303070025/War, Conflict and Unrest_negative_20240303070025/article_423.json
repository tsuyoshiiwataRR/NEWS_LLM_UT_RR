    "text": "- Donald Trump has led Biden in four consecutive polls in the state\n- White House was asked if secrecy was a bid to avoid protesters\n- Biden visited black-owned business and union hall\nPresident Joe Biden snapped selfies in a black-owned sports bar and met union workers on a campaign trip to Michigan Thursday, but wasn’t able to escape controversy over the war in Gaza when he was accused of shielding his movements to avoid protesters.\nThe president grinned with customers at They Say, a sports bar where clients had their eye on NFL pre-Super Bowl hype and Iowa’s basketball star Caitlin Clark.\nIt was the spot the Biden-Harris campaign picked for a meeting with faith leaders, on a day when he also held an event at a UAW union hall in Warren, days after picking up the endorsement of the powerful union.\nHe was accompanied by UAW President Shawn Fain, who last week gave a rousing speech where he said Biden, who joined the union’s picket line during its strike, ‘earned’ the endorsement.\nThe White House said it was in ‘regular contact’ with Muslim and Arab leaders when asked why Biden didn’t meet with Arab American groups on his visit to Michigan. He visited a Black-owned bar and a union hall\nThe details on the locations he would visit were kept under wraps on the president’s official schedule, which prompted questions to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre about whether the secrecy was a plan to avoid protesters.\nKhalid Turaani, whose group ‘Abandon Biden Campaign’ is demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, complained about being in the dark about the location of Biden’s events.\n‘I believe Biden has failed his constituents on such a monumental scale that he is afraid to meet with them in a public forum,’ he said, told the Detroit News. Either way, the optics for him are embarrassing.’\n‘Why not have a meaningful conversation for how you change course with a community that has first-hand accounts of what it’s like to live in the countries where your decision-making is unfolding?’ said Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud.\nBiden was accused of keeping his movements under wraps to avoid protests like the kind that have dogged him at fundraisers and political events during Israel’s war on Hamas\nHis city contains one of the nation’s largest Arab American communities in the nation, amid the prospect that Biden’s support of Israel with its war on Hamas in Gaza could cost him political support in the state.\nMichigan was part of Biden’s ‘Blue Wall’ in 2020. Donald Trump carried it in 2016.\nAsked if Biden would meet with Arab American or Muslim leaders on the visit, Jean-Pierre responded: ‘The President has met with Americans with varying opinions about the conflict between Israel and Hamas’ and said White House officials were in ‘regular contact with Muslim and Arab American leaders in Michigan across the country.’\nShe said administration officials will travel to Michigan in February to ‘hear directly from community leaders on a range of issues that are important to them and their families, including the conflict of Israel and Gaza.’\nPolls show Biden’s support dipping among younger voters amid disapproval for his handling of Israel’s war in Gaza.\nHe signed an executive order Thursday that allowed for new financial sanctions on Israelis settlers who have gone after Palestinian civilians in the West Bank.\nAt the union hall, Biden touted his economic agenda. ‘To me it’s a basic, basic thing, and I mean this sincerely. Wall Street didn’t build the middle class. Labor built the middle class, and the middle class built the country,’ he said.\n‘We’re going to fight like hell and we’re going to ensure Joe Biden is the next president,’ Fain said.\nDonald Trump has led Biden in four consecutive polls in the state.\n***\nRead more at DailyMail.co.uk",

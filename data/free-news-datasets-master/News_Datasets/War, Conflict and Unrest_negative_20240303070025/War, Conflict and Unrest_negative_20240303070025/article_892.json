    "text": "Israel-Gaza War Emerges as Deadliest for Journalists: CPJ\nBandit Unveils the HM6420 Hammermill Grinder: A New Standard in Grinding Applications\nThe Bandit team has unveiled its latest innovation, the HM6420 hammermill grinder. This powerful 40” capacity grinder is specifically designed for grinding applications that may encounter contaminants. Its unique features and robust construction promise to offer productivity and durability on an unparalleled scale.\nUnrivalled Performance\nAt the core of the HM6420 lies a formidable Caterpillar C32 engine, outputting an impressive 1,200 horsepower. The engine powers a 50” diameter x 66” wide hammermill, offering a spacious and efficient grinding area. The hammermill is encased in a heavy-duty 1.75″ drum skin, crafted from rolled plate to endure rigorous usage.\nSuperior Construction\nThe HM6420 showcases the strength of ultrasonically tested alloy steel in its main shaft, ensuring its structural integrity even under intense workloads. The grinder’s pockets are forged from high-strength A-514 steel, further enhancing the machine’s durability and resilience.\nInnovative Features\nThe new grinder is equipped with 20 carbide-infused hammer inserts, designed for superior grinding performance. It also introduces a patent-pending quick-change pocket system, allowing easy and swift hardware replacements. The heavy-duty slat-style infeed conveyor and large diameter feed wheel, both directly driven, ensure exceptional pulling power and downforce for efficient grinding of large material quantities.\nSophisticated Capabilities\nThe Bandit team has equipped the HM6420 with a proportional feed system, regulating feed rates for optimal grinding performance. It also offers a variety of screen sizes, allowing for the production of different end-product sizes. The impact detection system is another noteworthy feature that prevents damage from contaminants. The grinder also includes a 56” wide, height-adjustable discharge, adding versatility to various grinding scenarios.\nAfter a successful demonstration at the 2023 Con Expo show, the HM6420 is set to commence production in the first quarter of 2024, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of grinding applications.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/world/chitungwiza-municipality-launches-verification-process-for-land-stand-offer-letters-amid-fraud-concerns/",

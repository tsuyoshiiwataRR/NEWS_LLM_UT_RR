    "text": "Al Nassr thrashed Inter Miami 6-0 in a friendly encounter in Riyadh. The much-anticipated showdown between the teams of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi took an unexpected turn as Ronaldo's absence due to injury and Messi's late substitute appearance marked a dramatic twist. The match was dubbed 'The Last Dance' owing to the rivalry between the footballing maestros from their days with Barcelona and Real Madrid. But, the last dance could not take place as Al-Nassr’s manager Luis Castro ruled out Ronaldo, saying, \"We will not see [Messi vs Ronaldo].\" From the initial moments, Al Nassr's dominance was evident, with Brazilian Talisca stealing the spotlight with a mesmerising hat-trick. The Saudi Pro League side wasted no time, scoring three goals within the first 12 minutes, leaving Inter Miami struggling to find their footing. The opening goal came from Otavio, seizing an opportunity as Miami lost possession while attempting to play from the back. Talisca then capitalised on a defensive lapse, slotting in Al Nassr's second goal. Aymeric Laporte added to the spectacle with a remarkable long-range free-kick, catching Miami's goalkeeper off-guard. As Talisca secured his second from the penalty spot, and Mohammed Maran added a looping header, the gulf in class between the teams became glaringly apparent. The American side, clearly fatigued from an extensive pre-season tour, faltered against Al Nassr's relentless attack. The absence of Ronaldo on the pitch was felt by fans, yet Al Nassr's performance spoke volumes about their collective strength. Talisca completed his hat-trick with a celebration reminiscent of Ronaldo's trademark 'Siu,' emphasising the team's unity and spirit. Messi made a late entrance, gracing the pitch for the final seven minutes. Despite his limited role, the Argentine maestro added a touch of excitement for the audience. The contrast between the subdued Messi and the absent Ronaldo raised questions about their potential on-field clash. Al Nassr's triumph sets the stage for their clash with rivals Al-Hilal, promising an exhilarating continuation to their football saga. Messi and his team arrived in Saudi Arabia on Friday, receiving a warm welcome at the airport After Kamila Valieva's doping ban, ISU conducted a re-ranking of the team event from the Beijing Games and elevated US...

    "text": "Ex-Las Vegas Raider WR Henry Ruggs has reportedly been moved to the Nevada prison camp to serve his sentence after being found guilty of driving drunk at 156 mph and crashing into a car killing 23-year-old Tina Tintor and her dog. According to the report; [READ ALSO: Why NFL Star Tyreek Hill Reportedly Filed For Divorce From His Recently Married Wife Keeta Vacarro Revealed](https://blacksportsonline.com/2024/01/why-nfl-star-tyreek-hill-reportedly-filed-for-divorce-from-his-recently-married-wife-keeta-vacarro-revealed/) [Ruggs](https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/ex-las-vegas-raider-henry-ruggs-serving-sentence-at-nevada-prison-camp/) began his sentence at the High Desert State Prison northwest of Las Vegas, records showed. The prison, the largest in the department, is a 45-minute drive northwest of Las Vegas. Ruggs was incarcerated Tuesday at the Stewart Conservation Camp, a minimum security facility in Carson City. The majority of the inmates at the facility work for the Nevada Division of Forestry, the departmentâ€™s website said. It was unclear if Ruggs was doing that work while in custody at the dormitory-style facility. Ruggs, who was initially charged with DUI resulting in death, DUI resulting in bodily harm, two counts of reckless driving resulting in death or substantial bodily harm, and possession of a firearm while under the influence, accepted a plea deal last May. Henry Ruggs is up for parole in August 2026 and at this point, all we can say is to wish him good health as he serves his sentence at the Nevada prison camp.",

    "text": "Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhnyy in his article for [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/opinions/ukraine-army-chief-war-strategy-russia-valerii-zaluzhnyi/index.html?fbclid=IwAR3B_d9MEggxMAQJ39LmoGZEa6Hrlij2c5bs62tLQhsWM1ccFb7psNDLmm8) expressed his vision of important changes in the approaches to warfare and outlined three main goals on which to focus efforts in the war against Russian aggression. Whatever remarkable advances there have been in the fields of aviation, missile technology and space-based assets, for instance, the concept of victory remains unchanged: to destroy the enemy and to capture or liberate territory. \"And yet, each war is unique,\" he noted. \"And there is no greater challenge facing the military commander, in my opinion, than understanding – in good time – how each war is shaped differently. Firstly, by technological progress, which determines the development of weapons and equipment. And, secondly, by political conditions at home and abroad, and the economic environment,\" Zaluzhnyy argued. It is well known by now that a central driver of this war is the development of unmanned weapons systems. Crucially, it is these unmanned systems – such as drones – along with other types of advanced weapons, that provide the best way for Ukraine to avoid being drawn into a positional war, where we do not possess the advantage. But while mastery of such technologies is key, it is not the only factor influencing current strategy. We must contend with a reduction in military support from key allies, grappling with their own political tensions. Our partners’ stocks of missiles, air defense interceptors and ammunition for artillery is becoming exhausted, due to the intensity of hostilities in Ukraine, but also from a global shortage of propellant charges. Russia, taking note of how developments in the Middle East have distracted international attention, might seek to provoke further conflicts elsewhere. \"The weakness of the international sanctions’ regime means Russia, in partnership with certain others, is still able to deploy its military-industrial complex in pursuit of a war of attrition against us,\" Zaluzhnyy said. \"We must acknowledge the significant advantage enjoyed by the enemy in mobilizing human resources and how that compares with the inability of state institutions in Ukraine to improve the manpower levels of our armed forces without the use of unpopular measures.\" According to Zaluzhnyy, perhaps the number one priority here is mastery of an entire arsenal of (relatively) cheap, modern and highly effective, unmanned vehicles and other technological means. Already such assets allow commanders to monitor the situation on the battlefield in real time, day and night, and in all weather conditions. But not only that. They provide real-time intelligence allowing the adjustment of fire around the clock, without pause – giving us the ability to deliver high-precision strikes against enemy targets in forward positions and in depth. In short, this means nothing less than the wholesale redesign of battlefield operations – and the abandoning of outdated, stereotypical thinking. For the time being, the priority remains improving the situation on the battlefield. And here, technology boasts an undoubted superiority over tradition.",

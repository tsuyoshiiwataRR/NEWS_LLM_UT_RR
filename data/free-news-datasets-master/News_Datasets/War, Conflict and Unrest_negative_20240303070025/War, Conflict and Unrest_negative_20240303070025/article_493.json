    "text": "SAGINAW, Mich. (Gray News) - A Michigan police department sent out a final call to honor a trooper killed in the line of duty.\nThe Saginaw Police Department shared a video of Michigan State Trooper Joel Popp’s final call on Facebook Wednesday.\n“Your courage and sacrifice will never be forgotten,” the man delivering the message is heard saying. “This is the end of watch for our brother, Tpr. Joel Popp, badge number 1779. Rest in peace, sir. We’ll take it from here.”\nPopp, 39, died on Jan. 24 after he was hit by a car during a traffic stop on Interstate 75.\nAccording to Michigan State Police, he and other troopers were investigating a suspected impaired driver stopped in a curved lane of traffic when a vehicle struck two patrol cars and Popp, who was outside of his car at the time.\nHe was taken to Hurley Medical Center, where he was later pronounced dead.\nJoel Popp is pictured with his wife, Stephanie, and his daughter. Popp was killed on Jan. 24 after he was struck by a car during a traffic stop. (Stefanie Popp) Popp enlisted with the Michigan State Police in January 2020. He is survived by his wife Stephanie and young daughter.\nLoved ones and colleagues gathered for Popp’s funeral service on Wednesday at the Saginaw Valley State University, according to WNEM .\nLt. Kimberly Vetter with the Michigan State Police said dozens of law enforcement partners came together at the service to honor him.\n“We’re a family and it’s difficult to lose a family member,” Vetter told WNEM. “We spend a lot of time together, we train together, and work together.”\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered all flags to be lowered to half-staff on Thursday in acknowledgment of Popp’s service to the state.\nCopyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

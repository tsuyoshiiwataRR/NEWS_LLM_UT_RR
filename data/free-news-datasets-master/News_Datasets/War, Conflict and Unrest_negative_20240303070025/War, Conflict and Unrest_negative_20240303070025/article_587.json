    "text": "TOKYO -- The U.S. Air Force CV-22 Osprey transport aircraft that crashed off Yakushima Island in Kagoshima Prefecture in November 2023 was in fact one of six stationed at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo's western suburbs. Up to June that same year, the Mainichi Shimbun used a public flight tracking website to examine those Ospreys' flights over the Tokyo metropolitan area, and found the aircraft were routinely flying over densely populated areas in Tokyo plus Kanagawa Prefecture to the south. The U.S. military discloses very little about the specific activities of its Ospreys in Japan, meaning how they are specifically being used is generally unknown. Between September 2022 and June 2023, the Mainichi Shimbun used the website [ ADSBexchange.com](ADSBexchange.com), which provides the types as well as the positions of aircraft, to track and analyze about 50 flights by the Yokota base Ospreys. Some were cross-verified for accuracy using location information, including video taken by reporters. The investigation identified about 30 instances where Ospreys departing from Yokota flew in circles over the Tokyo area. The most frequent activity involved repeated loops around the base, possibly indicating takeoff and landing training, with some flights making more than five circles in a single sortie. Occasionally, the aircraft deviated westward and circled over Akiruno, Tokyo. The circular flights sometimes extended over a wide area, reaching around 80 kilometers from north to south -- from Hidaka, Saitama Prefecture to Miura, Kanagawa Prefecture -- and about 15 kilometers west to east -- from Yokota Air Base to Nishitokyo, Tokyo. The flights passed over urban areas including the western Tokyo municipalities of Mitaka and Chofu, and the Kanagawa Prefecture cities of Kawasaki, Yokohama and Kamakura. The Mainichi investigation also found that Ospreys routinely flew between Yokota and U.S. Naval Air Facility Atsugi in Kanagawa Prefecture, approximately 30 kilometers away, passing over residential areas of suburban Tokyo municipalities including Hachioji, Machida and Sagamihara. These flights continued even after sunset, with the investigative team confirming multiple flights around 9 p.m. Furthermore, there were numerous flights beyond the Tokyo area, including over Utsunomiya, Tochigi Prefecture, toward Japan's northeastern Tohoku region, and over Numazu, Shizuoka Prefecture, and the city of Kyoto, far to the west. The Osprey that crashed off Yakushima Island was reportedly flying from Yokota to Kadena Air Base in Okinawa Prefecture via Iwakuni Air Base in Yamaguchi Prefecture. The Ospreys currently stationed in Japan include six at Yokota Air Base and 24 Marine Corps Ospreys (MV-22) at Air Station Futenma in Okinawa. However, there have been 34 incidents involving the aircraft since they were first deployed in Japan in 2012, such as accidents and emergency landings. These include a serious crash in Nago, Okinawa Prefecture, in 2016. There have also been fatal Osprey accidents overseas, raising concerns of possible structural defects. In response to the Yakushima crash, the U.S. military grounded its entire fleet of close to 500 Ospreys. However, it stated that this was to conduct an investigation into the cause of the accident and ensure a safer resumption of flights, indicating it is very likely that Ospreys will get back in the air. The Mainichi Shimbun contacted the U.S. military regarding the purpose of Osprey flights in the Tokyo area and its future plans, but no response had been received as of the time of publication.

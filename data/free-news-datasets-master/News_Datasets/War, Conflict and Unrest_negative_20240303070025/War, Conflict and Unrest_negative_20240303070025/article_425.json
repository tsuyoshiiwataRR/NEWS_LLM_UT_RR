    "text": "7. As, the\nmedia, their Democrats, and desperate Republicans celebrated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis leaving the presidential race, some suggested ignorantly that it was the House of Mouse that did him in. Obviously, that was not true, and now DeSantis has beaten back a lawsuit alleging “retaliation” is the latest win over the media conglomerate.\n6. CNN’s Poppy Harlow tried to get NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to slam former President Donald Trump but the Stoltenberg was\nuninterested in playing this game and praised him instead. Noting that Trump’s gripe about NATO was all about how our allies were not paying their fair share and they pay more now, “worked with him for four years and I listened carefully because the main criticism has been about NATO allies spending too little on NATO and the message has been taken across the alliance in Europe and Canada.”\n5. Who wouldn’t want to let murderous Hamas killers into the United States after their decades of slaughter, and specifically the attacks on Israeli civilians on Oct. 7? Well, after a\n422-2 vote in the U.S. House of Representatives, two members actually voted against a bill banning these monsters and unsurprisingly they were members of “The Squad” – U.S. Reps. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).\n4. A big\nhttps://www.al.com/news/2024/01/freedom-from-religion-foundation-takes-credit-for-removing-bible-verse-on-alabama-schools-dugout.html for the terrible people at the Freedom from Religion Foundation (FFRF) as Mobile County Schools’ Theodore High School removed a “divisive” Bible verse (I Corinthians 10:31) that reads, “Whatever you do, do it for the Glory of GOD”. The idea that the FFRF is protecting children by doing this stuff is silly, they are attention seekers who send out e-mails from the office in Wisconsin, seeking attention, and hoping people will bend to their will, it is best to ignore them officially.\n3. A White House employee, Charlie Kraiger, a cybersecurity policy analyst and Foreign Affairs desk officer in the Executive Office at the White House, told conservative guerrilla journalist James O’Keefe that the Biden Administration is in\nchaos. The Biden Administration’s Kraiger told O’Keefe, whom he thought he was on a date with, that President Joe Biden is in clear mental decline, everyone hates Vice President Kamala Harris, Michelle Obama is not running, and that many people “think they need to get rid of [Biden] or [Harris].”\n2. The Business Council of Alabama (BCA) is making it pretty clear that they are ready to fully\nbattle the United Auto Workers union (UAW) to keep them out of the Mercedes plant to make sure “that we will not let the UAW do to Alabama what it did to Detroit.” While unions keep trying to gain a foothold deeper into the state of Alabama, there could be another unionization vote at the Amazon facility in Bessemer too. The BCA says the union is a threat to Alabama’s jobs and they could point to the latest UPS layoffs after their union secured big pay increases.\n1. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, backed by the Islamic Republic of Iran, is being\ncited as the group responsible for the attack on American soldiers in Jordan last week by the Biden Administration as it weighs a response that is sure to come soon. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says he believes Iran planned, resourced, and facilitated the attack while Iran said it will “decisively respond” to any attack on Iran, where a direct attack seems unlikely.\nListen here:\nDale Jackson is a thought leader for Yellowhammer News and hosts a talk show from 5-9 a.m. weekdays on WVNN, on Talk 99.5 from 10-11 a.m., and on Talk Radio 103.9 FM/730AM WUMP from noon to 1 p.m.\nDon’t miss out!\nSubscribe today to have Alabama’s leading headlines delivered to your inbox.",

    "text": "2024-02-01 21:13:33 Published on : The Malian opposition denounces an “illegitimate” and “without consultation” decision after Mali’s withdrawal from ECOWAS. A choice of the ruling junta which wanted to protest against the sanctions imposed by the regional body demanding a rapid return of civilians to power. Other countries such as Niger and Burkina Faso have also left the organization. The Senegalese National Assembly approved on Wednesday, during tense debates, the creation of a commission of inquiry targeting the Constitutional Council. The request for the creation of this commission was initiated by the coalition of Karim Wade, a personality disqualified from the next presidential election by the body. The coalition calls into question the integrity of two members of the Council. In Ivory Coast, during the CAN, beyond football, it is also an opportunity for players to convey strong messages. Some are committed to fighting against illegal migration. The phenomenon affects thousands of young Ivorians every year. Former internationals go on the field to meet the youth. 1706827849 #Withdrawal #Mali #ECOWAS #opposition #denounces #illegitimate #decision Related posts: Changing Attitudes Towards Air Conditioning in Europe: From Luxury to Necessity \"Convergence Partners Invests $10 Million in Fintech Group 42Markets for Growth and Expansion\" COLLECT UNEMPLOYMENT | The new requirement to meet France is now suffering from its lack of strategy to reduce public spending Qualcomm stock remains a long-term growth story, says 5-star analyst \"Before US sanctions, Huawei wasn't so well known for 5G\" The biggest collapse and the worst recession that the West may face...

    "text": "Judge orders suspect in Energy Park shooting, Bernardston home invasion, held without bail |Published: 02-01-2024 5:34 PM| GREENFIELD — A local man facing 15 charges stemming from an alleged shooting at Energy Park and a separate alleged home invasion in Bernardston will remain held without bail, a Franklin County Superior Court judge ruled on Thursday. Gabe Adams, 21, has been deemed too dangerous to release on bail since his arrest and Judge Karen Goodwin opted to keep him locked up as the legal process plays out. A dangerousness ruling allows for a defendant to remain held without bail for 180 days. Assistant District Attorney Joseph Webber, who is prosecuting the cases, said he is prepared for trial at anytime. “The defense can pick the trial date,” he told Goodwin on Wednesday afternoon. In relation to a shooting at Greenfield’s Energy Park in July 2022, Adams has pleaded not guilty to two counts of attempted assault and battery by discharge of a firearm, and single counts of assault and battery by discharging a firearm, discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a building, unlawful possession of a firearm without a license to carry, unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition without an FID card and tampering with evidence. In connection to an alleged home invasion in Bernardston two months prior, he has pleaded not guilty to home invasion, armed assault to rob, assault and battery, assault with a dangerous weapon, kidnapping, larceny from a building and intimidation of a witness. Adams had previously been arraigned in Greenfield District Court. His cases were transferred to Superior Court due to their severity. Defense attorney Nora Leovich argued that her client could safely be released on bail into the custody of his father and grandmother, who live in Colrain. Webber explained he unsuccessfully offered Adams a deal consisting of five to seven years in state prison in exchange for a guilty plea. He told Goodwin the home invasion involved Adams allegedly luring someone to a house under false pretenses, only to help assault that person and force them to drive back to their home to steal nicotine products and marijuana. According to Webber, Adams and others he was with then allegedly dropped the victim off on the side of a road in Greenfield and told them not to tell the police. Webber explained that two months later Adams was in Energy Park and allegedly shot a man in the foot following a verbal dispute. Adams allegedly ran from the scene, changed his clothes and tampered with evidence in an attempt to deceive authorities searching for him. Webber said a firearm was found in Adams’ backpack and a friend he was with at the time of the shooting corroborated eyewitnesses’ accounts. “I can’t emphasize enough how serious the commonwealth is taking this,” Webber told Goodwin. “It’s an overwhelmingly strong case against Gabe Adams.” Leovich said that as of Wednesday her client had been held without bail for 567 days. She also said the firearm in question was found in some brush, not a backpack. Leovich explained Adams was placed into the custody of his mother after his father was in a near-fatal car crash in 2005. However, she explained, his mother eventually lost custody and Adams was adopted by a social worker, which is why Adams has a different surname than his father. “He essentially grew up in the system, for one reason or another,” Leovich said, adding that Adams now “has a great deal of family support, and that’s important to him.” Reach Domenic Poli at: dpoli@recorder.com or 413-930-4120.",

    "text": "It has been almost four months since Hamas fighters entered Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7, 2023, overran military posts and attacked kibbutzes and the Nova music festival. Since then, Israeli investigators have been carrying out painstaking and, by their own admission, often difficult to endure detailed work documenting atrocities committed by the attackers, securing evidence and reconstructing what happened. “It’s about crimes against humanity,” said Police Chief Commissioner Mirit Ben Mayor, who has been involved in this task since the beginning, on Thursday at an event at the German Foreign Office in Berlin. She speaks of a “terrible massacre.” But one thing in particular became increasingly clear over the course of the investigation: “Sexual violence was systematically and carefully planned as part of the attack.” This has now been proven by numerous evidence. “When we started investigating, we didn’t know how terrible this massacre was,” says Mayor. She and the other investigators have evaluated around 100,000 photos and video recordings since the attack on October 7th, interviewed survivors and examined the bodies of the dead or what was left of them. There were around 300 deaths on the grounds of the Nova Music Festival alone, says Mayor. But it is less the high number than the atrocities committed by the attackers that shocks them. Many women’s corpses were naked, others only in their underwear, and many showed signs of brutal rape and other massive abuse, often in the genital area. Eyewitnesses reported a young woman who was shot in the head by a Hamas fighter while he was raping her. The total number of victims is still not completely clear. The Israeli authorities speak of around 1,140 people killed and initially around 250 abducted to the Gaza Strip. The website www.oct.7map.com, which is based on international media research, names more than 420 female and more than 800 male victims and abductees. The number of women killed is given here as at least 320. Shari Mendes is actually an architect. As a reservist, she is also responsible for identifying and burying killed Israeli soldiers. After the Hamas attack, she was also tasked with identifying civilians who had been killed. She reports to the Foreign Office about corpses of young women in their own houses on the kibbutz with terrible signs of torture and sexual abuse. The sight of them was difficult for her to bear. “They could have been our daughters,” she says through tears. The German Ambassador for Feminist Foreign Policy, Gesa Braut, invited. She points out that there are atrocities and sexual violence in many wars and conflicts, including in Ukraine, the Bosnian war and Sudan. On October 7th, however, “in its massive terrorist attack,” it was Hamas “that systematically used sexual violence as a weapon of war” – also to traumatize the entire Israeli society. The event in Berlin should help “everyone see this.” “Everyone and every death is a tragedy,” says US writer and women’s rights activist Sheryl Sandberg. This applies to the dead in Israel as well as to the people in the Gaza Strip who have since been killed by Israeli attacks. However, given the obvious evidence, Sandberg clearly contradicts Hamas’ claims that its fighters have nothing to do with rape. “We must not forget these crimes against humanity,” she warns. Sandberg misses more outrage about the actions worldwide, including at the United Nations and its women’s organization. info By clicking on the icon you can add the keyword to your topics. info By clicking on the icon you open your “my topics” page.

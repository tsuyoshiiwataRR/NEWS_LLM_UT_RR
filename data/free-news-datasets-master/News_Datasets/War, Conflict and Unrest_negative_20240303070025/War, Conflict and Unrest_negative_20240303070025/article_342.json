    "text": "Drones and missiles work. Ukrainians stepped up their raids late last year, destroying—mostly with air-launched missiles—two landing ships, a submarine, corvette and decommissioned minesweeper.\nA December drone strike on the patrol boat Tarantul—not to be confused with the Tarantul-class Ivanovets—marked a turning point in this devastating anti-ship campaign. Tarantul was the first Russian warship to fall prey to Ukraine’s drone boats. Ivanovets was the second.\nIn 23 months of hard fighting, the Black Sea Fleet has lost: a cruiser; four large amphibious landing ships; a submarine; a supply ship; several patrol boats and small landing craft; and Ivanovets.\nThe crew of the Russian navy missile-corvette Ivanovets saw the drone boats coming early Thursday morning. They opened fire with machine guns or cannons—but missed.\nSeveral of the explosives-laden, satellite-guided boats struck the 490-ton Tarantul-class corvette—blowing her up then sinking her It’s possible all 50 or so sailors aboard the 1980s-vintage vessel are dead. At a minimum, the Russian Black Sea Fleet is down yet another warship.\nThe sinking coincides with repeated attacks on Russian oil infrastructure by Ukraine’s long-range unmanned aerial vehicles—and comes just two weeks after Ukrainian missiles shot down one of the Russian air force’s rare Beriev A-50 radar planes.\nUkrainian forces “are running rings around the Kremlin,” mused Ben Hodges, a retired U.S. Army general. “Russians seem unable to protect energy infrastructure, airplanes on the ground in Crimea, or their ships.”\nIvanovets’ destruction continues the Black Sea Fleet’s long losing streak against a Ukrainian fleet\nThe Ukrainians scuttled the frigate at her mooring in Odesa in the early hours of the initial Russian attack in February 2022.\nWith Hetman Sahaydachniy on the seafloor, the Ukrainian navy became a new kind of navy—one that fights with drones and missiles, with big assists from the air force and army.",

    "text": "Lawrence Jones tours Chicago as the migrant crisis continues\nA Chicago Democrat running for the Illinois House is calling out Mayor Brandon Johnson for allowing migrants to “invade” the Windy City.\n“Fox & Friends” co-host Lawrence Jones visited the sanctuary city to witness the crisis firsthand and walk the streets with candidate Andre Smith.\nSmith told Jones that the city’s schools, park districts and apartments have been used for placing migrants and displacing Chicago residents.\n“The money is coming from the hard-owned taxpayers, taxpayers’ dollars that don’t have the luxury now to go to the park in their community because migrants are there,” Smith said in the interview that aired Tuesday.\n“It’s an invasion.”\nABBOTT REAMS OUT ‘COLD-HEARTED’ BIDEN AS CHICAGO REBUFFS BUSES: ‘SEND THEM TO REHOBOTH’\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\nSmith showed Jones two shuttered buildings now sheltering migrants – an academy for young women and a health center that once serviced patients struggling financially. Smith said both were closed due to lack of funds.\n“You tell us that there’s no funding or the lack of funding. But then you bring migrants in and make them shelters. That’s not the American way,” Smith said.\n“They have the funding. And every now and then they say, ‘Hey, we found more millions, we found more money.’”\nA 91-year-old Chicago resident told Jones that Johnson “can’t handle” the challenges facing the city.\n“This job was not cut for him,” Collean Fuller said.\nJones added that he reached out to the mayor’s office for comment but did not hear back.\nJohnson said recently his office has “responded to this humanitarian mission with the full force of government,” before calling Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott “reckless” for sending migrant buses “all over the state of Illinois.”\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSmith previously told Fox News if elected he will pursue a recall of Johnson, who defeated fellow left-wing Mayor Lori Lightfoot last year.\nHe added that Chicago’s sanctuary status should be put up for a popular referendum by the city’s voters.\nFox News’ Charles Creitz contributed to this report.\nOriginal article source: Chicago Democrat goes off on city’s handling of migrant crisis: ‘It’s an invasion’",

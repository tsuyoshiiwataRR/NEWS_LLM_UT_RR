    "text": "The member of the Foreign Policy Commission, Sovereignty and Integration of the National Assembly (AN), deputy Roy Daza, warned that the Supreme Court of Justice gave a “definitive ruling” in relation to the request to lift disqualifications against those who requested it, in accordance with the provisions of the Barbados Agreement. No power in the world, neither the United States Congress nor the White House, is going to impose laws and decisions on our judiciary, much less on this parliament,” explained Daza. He was also emphatic in stating that Venezuela will ask the United States government and its Treasury Department to completely lift the sanctions \"against our country that represent a crime against humanity, and that Venezuela does not accept any type of blackmail.\" He asserted that the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Psuv) has ratified continuing with the dialogue because this constitutes a national interest and not a political partiality. “The dialogue has served as a group of political stability and those who today try to blow it up are because they are imbued with disrespect for the constitution and prefer to walk along paths contrary to legality,” he stated. Sanction to the humble For his part, the deputy for Democratic Action (AD), Luis Eduardo Martínez, said that the sanction applied against Venezuelan gold and the threat of doing the same with oil and gas, only harms the humble people. “If they reimpose the sanctions, the heads of the Government and the extremist opposition leaders will continue to eat full. Those who will suffer the most from its consequences are millions of humble Venezuelans who are on the margins of the conflict,” said the opposition leader. Martínez indicated that the same American congregation recognizes that the sanctions \"have not had a political effect.\"",

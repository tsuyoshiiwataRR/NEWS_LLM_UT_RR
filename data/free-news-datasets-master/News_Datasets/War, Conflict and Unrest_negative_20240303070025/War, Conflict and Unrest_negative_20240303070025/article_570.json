    "text": "A Ukrainian soldier is seen at a position in the Kherson region of Ukraine on November 2, 2023. An alleged group of Russian soldiers reportedly located at a field hospital in Kherson recorded a video in which they said they were left without medicine.\nA group of Russian soldiers wounded while fighting in Ukraine recently released a video in which they discussed being “dumped off” at a field hospital without necessary medication.\nThe clip was shared to X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday by WarTranslated, an independent media project that translates materials about the Russia-Ukraine war into English. Newsweek could not independently verify the video and contacted Russia’s Ministry of Defense via email for comment.\n“Here are the patients and how they’re treated in these conditions,” a soldier narrating the video said at the beginning of the clip, according to WarTranslated’s captions, while the camera panned around what appeared to be a basement dwelling with little supplies.\n“We’re not needed anywhere by anyone. They just dumped us,” the narrator continued. “I’ve been prescribed injections, pills…yet I’m just laid here and not given anything. We live worse than the f homeless.”\nAnton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, also posted the soldiers’ video on X on Thursday.\nIn his post, Gerashchenko indicated the servicemen were from Russia’s 144th Motorized Rifle Brigade and filmed their video from inside a field hospital in the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine’s Kherson region.\n“They say they were left to sleep on bare pallets…Many have been prescribed treatment but are not given any medication,” Gerashchenko wrote, in part.\nWarTranslated frequently posts videos of Russian soldiers airing their grievances with Russian President Vladimir Putin or Russia’s military leaders. In November, WarTranslated’s X account shared a video featuring a man who identified himself as a Russian soldier. He claimed Moscow’s military command ordered him to return to Ukraine, even though he had lost an eye while fighting in the war.\nThe media project also published a video earlier in November on X that allegedly showed naked Russian soldiers being forced to stay in a pit because they refused to fight. Similarly, WarTranslated posted a video in late June of a Storm-Z company from Russia’s military saying they would not return to what they called the “meat grinder” of the front lines.\nMeanwhile, fighting continues between invading Russian forces and Ukraine’s military in the Kherson region where the wounded soldiers were said to have recorded their video. Neither side reportedly made gains, while Kyiv said its military had thwarted “intensified” assaults from Russia’s infantry.\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW) in a Wednesday assessment wrote that “positional engagements continued in the east (left) bank” of Kherson near the village of Krynky.\nThe think tank reported that Colonel Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s Southern Southern Operational Command, reported Russian forces had “recently intensified infantry assaults in the east bank of Kherson Oblast and that 70 percent of Russian personnel sustained casualties in these assaults.”\n“Humenyuk stated that Russian forces on the east bank of the Dnieper River are attempting to increase their use of first-person view (FPV) drones up to 70 drones per day, but that Ukrainian forces can regularly down half of them with small arms fire and electronic warfare (EW) systems,” ISW added.\nRelated Articles\nStart your unlimited Newsweek trial",

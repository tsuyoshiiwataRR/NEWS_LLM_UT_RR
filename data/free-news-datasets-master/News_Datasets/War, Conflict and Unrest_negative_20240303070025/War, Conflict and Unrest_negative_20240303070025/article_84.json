    "text": "Israel\n‘Squad’ Democrats only votes against Bill to ban Hamas terrorists from entering the U.S.\nThere can be no explanation other than complete anti-American and anti-Israel liberalism behind two infamous ‘Squad’ members of congress voting to allow terrorists into the United States.\nThe “\nNo Immigration Benefits for Hamas Terrorists Act” thankfully passed the House by a 422-2-1 vote. According to C-SPAN the only two legislators to vote against the legislation, were Democratic Representatives Cori Bush or Missouri and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.\nThe bill will ban members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad involved in the October 7 attacks against Israel from entering the United States, reports the\nDaily Caller News Foundation.\nThe bill was introduced by Republican California Representative Tom McClintock, which would mandate that “any alien who carried out, participated in, planned, financed, afforded material support to, or otherwise facilitated any of the attacks against Israel initiated by Hamas beginning on October 7, 2023, is inadmissible” to the U.S., according to its text.\nDemocratic Representative Della Ramirez of Illinois was the only lawmaker to vote “present,” according to C-SPAN.\nPalestinian terrorists murdered approximately\n1,200 people on Oct. 7, 2023, raped numerous women and took hundreds of hostages back to the Gaza Strip. Nonetheless, the horrors have not stopped Bush and Tlaib from their public anti-Israel rhetoric.\nThe\nDaily Caller News Foundation identifies examples of the hateful representatives:\nBush, meanwhile, has\nasserted that the Israeli military is perpetrating “ethnic cleansing” against Palestinians and has called for the U.S. to stop funding Israel.\nTlaib, whose House colleagues voted to censure her for her anti-Israel rhetoric, and Bush, who is under\nfederal investigation for alleged misuse of federal security money, have both calledIsrael an “apartheid state.”\nBoth lawmakers have also\nsuggested that Israel could be committing genocide in its military response to the terrorist groups operating in the Gaza Strip, and they have both repeatedly called for a ceasefire since Israel’s ground invasion of the territory commenced.\nTlaib has defended the use of the Palestinian rallying cry, “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” which critics posit is a slogan that explicitly calls for the erasure of Israel and its people. She\nconsiders the saying to be “an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.”\n reply](/squad-democrats-only-votes-against-bill-to-ban-hamas-terrorists-from-entering-the-u-s/?utm_source=mux&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tw#respond)\nLeave a Reply\nIsrael\nVIDEO: Israeli commandos go undercover to take out terror cell in West Bank hospital\nIncredible video has surfaced of the impossible lengths Israeli forces go through in order to defeat terror. On Tuesday, Israeli commandos entered a West Bank hospital disguised as nurses and other civilians to take out three terrorists, one of whom the military said was planning an “imminent attack”.\nVideo\nshowed the soldiers dressed as medical personnel, women wearing hijabs, and a man holding a baby carrier as they moved through the Ibn Sina hospital. They killed Mohammed Jalamna, whom the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a press release was a Hamas terrorist sending weapons to other operatives and planning an attack inspired by Oct. 7. The IDF accused him of using the hospital as a hideout.\nThe commandos also killed brothers Mohammed and Basel Ghazawi, who were involved in the activities of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group. Hamas confirmed that Jalamna was a member of its Qassam Brigades, the terror group’s military wing, while Palestinian Islamic Jihad said the Ghazawi brothers belonged to its own armed Jenin Brigades, Reuters\nreported.\nDr. Naji Nazzal, the hospital’s director, told the outlet that Basel Ghazawi was receiving treatment for a spinal injury he sustained in October, which paralyzed him.\nYou may like\nTrending Now\n-\nNorthern border continues to outpace southwest border on terrorist-connected apprehensions\n-\n‘Squad’ Democrats only votes against Bill to ban Hamas terrorists from entering the U.S.\n-\nImmigration3 days ago\nFormer FBI officials issue warning on border crisis: U.S. has ‘been invaded’ by military-age foreign nationals\n-\nElections3 days ago\nFormer IRS contractor who leaked Trump’s taxes sentenced to five years in prison\n //saraacarter.com/former-fbi-officials-issue-warning-on-border-crisis-u-s-has-been-invaded-by-military-age-foreign-nationals/ []https://saraacarter.com/former-irs-contractor-who-leaked-trumps-taxes-sentenced-to-five-years-in-prison/",

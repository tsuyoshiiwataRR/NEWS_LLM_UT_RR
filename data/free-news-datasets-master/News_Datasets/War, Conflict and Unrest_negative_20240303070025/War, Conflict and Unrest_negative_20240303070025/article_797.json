    "text": "- The 38-year-old former international was shot six times by an unknown attacker Former Bolivian international footballer Sergio Jáuregui has been shot dead in cold blood while playing a friendly match in Mexico. The 38-year-old former international was shot six times by an unknown attacker at approximately 11 a.m. local time on Sunday during a friendly match in the Santa Inés neighborhood of Cuautla, Morelos. Defender Jáuregui had reportedly left the field to rehydrate on the bench for a brief moment during the game when a gunman approached him and shot his unsuspecting victim at point-blank range. It is said that the shooter fled the scene on a motorcycle that was waiting for him at the entrance to the field, leaving the soccer player mortally wounded. myEmergency services and ambulances rushed to the scene, but were unable to save the affected player, who died almost immediately. Images shared on social media showed a forensic investigation unit heading out into the field as they combed the scene for possible evidence. Bolivian footballer Sergio Jáuregui shot during friendly match Footage shared on social media showed a forensic investigation unit taking to the field as they combed the scene for possible evidence. Atlético de San Luis Rey, a team with which Jáuregui had an important career as a player, expressed its pain through a moving statement on its official Facebook page. ‘We regret the death of our former player and captain Sergio Jáuregui, who defended the colors of our team in the last Torneo de los Soles. We send our deepest condolences to his family,’ the heartfelt message said. ‘We appreciate how you defended our shield and left everything on the field game after game. Therefore, we will always carry you in our badge and heart. Many thanks to the ”Eternal Captain of Cuautla”, the message concluded. Jáuregui played most of his professional career in Bolivia, save for a brief move to Swiss top flight Yverdon-Sport FC in 2005, which lasted only a few months. He played about 13 international matches for his national team, but retired from professional sport in 2015, according to Diario AS, at just 30 years old. It is said that the shooter fled the scene on a motorcycle that was waiting for him at the entrance to the field, leaving the soccer player mortally wounded (results of the shooting in the photo). Jáuregui continued to positively impact the sport after his retirement from top-flight football, taking on a new role as an ambassador by participating in several “semi-professional” teams while dedicating himself to engaging young people in grassroots football. He ingratiated himself on the Mexican soccer scene with Club Deportivo Cuautla, also known as ‘Arroceros de Cuautla’, for several seasons. His commitment to promoting soccer talent was manifested in the opening of a youth soccer school, according to the respected Mexican media La Afificación de Milenio. Meanwhile, police are trying to determine the identity of the gunman and establish a motive for the cold-blooded murder.",

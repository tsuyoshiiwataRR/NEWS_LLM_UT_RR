    "text": "Violence and inflation in Haiti, and atypically low precipitation plus residual price shocks in Central America and Venezuela drive regional food insecurity Key Messages - Persistent insecurity and violence continue to drive food insecurity in Haiti. Cité Soleil continues to experience Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes as gang attacks intensify. Heavy rainfall and floods in mid-November exacerbated widespread Crisis outcomes (IPC Phase 3) across the rest of the country. Local production deficits and market supply chain dysfunction maintain food prices above last year's and the five-year average. Informal trade flows, the opening of other official control points, and trade with other regional partners, such as Colombia and Mexico, have helped to minimize the impact of the Dominican Republic border closure. - Through January, most of the Central American region will be classified as Stressed (IPC Phase 2) with seasonal improvements in food availability and access from the postrera harvest and income available to poor households because of labor demand in the agricultural, trade, and tourism sectors. From February to May, El Salvador and Nicaragua will remain classified as Stressed (IPC Phase 2); while Honduras will experience Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes as poor rural households in the north and Dry Corridor face increasingly constrained purchasing power due to the crop failure of both 2023 production cycles. In Guatemala, consecutive shocks, high food prices, and basic grain harvest losses will drive Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes in the Dry Corridor, Alta Verapaz, and the Western highlands, until May 2024. - In Venezuela, seasonal improvements in income and bettered macroeconomic conditions, have improved poor households' access to food. Increased USD supply and government revenues, as well as interventions by the Central Bank, have stabilized the exchange rate and minimized local currency (VED) inflation. Prices of food in USD and VED have remained stable for the fifth consecutive month but remain above last year's and the five-year average. Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are expected to persist across most states due to purchasing power constraints. Some poor households in peri-urban areas paid in local currency and rural smallholder farmers who faced crop losses during the 2023/2024 season will continue to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes; areas of highest concern include Distrito Capital, Guárico, and the states bordering Colombia (Zulia, Apure, and Táchira).

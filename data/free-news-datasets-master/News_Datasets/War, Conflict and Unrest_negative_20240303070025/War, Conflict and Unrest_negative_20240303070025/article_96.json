    "text": "[Genocide](/Subjects/00726-LAST-genocide.htm) • https://www.caitlinjohnst.one, CAITLIN JOHNSTONE [Democrats Are Demented Genocidal War Sluts](https://www.caitlinjohnst.one/p/democrats-are-demented-genocidal) These strikes are expected to include Iranian targets, tempting the nightmare scenario of a full-blown war with Iran, despite the public acknowledgement that there's no evidence Iran was behind the drone strike. Antiwar's Dave DeCamp explains: \"US officials told NBC News that the US is planning to launch a weeks-long bombing campaign in the Middle East in retaliation for the drone attack in northeast Jordan that killed three American soldiers. \"The officials said that the targets are expected to include Iranian targets outside of Iran, and the campaign will involve strikes and cyber operations. Other reports have said the US is considering targeting Iranians in Iraq and Syria or the Iranian navy. \"While the potential targets are not inside Iran, direct attacks on the Iranian military could provoke a full-blown war between the US and Iran. The US is considering taking this course of action even though the Pentagon admitted it has no evidence Iran was directly involved in the drone attack in Jordan.\" Iran [threatened](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-us-navy-mideast-tensions-israel-hamas-red-sea-6d5662d09aad8aed0875025b75928ef5) to \"decisively respond\" to any US attack, either upon the Islamic Republic itself or upon the nation's \"interests and nationals under any pretexts.\" So this looks to be yet another dramatic escalation in the middle east by the warmongering policies of the sitting US president, who has also been waging a new [bombing campaign in Yemen](https://news.antiwar.com/2024/01/31/us-launches-11th-round-of-strikes-against-houthis-in-yemen/) and backing a [genocide in Gaza](https://www.caitlinjohnst.one/p/israel-accuses-the-icj-of-you-guessed) of [unbelievable savagery](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2024/jan/30/how-war-destroyed-gazas-neighbourhoods-visual-investigation) where starving Palestinians are now [eating grass and drinking polluted water](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/30/middleeast/famine-looms-in-gaza-israel-war-intl/index.html) in a desperate attempt to survive. According to a memo [obtained by The Intercept](https://archive.is/Ro1j4), US troops have been put on standby for possible involvement in Israel's assault on Gaza as well. Biden, the man the media is telling us doesn't want war, is planning a weeks-long bombing campaign against Iranian targets in the Middle East. Remember, they have no evidence Iran was even involved in the attack that killed 3 US troops.— Dave DeCamp (@DecampDave) [pic.twitter.com/6OZNfUvfqL] [January 31, 2024]",

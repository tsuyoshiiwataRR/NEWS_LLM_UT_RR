    "text": "Opinion\nIran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and More Countries Joining Bloc Aligning Against the US\nIn what appears to be an unfortunate indicia of Joe Biden’s weak economic and diplomatic leadership, as well as CCP-controlled China’s ascendancy as potentially the globe’s primary superpower, the so-called BRICS group has added five new countries to its roster.\nThe expansion poses serious implications for energy production and access, as well as for America’s continued influence on world affairs.\nIran,\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Ethiopia are signing up for the multilateral trade organization, Bloomberg reported.\nBRICS is an acronym for its five original members: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, which formed as an alternative to the\nG7.\nThis expansion is significant in that it pairs “some of the planet’s largest energy producers with some of the biggest consumers among developing countries,” Bloomberg noted.\nStop the censors, sign up to get today's top stories delivered right to your inbox\nSimilarly, according to\nCNN, “The expansion adds the muscle of major oil-producing Gulf economies to the body and comes as both Russia and China have bolstered their relationships with sanctions-hit Iran.”\nThe endgame could theoretically render America an economic backwater. And economic security and\nnational security are deeply intertwined.\nArgentina, under its new president\nJavier Milei, the firebrand, pro-American libertarian foe of socialism, declined the BRICS invitation in a reversal of a decision by his predecessor in office.\nMore than 30 additional countries, however, are said to be waiting in the wings to link up with\nBRICS.\nIt seems that these emerging-market nations may have concluded that aligning with BRICS rather than with the U.S. is a better bet when it comes to the bottom line.\nThe market union for all of these countries is also significant, because it could minimize the effect of economic sanctions that the U.S. might impose amid international conflicts. With that in mind, it appears to lay the foundation for closer cooperation between and among many U.S. adversaries.\nThe expansion is a big win for\nChina, America’s main economic rival, as well as the Putin regime, CNN suggested.\n“China has been a key driver of its expansion as leader Xi Jinping pushes an alternative world order, forging closer partnerships with key global players from Russia to the Middle East and strengthening international bodies where Beijing holds sway. The expansion and continued interest from dozens more countries are also a boon for Russia, which has been shunned economically and diplomatically by the West following its invasion of Ukraine,” CNN explained.\nThis is a\nnew world order that the globalists in the U.S. and the European Union — and in the West in general — probably never anticipated.\nAs a negative byproduct of the tragic war in\nUkraine in addition to the massive human suffering and destruction in the region, authoritarian regimes in China, Russia and Iran (the latter which the U.S. State Department has designated as a state sponsor of terrorism) have drawn closer together, which is hardly good news for peace, freedom and free markets.\nReports have also emerged that China’s yuan could eventually replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency for global transactions, which gives another meaning, perhaps, to the term “great replacement theory.” The yuan has already become the third most demanded currency on The Moscow Exchange, and 17 percent of Russia’s foreign reserves are in yuan, according to\nYahoo Finance.\nThe next in-person BRICS meeting is scheduled to take place in Russia in October.\nIn a September essay for\nFox News, pundit Carol Roth asserted that climate extremism and hostility to fossil fuels play into the hands of China in several ways, including its effect on the U.S. dollar.\n“Arguably, our biggest export is U.S. dollars, which provides cheap financing for the U.S., particularly for the government and its unwieldy expansion. … Moving away from traditional energy is weakening the dollar’s role in terms of global oil trading, meaning potentially less oil traded in U.S. dollars and fewer ‘petrodollars” to be plowed back into the U.S. Treasury market,” she wrote.\n“China is trying to capitalize on this as well, working to form stronger alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The hope is that this will move even more global trade away from the U.S.’s highly entrenched position,” she added.\nLast year, reports emerged that\nBRICS contemplated a gold-based common currency aimed at depreciating both the U.S. dollar and the euro.\nThis article appeared originally on\nThe Western Journal.",

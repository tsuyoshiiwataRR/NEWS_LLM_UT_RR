    "text": "Pro Gamer’s Deception Unveiled: Faking Low IQ to Evade Military Service\nIn a recent development reported by Kossyderrickent, Chang-yeon, a professional FIFA player associated with South Korean EA FC, has been exposed for attempting to avoid mandatory military service through deceptive means.\nCompulsory Military Service for Esports Stars\nIt is a common practice for South Korean esports athletes to fulfill their mandatory military service.\nHowever, Chang-yeon, who played FIFA for Liiv SANDBOX, decided to take an unconventional route by feigning intellectual impairment.\nOriginal Clearance and Attempted Deception\nInitially, Chang-yeon received clearance for active duty based on his grades in the state physical examination.\nNevertheless, he resorted to dishonest tactics to manipulate the system.\nHe deliberately provided false answers during a psychological test at a local hospital, resulting in a fabricated diagnosis of mental disorders and an astonishingly low IQ of 53.\nStrategic Claims and Potential Exemption\nThe pro gamer went further by asserting that he was incapable of tolerating crowded spaces.\nWhile he might still have been obligated to fulfill his duties as social service personnel, a low IQ would have exempted him from basic military training and inclusion in the reserve forces.\nInvestigation Unravels Deceptive Practices\nUpon investigation, it was revealed that Chang-yeon, specializing in soccer video games, had been attempting to evade active duty service through multiple methods.\nInitially graded as a 2 in the state physical examination in 2011 and cleared for active duties, his subsequent re-test in 2015 yielded a grade 3.\nFurthermore, in the 2018 examination, he received a grade 4 due to being overweight, which still qualified him for serving active duty.\nThis incident sheds light on the lengths some individuals may go to in order to circumvent mandatory military service, even within the realm of professional esports.\nShare on Facebook«||» «||» «||»\nRead More On The Topic On TDPel Media",

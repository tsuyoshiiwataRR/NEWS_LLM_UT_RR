    "text": "Ukrainian Intelligence Head Signals Potential Strikes on Russian Infrastructure\nAFWERX Launches Autonomy Prime: A Leap Forward in Autonomous Systems for National Security\nIn a significant stride towards the future of autonomous systems for national security, AFWERX, the innovation branch of the Department of the Air Force, has launched a new initiative named Autonomy Prime. The program is an evolution of the successful Agility Prime initiative and will engage the expertise of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).\nA Step Towards Autonomous Technologies\nAutonomy Prime is designed to create symbiotic partnerships with the private sector, promoting rapid testing and introduction of autonomous technologies. To streamline this collaboration, AFWERX has put forth an innovative capabilities opening (ICO). The ICO will comprise future autonomy topic calls to target specific technological gaps.\nProving Ground for Future Innovation\nLt. Col. Bryan Ralston, the AFWERX Autonomy Prime branch chief, underscored the significance of this initiative for the Department of the Air Force. He revealed plans to set up a proving ground at Duke Field, Florida. This site will act as a ‘sandbox’ environment, allowing for the experimentation and testing of autonomous technologies, bypassing the usual delays associated with the testing approval process.\nReliable Robotics: A Step Ahead\nIn related news, Reliable Robotics has attained ‘military airworthiness approval’ to begin utilizing its Cessna 208 Caravan for demonstrating pilotless flight to the US Air Force. The company successfully demonstrated its dual-use control station for military deployment and is now part of the USAF’s Autonomy Prime program. This approval, granted post safety, maintenance, and operational evaluations, marks a significant milestone in the company’s Small Business Innovation Research program. Its competitor, Xwing, is also showcasing autonomous flight technology for the USAF.\nIn conclusion, these initiatives and collaborations signify a bold advance in the realm of autonomous systems for national security. The implications of these developments are far-reaching, as they not only promise to revolutionize the aerospace sector but also redefine the contours of national security in the United States.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/breaking-news/health/the-imperative-of-it-asset-disposition-in-healthcare-balancing-technology-security-and-sustainability/",

    "text": "Zoom In light of dangerously growing tensions in the Middle East and the increasingly dire situation in Gaza, we are holding another meet-up session on Saturday, February 10, at 9:00AM PT (12:00 PM ET). Joining us will be Nobel Peace Prize winner Mairead Maguire, and Dr. Aisha Jumaan, epidemiologist and president of the Yemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation. This will be a fascinating conversation with two world-renowned peace activists, as well as an opportunity for you to discuss your concerns about world events, nonviolent actions you may have taken in response to events, and additional actions you would like to see the War Crimes Tribunal take. This will be our third meet-up session and will provide an opportunity for the Tribunal to share new information and to hear from participants who have been so important throughout this Tribunal process.

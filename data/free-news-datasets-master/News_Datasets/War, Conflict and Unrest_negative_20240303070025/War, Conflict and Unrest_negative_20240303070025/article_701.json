    "text": "Biden imposes sanctions on four Israelis: Reasons revealed President Joe Biden has imposed sanctions on four Israelis, accusing them of involvement in settler violence on the West Bank, according to Reuters. Biden issued an executive order punishing individuals who attacked Palestinians on the West Bank, where they seek to create their future state. \"The order establishes a system for imposing financial sanctions and visa restrictions against individuals who attack or intimidate Palestinians or seize their property. Todayâ€™s actions seek to promote peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike,\" said White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in a statement. Those under sanctions include: - David Chai Chasdai, who initiated and led a riot during which vehicles and buildings were set on fire, causing damage to property in Huwara, leading to the death of a Palestinian civilian. - Einan Tanjil, who attacked Palestinian farmers and Israeli activists by throwing stones and sticks at them, resulting in injuries that required medical assistance. War in Israel On October 7, Hamas militants invaded Israel. They killed and kidnapped both military and civilian individuals. In response, Israel declared the start of Operation Iron Swords and shelled the locations of the terrorists. On November 24, Israel signed an agreement with Hamas for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. The militants released the [ first group of hostages](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/israel-hamas-ceasefire-militants-release-1700839513.html) on the same day. The ceasefire lasted until December 1. After that, [the Israeli Defense Forces announced the rupture of the agreement](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/israel-resumes-fighting-in-gaza-says-hamas-1701413247.html) due to Hamas shelling Israeli territory. On December 20, [Israel proposed to Palestinians to once again agree to a ceasefire](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/israel-offers-hamas-week-long-truce-details-1703045871.html) for a week. However, Hamas rejected the proposal. The information about Israel's offer to Hamas to suspend hostilities [became known just last week](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/israel-proposed-to-hamas-to-suspend-hostilities-1705972427.html).",

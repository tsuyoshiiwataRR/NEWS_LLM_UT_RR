    "text": "The basketball players from Alba Berlin lost to Valencia Basket in the Euroleague.\nThe basketball players of\nAlba Berlin lost to Valencia Basket in the Euroleague. On Thursday evening, the Berlin team lost 66:81 (15:20, 15:22, 15:23, 21:16) against the ninth-place team. For Alba Berlin it is already the 20th defeat in the 25th game of the current Euroleague season. The best Berlin throwers were Matt Thomas with 15 and Khalifa Koumadje with 13 points.\nAlba Berlin’s first national player and the dream of the Olympics\nAlba Berlin currently cannot lose in the women’s basketball Bundesliga. One of the guarantees of success: Energy bundle Theresa Simon. She also sees a realistic chance of something historic with the national team.\nmore\nAlba has no chance\nIn front of 9,235 fans in the arena at Ostbahnhof, the hosts had big problems with the Spaniards’ physical superiority from the start. Alba only managed three points in six minutes, so the deficit reached double digits (3:14) in the middle of the first quarter.\nAfterwards, Alba fought a little better into the game and showed improvement, especially defensively. In the second quarter, Israel Gonzalez’s team got within three points (20:23). But there was still a problem offensively. Apart from Thomas (13 points in the first half), no Berliner scored consistently.\nIn the third quarter the guests finally pulled away. The Spaniards continued to hit their three-point shots. The Berliners also allowed them too many rebounds. At the end of the third period the deficit grew to 22 points (43:65). After that, Alba Valenicia Basket could no longer be dangerous.\nThe Albatrosses continue in the Bundesliga on Sunday. Alba Berlin welcomes the German champions Ulm at 5 p.m.\nBroadcast: rbb24, February 1st, 2024, 9:45 p.m",

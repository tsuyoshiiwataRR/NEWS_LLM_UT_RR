    "text": "ISLAMABAD/ SANGHAR: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Thursday said that his party was once again the target of terrorists but they could not be scared. Addressing an election campaign rally in Khuzdar, Bilawal said: “There have been frequent attacks on PPP ticket holders in the last few days. One attack was carried out in Mastung, two in Turbat, one on Asghar Rind and the other on Zahoor Buledi, and attacks were made in Bolan. “Our party’s former provincial president Ali Madad Jatak was attacked in Quetta, and Agha Shakil Durrani was attacked in Khuzdar. The terrorists thought that PPP and I would be scared but this is their mistake,” he added. The PPP chairman said those forces are targeting his party who do not want it to form the government in Balochistan and the Centre, because they know that if Bilawal becomes the prime minister and a Jiyala becomes a chief minister in Balochistan, all their conspiracies will fail. “They know that Baloch blood runs in my veins, they know the way I feel the pain of Balochistan, no other politician does,” he said. “They know that I will not only fight the terrorists but at the same time solve the problem of missing persons,” he added. He warned that just as conspiracies are taking place inside the country, conspiracies are also being hatched abroad, adding that he will engage with all our neighbouring countries. It is the discretion of the people to do business with those countries. The PPP chairman appealed to the people of Balochistan to maintain their distance from the politics of terrorism. “Don’t allow anyone else to do injustice to our children and women. Quaid-i-Azam had created this country and established Pakistan without firing a single bullet.” He added: “I will explain to them that the Federation cannot run like this. I am sad that the way the caretaker government engaged the protesters in Islamabad was undemocratic.” He pointed out that former president Asif Ali Zardari had pioneered the development of Balochistan province in the form of CPEC but Nawaz Sharif changed the direction of the corridor as soon as he became the prime minister for the third time and prevented the country’s most backward province from moving towards prosperity. Separately, addressing a women convention in Sanghar, PPP leader Aseefa Bhutto Zardari said if the people use the power of vote properly, Pakistan would become stronger and more powerful. Aseefa said that when Benazir was the prime minister, public welfare was included in her every cabinet meeting. She said that Bilawal would also follow it as the prime minister and his first priority would be to serve the poor people. She said that Bilawal had given a poor-friendly and public-friendly manifesto in the elections. The PBS will conduct this census in 12,000 Mouzas out of the total of 52,000 mouzas all over the country He said Bahramand Tangi was silent over resolution by independent Senator Dilawar Khan calling for postponement of...",

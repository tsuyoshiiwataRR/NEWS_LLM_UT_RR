    "text": "Rep. Duncan Lambasts Biden’s Anti-Israel Executive Order Washington, D.C. — Following Joe Biden’s irrational executive order that takes aim at Israelis who are defending themselves from a radical terrorist organization by instituting economic sanctions on them, Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) issued the following statement: “Joe Biden’s fallacious executive order against our ally Israel is another foreign policy failure by the Biden administration,” said Congressman Jeff Duncan. “The Commander-in-Chief should unequivocally stand with our ally Israel as they exercise their right to self-defense and fight back against Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists who believe Israel does not have the right to exist—the same cowardly terrorists that kill Americans, behead babies, and kidnap children.” “This is another example in the long line of Biden’s foreign policy failures. Mr. President, why do you continually choose to endanger the lives of Americans, turn your back on America’s allies, and choose to go easy on or cooperate with terrorist regimes?” ### Background: In 2021, Joe Biden acted contrary to sound military advice in his withdrawal from Afghanistan. The President recklessly left behind thousands of American civilians and Afghan allies, along with taxpayer-financed weapons and military equipment, endangering the lives of the American people and the security of the United States. [Biden showed reckless disregard for both American citizens and allies](//jeffduncan.house.gov/media/press-releases/duncan-supports-articles-impeachment-against-president-biden) in neglecting to secure their safe evacuation from Afghanistan once he withdrew our troops. In September of 2023, the Biden Administration negotiated a prisoner swap with Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism, and put a target on the back of every American. Biden traded 6 Americans for 6 Iranians and gave Iran 6 billion dollars. America should NEVER pay ransoms as it sends a message to nefarious countries that they can target American citizens and get a payday from the government. It’s time we get tough on sponsors of terrorism, not negotiate with them. Militant groups backed by Iran have attacked our military 150+ times since October 7. On Saturday, they attacked again killing 3 servicemembers and injuring 34 troops. This is the same Iran that Biden tried to give $6 billion as part of a prisoner swap. The President should stop negotiating with terrorists and start protecting our military. We need a Commander-in-Chief who strikes fear in our enemies and prioritizes the safety of our military and citizens. The Biden administration’s senseless about-face on bipartisan digital trade policies is another example of Joe Biden putting American interests last and allowing China to thrive. Despite disapproval from the National Security Council and without so much as a notice to the State Department, US Trade Representative Ambassador Tai and [the Biden Administration placed American jobs in jeopardy and bolstered authoritarian regimes](//jeffduncan.house.gov/media/press-releases/chair-duncan-and-rep-joyce-exercise-oversight-us-trade-ambassador-reneging). Joe Biden jeopardizes American energy security and national security by placing the political demands of environmental activists over the responsibility he bears to ensure affordable, reliable, and clean energy for America. Instead of unleashing American energy production and exports with American LNG that is 40% cleaner than Russian LNG, [Joe Biden forces America and our allies to be energy-dependent on adversaries like Russia and China](//jeffduncan.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-jeff-duncan-decries-joe-bidens-attack-american-energy).

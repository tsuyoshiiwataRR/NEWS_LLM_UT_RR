    "text": "[Rep. Ilhan Omar](https://www.salon.com/2020/01/09/republian-jim-banks-attacks-war-survivor-ilhan-omar-for-invoking-her-ptsd-amid-iran-tensions/) (D-MN) has become the target of Republican ire after an inaccurate translation of a speech delivered in Somali last week triggered desires to racially and culturally profile her — with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) taking up the charge, calling for her censure and deportation. In the speech in question, which was given at the Minneapolis Hyatt Hotel at a celebration of the recent election in Puntland, a region of Somalia, Omar is reported to have told the audience that Somalia would remain united, and that she would use her influence to keep it that way, according to [Minnesota Reformer](https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/02/01/republicans-smeared-ilhan-omar-over-a-faulty-translation-heres-what-she-really-said/), which, along with a befuddled understanding of the rest of her speech on the part of Republicans, ignited the questioning of her allegiance to the United States. \"Today, I’m introducing a Censure Resolution on Ilhan Omar for admitting she’s working as a foreign agent for a foreign country,\" Greene declared in a post to X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday. \"I urge my colleagues to vote to Censure, but I wish I had the votes to expel and deport her.\"",

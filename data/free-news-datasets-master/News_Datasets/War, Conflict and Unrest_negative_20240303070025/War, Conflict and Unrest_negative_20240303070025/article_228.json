    "text": "Amid expansion of the scope of tensions across West Asia, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian says war is not the solution to the region's crises. The top diplomat made the remarks on Thursday, speaking on the phone with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry. \"Iran is not after expansion of the war, since we do not consider warfare to be the solution to the region's growing crises,\" the former said. Amir-Abdollahian rather considered the Israeli regime's ongoing genocidal war against the Gaza Strip as well as Tel Aviv's continued atrocities and occupation of regional territories to be the source of the crises that have afflicted the region. Israel began its brutal war on Gaza on October 7, 2023 after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas carried out Operation al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity in retaliation for its intensified atrocities against the Palestinian people. So far, the Tel Aviv regime has killed at least 26,900 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 65,949 others. \"All countries should focus on immediate cessation of war and atrocities against Gaza, and [implementation of] political solution towards resolution of crisis in Gaza and the [occupied] West Bank,\" Amir-Abdollahian added. 'Iran ready to send aid to Gaza' Elsewhere in his remarks, the Iranian official expressed gratitude towards Cairo for its efforts aimed at transfer of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. Amir-Abdollahian voiced Iran's readiness to provide the oppressed Palestinian people with necessary relief items in coordination with the Egyptian government and the United Nations. The officials laid emphasis on the need for diplomatic endeavor towards putting up serious and effective opposition to \"Zionist projects\" aimed at forced displacement of Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan. They also stressed the importance of a collective push on the part of the regional countries towards preservation of stability and calm across the region.

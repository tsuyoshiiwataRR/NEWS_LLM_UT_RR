    "text": "New Delhi: On the third anniversary of the coup by the military junta, India expressed concern at the “deteriorating” security situation in Myanmar, with government forces facing a series of setbacks in intense fighting with rebels.\nThree years ago, the Myanmar military overturned civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and imprisoned all the main leaders. Since then, the country has been roiled by violence with ethnic armed groups and pro-democracy organisations fighting with the military, which has intensified in last one year.\n“Today happens to be 1st of February, it marks the third anniversary of developments. On that I would like to say, that we are concerned with the deteriorating situation in Myanmar, which has direct implications for us,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal at the MEA briefing today, February 1.\nHe asserted that India has been “long advocating for complete cessation of violence and Myanmar’s transition towards inclusive federal democracy”.\n“We want an early resolution of the issue through constructive dialogue and return of peace and stability in the country,” added Jaiswal.\nIndia, along with all other neighbours of Myanmar, have retained relations with the Myanmar military junta, which has been the target of sanctions by the west since the coup.\nThe violence has led to thousands of people to cross the border into the north-eastern region of India, where they share common ethnic connections.\nMake a contribution to Independent Journalism",

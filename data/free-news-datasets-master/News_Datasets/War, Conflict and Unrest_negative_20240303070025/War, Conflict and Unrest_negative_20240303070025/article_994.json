    "text": "AAT Kings Group Unveils Loyalty Program as Bali Abandons Proposed Entertainment Tax\nSouth Korea Probes Alleged Tech Theft of KF-21 Fighter Jet by Indonesian Engineers\nSouth Korean authorities have instigated an investigation into a group of Indonesian engineers under suspicion of stealing technology related to the development of the KF-21 fighter jet. The engineers, employed at Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), caused alarm when it was discovered they may have stored sensitive data regarding the jet’s development on a USB drive.\nThe Investigation\nThe Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) and Defense Counterintelligence Command have taken the helm in this probe, drawing support from the National Intelligence Service. The Indonesian engineers are currently prohibited from leaving South Korea, as the investigation is ongoing and seeks to determine if the data includes strategic technologies.\nIndonesia’s Role in the KF-21 Project\nIndonesia is partnered in the development of the KF-21 project but has been lagging in its financial commitments. It has contributed only 278.3 billion won of its promised 20 percent share of the 8.8 trillion won total cost. This financial shortfall, coupled with the alleged theft of technology, is casting a shadow over the partnership.\nSouth Korea’s Ambitious Fighter Jet Program\nDespite these setbacks, South Korea is steadfast in its plan to produce the KF-21 fighter jets. The nation is intent on deploying 120 units by 2032, marking a significant step in its military aviation ambitions. The KF-21 is a symbol of South Korea’s technological prowess, and any compromise of its intellectual property is seen as a threat to the country’s strategic interests.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/world/chitungwiza-municipality-launches-verification-process-for-land-stand-offer-letters-amid-fraud-concerns/",

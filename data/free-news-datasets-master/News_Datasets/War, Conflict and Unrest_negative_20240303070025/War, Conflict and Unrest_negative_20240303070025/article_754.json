    "text": "(NEW YORK) -- More than 100 days since Hamas terrorists invaded Israel on Oct. 7, the Israeli military continues its bombardment of the neighboring Gaza Strip.\nThe conflict, now the deadliest between the warring sides since Israel's founding in 1948, shows no signs of letting up soon and the brief cease-fire that allowed for over 100 hostages to be freed from Gaza remains a distant memory.\nHere's how the news is developing. All times Eastern:\nFeb 01, 2:27 PM\nHamas receives proposed hostage deal: Qatari official\nHamas has received a new proposed hostage deal but has not yet responded, a Qatari official told ABC News.\n\"There is no deal yet,\" said a Qatari official with knowledge of the negotiations. \"Hamas has received the proposal positively but we are waiting for their response.\"\nFeb 01, 1:26 PM\nSome Gazans say they're forced to use bird feed in place of flour\nThe possibility of a \"full-fledged famine\" looms large across the entire Gaza Strip, humanitarian groups have warned -- especially in northern Gaza, where some people there say they're using bird feed in place of flour to stave off starvation.\nNorthern Gaza has been largely cut off for months now, according to the United Nations, and aid trucks carrying flour arrive sporadically and are swarmed by hundreds of hungry people.\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East officials also say Israel provides too few authorizations to make deliveries into some areas and that heavy fighting often makes it too dangerous for aid workers to operate. The aid arriving in northern Gaza has been particularly restricted, the U.N. says. Israel disputes the criticisms.\n\"For more than two months, we have not received flour due to the difficulty of aid entering and the scarcity of flour in the area,\" Sami Abu Sweilem, a 55-year-old father who is sheltering in a UNRWA school in northern Gaza, told ABC News.\n\"Children almost died of hunger, so we thought of a way to save our children from death,\" he said, explaining how he's been using bird feed and animal fodder in place of precious flour.\nFeb 01, 12:00 PM\nExecutive order targets four Israeli settlers involved in attacks on Palestinians in West Bank\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order Thursday to sanction four Israeli settlers involved in attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to the State Department. The sanctions will prohibit them from accessing the U.S. financial system and property in the U.S. and will block them from receiving financial transactions from U.S. citizens.\nThe move escalates U.S. posture against the hardline elements in Israeli society amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. In December, the U.S. imposed a visa ban on Israelis linked to violence and unrest in the West Bank that impacted \"dozens\" of settlers in the Israeli-occupied territory, according to the State Department.\nFeb 01, 11:05 AM\nBiden to sign executive order targeting Israeli settlers involved in attacks on Palestinians\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order to sanction Israeli settlers involved in attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, two sources familiar with the plans confirmed to ABC News. The news was first reported by Axios.\nThe move would escalate U.S. posture against the hardline elements in Israeli society amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\nIt was not immediately clear how many Israelis would be targeted by the administration's actions. In December, the U.S. imposed a visa ban on Israelis linked to violence and unrest in the West Bank that impacted \"dozens\" of settlers in the Israeli-occupied territory, according to the State Department.\nFeb 01, 7:40 AM\nUNRWA warns operations will be shut down by end of February without funding\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East warned Thursday that it \"will most likely be forced to shut down\" its operations in the war-torn Gaza Strip and the wider region \"by the end of February\" if funding does not resume.\nSixteen donor countries, including the United States, have suspended financial support to the U.N. agency over Israel's allegations that 13 UNRWA staff members were involved in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terror attack. UNRWA said it is investigating the accusations and that \"full accountability and transparency are expected out of this process, should the allegations be substantiated.\"\n\"As the war in Gaza is being pursued unabated, and at the time the International Court of Justice calls for more humanitarian assistance, it is the time to reinforce and not to weaken UNRWA. The Agency remains the largest aid organization in one of the most severe and complex humanitarian crises in the world,\" UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement Thursday. \"I echo the call of the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres to resume funding to UNRWA. If the funding remains suspended, we will most likely be forced to shut down our operations by end of February not only in Gaza but also across the region.\"\nFeb 01, 6:21 AM\nWhat we know about the conflict\nThe latest outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that governs the Gaza Strip, has reached the three-month mark.\nIn the Gaza Strip, at least 27,019 people have been killed and 66,139 others have been wounded by Israeli forces since Oct. 7, according to Gaza's Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health.\nIn Israel, at least 1,200 people have been killed and 6,900 others have been injured by Hamas and other Palestinian militants since Oct. 7, according to the Israel Defense Forces.\nThere has also been a surge in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israeli forces have killed at least 297 people in the territory since Oct. 7, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.\nThe ongoing war began after Hamas-led militants launched an unprecedented incursion into southern Israel from neighboring Gaza via land, sea and air. Scores of people were killed while more than 200 others were taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. The Israeli military subsequently launched retaliatory airstrikes followed by a ground invasion of Gaza, a 140-square-mile territory where more than two million Palestinians have lived under a blockade imposed by Israel and supported by Egypt since Hamas came to power in 2007. Gaza, unlike Israel, has no air raid sirens or bomb shelters.",

    "text": "This year, the non-stop Israeli bombardment and thousands of lives lost means that Valentine’s day will be a difficult day in Gaza. Bombings have destroyed most properties in Gaza and thousands face imminent famine. People will not be celebrating in ways Gazans have in past years: sharing sweets, Gaza-grown flowers, balloons, and red teddy bears.\nWe join many throughout the world demanding a cease-fire and continuing our advocacy for an end to Israeli military occupation, apartheid, genocide, and blockade.\nNow more than ever we wish to reach Palestinians in Gaza with a message of love, as we work for a day when flowers once again can bloom in Gaza.\nHow to share your Valentine to Gaza\n- Print this graphic, take a photo holding it and share on your social media. Tag @ afsc_org on\nTikTok, and use #LoveToGaza.\n- Download\nthis graphicand change your social media profile picture for the month of February and reshare our posts on social media.\nIdeas for where to take your photo:\n- With your legislator\n- At a city landmark or iconic location\n- With your congregation/club/class\n- At a rally or event\nWhat to do after you send a Valentine\nCall on Congress to support an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. Ask your followers to call and write everyday.\n- Share about the immediate need for humanitarian aid. Ask your followers to donate to\nwww.afsc.org/give2gaza.\n“If you grew up in [Gaza] Palestine like I did, you knew it was Valentine’s Day season when the best pop songs are released, when everyone on the streets was wearing red, and when all the locally grown roses were nearly sold out. As a little boy, I wasn’t concerned with buying romantic gifts, but I did enjoy the atmosphere and the energy on the streets of Gaza as people took the time to step away from the harsh reality of our surroundings to focus on romance, beauty, and gratitude.” Hani Almadhoun, UNRWA-USA, 2020",

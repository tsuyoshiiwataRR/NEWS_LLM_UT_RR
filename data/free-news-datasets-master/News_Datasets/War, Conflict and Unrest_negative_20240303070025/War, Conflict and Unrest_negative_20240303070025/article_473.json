    "text": "Last Updated on February 1, 2024 J6 Patriot and leading candidate for Congress in West Virginia’s 1st District, Derrick Evans labeled GOP incumbent Carol Miller a “traitor” after her vote with Democrats and the GOP establishment to approve Chuck Schumer’s Continuing Resolution that funds the persecution of President Trump and the invasion of America. West Virginia Rep. Carol Miller (R-1), a staunch supporter of Kevin McCarthy’s short-lived speakership, voted in favor of the continuing resolution backed by Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and Mike Johnson, that allowed the Biden Regime to continue its campaign against America to the tune of more than $1.6 trillion. The big spending package is just the latest to be approved by Miller, who has also voted to send aid to Ukraine and to [keep American troops in Syria](https://nationalfile.com/war-hawk-carol-miller-voted-against-bringing-troops-home-from-syria/). “Democrats are weaponizing government against Donald Trump going into 2024, and rather than fighting to defund Joe Biden’s out-of-control Department of Justice and Jack Smith’s lawless prosecution of Donald Trump, RINO Carol Miller is voting to fund the destruction of Donald Trump,” Evans told National File. “Congress just passed a CR that funds everything on Biden’s wish list, and West Virginia’s own Carol Miller voted with Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer,” Evans said. “There was NO FUNDING to bring to an end the weaponization of Joe Biden’s DOJ against President Trump. There are NO cuts in spending.” “This budget funds Open Borders, and allows Alejandro Mayorkas to continue the invasion at our southern border — even as a handful of Republicans in the House try to impeach Mayorkas in the Homeland Security committee,” Evans explained. “Carol Miller doesn’t just need to be removed from office. She needs to be arrested and tried for TREASON,” said Derrick Evans. “Yes. I’m calling Carol Miller a TRAITOR!” [Related: General Flynn Endorses J6 Patriot Derrick Evans for Congress in WV](https://nationalfile.com/general-flynn-endorses-j6-patriot-derrick-evans-for-congress-in-wv/) “United States Code makes it very clear,” Evans said. “Title 8, U.S.C. § 1324(a) (1)(A)(iv): it is a federal crime to conspire with others to bring unauthorized aliens into the United States or assist them in doing so, whether for financial gain or not,” Evans said. “Article III of the U.S. Constitution states: ‘Treason against the United States shall consist . . . in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort,'” Evans explained. “By supporting sanctuary jurisdictions, refusing to pay for the wall, and allowing the border to remain open, Biden and Mayorkas both are giving aid and comfort to aliens who show contempt for our laws and sovereignty. By definition, these invaders are enemies of the United States. Therefore, Joe Biden and anyone helping to enact this policy is a traitor,” Evans said. “No member of the U.S. Congress or of any government anywhere should be immune from prosecution for treason on these grounds. Not Ilhan Omar. Not Rashida Tlaib. Not Joe Biden. Not Kamala Harris. Not Chuck Schumer. And Not Carol Miller,” Evans added. “When I am elected by the great patriots of West Virginia, I will stop at nothing to make sure traitors are treated as they deserve — with swift accountability.” [Related: West Virginia Rep.

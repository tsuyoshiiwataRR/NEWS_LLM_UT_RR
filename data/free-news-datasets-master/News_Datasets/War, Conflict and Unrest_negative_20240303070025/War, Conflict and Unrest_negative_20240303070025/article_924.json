    "text": "CUMBERLAND, MD. (WV News) – After suffering a disappointing, 19-point, 82-63 loss at Petersburg on Tuesday, the Keyser Golden Tornado rallied at Fort Hill on Wednesday, taking the No. 1 ranked Sentinels to the brink before falling in a four-point, 63-59 loss.\nDespite the loss, the showing at Fort Hill was a very good one. But first, a word about the Petersburg loss for Keyser.\nPetersburg jumped up on Keyser early, and by the time the Black and Gold started to see better results, it was too little, too late.\nThe host Vikings led the visiting Tornado 22-13 at the end of one period, and 46-26 at the half. Keyser edged Petersburg 19-17 in the third frame but still trailed 63-45 entering the game’s fourth period. There, Petersburg’s 19-18 edge kept Keyser at arms-length in the Vikings’ 82-63 victory.\nPetersburg was led in double figures by the trio of Caden Ours, Peyton Tingler, and Trace Rohrbuagh. Ours tallied 21, Tingler 19, and Rohrbaugh 18 in the win. Additionally, Caden Arbaugh posted four points, and Jack Boddy and Lucas Riggleman two points each.\nIn the loss, Patrick Liller and Drew Matlick teamed to lead Keyser with 10 points each. Next was Jace Courrier and Grayson Lamka with nine points apiece, Kam Samples with eight points, Evan Ack with seven points, and Layton Valentine and Jack Stanislawczyk three points each. Finally, Damarian Allen posted two points, and Chase Davis and Ian Spiker one point apiece. 11 Tornado players scored.\nPoor shooting at the free throw line doomed Keyser. The Golden Tornado went only 13 of 29 from the charity stripe in the loss.\n“We lost by 19, and Petersburg shot disgustingly well. But, we missed 16 free throws. We’ve talked about the free throw aspect, and of course, the careless turnovers,” Keyser coach Scott Furey stated.\nThen came the Fort Hill game, one in which most observers would be won big by the Sentinels. But Keyser had other thoughts, turning in what likely was their best performance of the year, despite the four-point, 63-59 loss.\nIronically, things didn’t start the greatest for Keyser as Fort Hill nearly doubled up the Tornado 19-10 in the game’s first period. Deshaun Brown led the Sentinels with 13 points in the opener. Keyser was led by Jace Courrier with six points.\nIn the second period, Keyser came alive, outscoring Fort Hill 19-9 to take a one-point, 29-28 lead at the half. Patrick Liller and Kam Samples led Keyser with five points each in the second stanza. Fort Hill was led by Jabril Daniels with five points.\nKeyser continued to play well into the third frame, but Fort Hill’s response to being down at the half was to outscore Keyser 20-15 to regain the lead entering the game’s fourth period, 48-44. Daniels and Brown again led Fort Hill with six points each. Samples led the Black and Gold with six points.\nThe fourth and final period represented a continued tough battle between the two squads, with each scoring 15 points apiece. As such, Fort Hill would ultimately hold their four-point lead in the 63-59 victory. Brown posted eight points for the Sentinels in the final frame. Chase Davis scored 10 points for Keyser in the lid closer.\n“The effort was there, and honestly, execution was there at times. There were just some crucial turnovers, and going eight for 16 from the line, and one for five in the fourth quarter, didn’t help us as well,” Furey stated.\nWhat went well?\n“I think defensively, we were able to execute what we wanted to do. We didn’t want to let them just dribble-drive all over the place. We forced them into jump shots. Deshaun hit a bunch early, he had 13 in the first quarter. That kind of got them going, but, for the most part, our biggest thing was making sure we rebounded the basketball. For the most part, we rebounded the ball really well,” Furey detailed.\nWhat didn’t go well?\n“We turned the ball over 20 times, and we really didn’t get pressed or forced. A lot of them were unforced and live-ball turnovers that turned into layups. Therein lies your real issue. Unfortunately, that’s two games in a row, we had the same thing last night against Petersburg,” Furey explained.\nFort Hill was led overall by Deshaun Brown with a game-high 27 points. Also in double figures for the Sentinels was Jabril Daniels with 15 points, and Gavin Carney with 11 points. Gamil Daniels and Steven Spencer each scored five points apiece.\nIn the loss, Keyser was led overall in double figures by Kam Samples with 12 points, Grayson Lambka with 11 points, and Chase Davis with 10 points. Next was Jace Courrier and Jack Stanislawczyk with six points apiece, Patrick Liller and Evan Ack with five points each, and Drew Matlick with four points.\n“Kam has the confidence. He plays a ton of basketball all year. Not necessarily the travel stuff, but he’s at the playground all summer long. He has confidence about being able to play and his abilities. He’s starting to come into his own, and I think he’s really starting to understand what his role is for us,” Furey stated.\nKeyser (5-9) will next look to rebound at home against Allegany on Friday, Feb. 2 at 7:30 p.m.\n“Everybody knows that we’re not a bad basketball team, on our team. But whenever you look up and you’re so close, and so close, and so close. I tell them all the time, put that on me, the coach lost the game, we got outcoached, whatever, put that on me. But, the thing is, they are so ready to crack through that and get that statement win,” Furey explained.\nAccording to Furey, “Winning here would have been a huge thing. Now we’ve got Allegany coming in Friday, and so it doesn’t get any easier, and then Southern Monday. It’s a gauntlet, Murderer’s Row type deal for us, but, I told them, we have to play a stretch like this if we’re going to get to where we’re going to get.”",

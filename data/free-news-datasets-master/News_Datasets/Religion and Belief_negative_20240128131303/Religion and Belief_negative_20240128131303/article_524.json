    "text": "Guwahati, December 29: Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has apologised for uploading a post with casteist remarks on his social media platforms saying that his team made an &quot;incorrect translation&quot; of a verse from the Bhagavad Gita. Sarma in a post on X and Facebook on Thursday night said that he uploads one verse of Bhagavad Gita every morning on his social media handles, which have posted 668 Slokas till date. &quot;Recently one of my team members posted a sloka from Chapter 18 verse 44 with an incorrect translation. As soon as I noticed the mistake, I promptly deleted the post... If the deleted post has offended anyone, I sincerely apologise,&quot; he said. ‚ÄòAssam Picture of Casteless Society‚Äô: Himanta Biswa Sarma Apologises For Incorrect Translation of Bhagavad Gita Verse. The chief minister stressed that Assam reflects a &quot;perfect picture&quot; of a casteless society due to the reform movement led by Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardeva. On December 26, Sarma had uploaded an audio-visual post on his social media handles like X and Facebook that he claimed to be from Sloka 44 of Sanyas Yoga from the 18th chapter of Gita. Assam Govt Announces Vacancies for Over 10,000 Posts in Education Department; CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Says, &#039;Will Exceed Promise of Creating More Than 1 Lakh Government Jobs&#039;. The animated video stated that &quot;farming, cow-rearing and commerce are habitual and natural duties of the Vaishya, while serving the three &#039;varnas&#039; -- Brahman, Kshatriya and Vaishya -- is the natural duty of the Shudras.&quot; Sharing this video, Sarma even said: &quot;God Sri Krishna himself described the types of natural duties of Vaishya and Shudras.&quot; This sparked a massive political row with opposition leaders denouncing what they called the &quot;BJP&#039;s Manuvadi and regressive ideology&quot;. Facing a volley of criticism, Sarma later deleted the post from all his social media platforms.",

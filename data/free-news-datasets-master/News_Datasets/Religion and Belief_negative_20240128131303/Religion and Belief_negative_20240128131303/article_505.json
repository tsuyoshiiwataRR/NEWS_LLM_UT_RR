    "title": "Matthew Ehret: The Plymouth Brethren, British intelligence and mystic cults in Palestine",
    "text": "Historically, British intelligence has supported both Islamist cults throughout the Arab world and the most fascist and violent Zionist ideologues, writes Matthew Ehret. This “should not be seen as contradictory in any way.” He highlights the role of British intelligence assets in Palestine in the mid-1800s and first half of the 20th century. These intelligence assets were also either Plymouth Brethren or Freemasons. George Hawkins Pember, another Plymouth Brethren, whose works on ancient mystery cults, Zionism, prophecy, and even alien interpretations of scripture have done an incredible amount of damage in shaping imperial strategic planning for over 150 years, Ehret says. Previously Ehret described that without the force of numerous anti-Semitic fascists throughout the last two centuries, Zionism would have never been possible. He continued to set the scene by describing “apostolic” cults operating under the banner of Christianity which contributed to the belief that all Jews should be sent to Palestine and describing the role of the Knights Templar. Ehret recently wrote an essay titled ‘Sir Henry Kissinger: Midwife to New Babylon’ describing how Henry Kissinger’s 2012 prophecy that “in 10 years, there will be no more Israel” is linked to mystical Babylon. As his essay is more than most would read in one sitting, we are republishing it in sections over a series of articles, you can read Part 1 [HERE](https://expose-news.com/2023/12/24/the-babylon-conspiracy-two-angles/), Part 2 [HERE](https://expose-news.com/2023/12/26/without-numerous-anti-semitic-fascists-zionism/), Part 3 [HERE](https://expose-news.com/2023/12/27/gnostic-cults-masquerading-as-christian-movements/) and Part 4 [HERE](https://expose-news.com/2023/12/28/knights-templar-and-the-kingdom-of-jerusalem/).

Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inbox… The Plymouth Brethren Start Religious Fires Another Plymouth Brethren cultist played an important role in British Mandate Palestine. Colonel Charles Wingate was a leading figure in Darby’s sect and ensured that his son, Colonel Orde Wingate, would follow in his father’s shoes as a deviant imperialist and Christian Zionist. Orde Wingate worked closely with Christopher Sykes (son of Mark Sykes of Sykes-Picot fame) and was sent to British Mandate Palestine in 1935 to train Zionist paramilitary groups. He created a network of elite ‘Night Squads’ working in tandem with [Jabotinsky’s Haganah paramilitary group.](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah) [As demonstrated by the pioneering work of Steven P. Meyer,](https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2009/eirv36n03-20090123/eirv36n03-20090123_036-netanyahus_godfather_how_british.pdf) Vladimir Jabotinsky was a British intelligence asset from Ukraine who was groomed in the Freemasonic Young Turk operation set into motion by Lord Palmerston and Giuseppe Mazzini in the 1840s. He was a Jewish fascist admirer who Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, called “Vladimir Hitler” due to his adoption of Nazi practices and his rabidly racist ethnonationalist attitude. In a letter to his cousin, [Orde wrote](https://larouchepub.com/pr/site_packages/2002/sharon/dec2000brit_darbyites.html): “The Jews are loyal to the Empire… Palestine is essential to our Empire – our Empire is essential to England – England is essential to world peace. We have the chance to plant here in Palestine and Transjordan a loyal, rich and intelligent nation, with which we can hold for us the key to world domination without expense or effort on our part.” It is a notable irony that Col. Orde Wingate had two very influential “pro-Arab” Orientalist cousins: 1) E.G Browne, sponsor of Al-Afghani, the spiritual father of Salafiyyism and 2) T.E. Lawrence, whose manipulation of Bedouin Hashemite tribes drove the British Empire’s first ‘Arab Spring’ against the weak Ottoman Empire during World War I. British Mandate Palestine Grand Mullah Haj Amin [ frequently collaborated with British intelligence](https://cynthiachung.substack.com/p/nazis-the-british-and-the-middle) from Britain’s Cairo office, including the Muslim Brotherhood, to 1) assassinate moderate Arabs seeking economic cooperation with the Jews and 2) kill Jews to stoke revenge sentiments similar to the earlier programme of keeping Protestant vs. Catholic wars ablaze in Europe. Haj Amin’s story as a British asset and provocateur is told in full by Cynthia Chung in her book ‘ [The Empire in Which the Black Sun Never Set](https://canadianpatriot.org/untold-history-of-canada-books/)’. [ [4]] British intelligence’s support of Islamist cults throughout the Arab world, from al-Afghani (founder of Salafyyism) [to the Muslim Brotherhood,](https://vigilantcitizenforums.com/threads/muslim-brotherhood-connection-with-the-british-freemasons-dr-raslan-documented.9551/) and their simultaneous support of the most fascist and violent Zionist ideologues should not be seen as contradictory in any way. Rather, this support is united by one firm principle: maintain global dominance for the Church of the British Empire. With a game so dirty, one shouldn’t be surprised to discover that Wingate’s [fellow British intelligence agent](https://archive.org/details/secret-agent-666-spence-crowley) and self-professed satanist Aleister Crowley himself [emerged out of Darby’s Plymouth Brethren sect.](https://julesevans.medium.com/crowleys-children-d1eb234c050) Mystery Babylon from a New Lens Plymouth Brethren grand strategist George Hawkins Pember (1837-1910) is known as one of the most influential of Darby’s sect. His works on ancient mystery cults, Zionism, prophecy, and even alien interpretations of scripture have done an incredible amount of damage in shaping imperial strategic planning for over 150 years. In his book ‘ [The Antichrist, Babylon, and the Coming of the Kingdom](https://therabbithole.wiki/mystery-babylon-the-great-and-the-mysteries-and-catholicism-an-exposition-of-revelation-17-and-18-and-an-account-of-the-rise-of-the-roman-catholic-church-under-pagan-influences-by-g-h-pember-1941/)’, Pember laid out the challenge of interpreting what the “Whore of Babylon” might be. This information is very important for anyone wishing to calculate the days until the End Times. Pember followed the Pre-Millennial Dispensationalist line by extracting the cataclysmic events into the future. “It would seem, that Babylon must be rebuilt and become again the centre of the world and the glory of kingdoms, as we have it represented in the eighteenth chapter of the apocalypse,” he wrote. But who is this Babylon that must rise to power to usher in the End Times? Is it Russia? Is it the papacy? Is it the British Empire? Or is it something else? As a devout Christian Zionist cut from the cloth of Palmerston, Churchill, or Eichmann, the answer is clear, according to Pember. In his book ‘The Antichrist, Babylon, and the Coming of the Kingdom’, he wrote: “The wonder is that the restoration of Babylon has never yet been attempted … As soon, however, as Christendom is united in the form of the Ten Confederate Kingdoms, all jealousy will be at an end, and the great prize may then be seized for the common good. No doubt commerce will be the exciting motive: the civilised world will, perhaps, combine to build a great central emporium, which by their united exertions will quickly surpass all other cities, and finally become the capital of the Antichrist.” Keeping in mind the role of the Plymouth Brethren and gnostic intelligence operatives of the Palestinian Expedition Fund in creating Zionism in the first place, let’s review once more the region proclaimed by Herzl, Jabotinsky, and other Greater Zionists as the divine land ordained by God’s covenant for the “chosen people”… Today, the Anglo-Zionist project has grown from an aggressively demonic foetus to a vicious, full-grown monster. It appears intent on fulfilling a divine prophecy to recreate a new Babylon while provoking a war with literally every Arab neighbour surrounding them. The maps of Babylon 539 BCE and Herzl’s fantasy are eerily similar. America’s nuclear arsenal will likely support Zionist ambitions to purge the land of Arabs, starting with Palestine and followed by Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, and possibly Saudi Arabia, as outlined by the [neo-con Clean Break Doctrine](https://canadianpatriot.org/2023/11/29/the-clean-break-doctrine-a-modern-day-sykes-picot-waging-war-and-havoc-in-the-middle-east-2/) submitted to Netanyahu in 1996. But are all Americans (or even Israelis) happy about this scenario? Judging from the mass protests in the US against Netanyahu’s current war and the collapse of his support within Israel itself, the answer is no. But do the voices of the people who will be exterminated in the wake of a global nuclear war have any influence over the decisions made by imperial ideologues marching about Washington, London or Tel Aviv? That remains to be seen. I would also pose the question: Is it at all possible that the forces that birthed the Zionist project may ultimately see their creation as a disposable pawn in the great game? Is it also possible that these same forces don’t even see the US as a permanent fixture of the “end of history” some imperialists wish to see emerge onto the scene? These are just a few questions to ponder. With all of this in mind, it is worth revisiting [Henry Kissinger’s 2012 prophecy](https://infiniteunknown.net/2012/10/05/henry-kissinger-in-10-years-there-will-be-no-more-israel/) that “in 10 years, there will be no more Israel.” Footnotes: [4] Specifically Chapter 11: “ [Nazis, the British, and the Middle East.”](https://cynthiachung.substack.com/p/nazis-the-british-and-the-middle) Part 6, and the final part, in our series is the sections of [Ehret’s essay](https://canadianpatriot.org/2023/12/21/sir-henry-kissinger-midwife-to-new-babylon/) titled ‘The Fall of Babylon 2.0?’, ‘Kissinger’s Role as a Midwife to Satan’ and ‘Kissinger’s Devotion to the British Empire Means More Than You Think’.

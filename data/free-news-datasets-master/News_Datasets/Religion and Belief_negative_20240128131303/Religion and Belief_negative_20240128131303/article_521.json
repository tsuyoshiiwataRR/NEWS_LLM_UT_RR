However, the offences do not appear to be hate crimes or motivated by hate, Durham Regional Police said in a press release on Thursday. The police identified the man as Jagdish Pandher from Brampton city. According to the press release, in the early hours of October 8, police responded to a break-and-enter at a Hindu temple in the area of Bayly Street and Krosno Boulevard in Pickering. Pandher was seen on security surveillance breaking into the temple and taking a large quantity of cash from the donation boxes. He fled the area before police arrival, it said. He was ''seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax,'' the release said. Police say the suspect has been linked to numerous other break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year. ''These break-and-enters occurred in Durham Region and around the Greater Toronto Area,'' they said. Pandher has been charged with four counts of break-and-enter among other charges, the release said.

    "text": "Last Updated on December 28, 2023 Since the October 7th attack against Israel by Hamas, Zionists have been pressuring the American public to support the war with possible U.S. intervention. PragerU, a neoconservative, Jewish-owned and operated “educational” resource, posted on X that anti-Zionism is antisemitism, leaving no unprejudiced stances against the foreign policy agenda that serves Israel. Anti-Zionism = Antisemitism — PragerU (@prageru) [December 28, 2023] [Related: Dennis Prager Says Bisexuality is ‘The Norm’](https://nationalfile.com/dennis-prager-says-bisexuality-is-the-norm/) The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which many [Jewish conservatives have rebuked as “leftists” and not “Jewish,”](https://townhall.com/columnists/brianpfail/2023/09/11/column-n2628215) has longed to establish anti-Zionism as antisemitism in accordance with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). [Its working definition](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism) is certainly broad and, of course, includes anti-Zionism. This conflating of anti-Zionism with antisemitism has been the ultimate crutch for the Zionist agenda, although [support for US intervention continues to dwindle](https://nationalfile.com/corporate-media-targets-social-media-amid-falling-support-for-israel/) despite corporate media’s unabashed cheerleading. Recall only a few months ago, during the #BanTheADL campaign, this appeared as a censorship problem. The Daily Wire’s Ben Shapiro ushered a space with Elon Musk and nine Jewish leaders to discuss “antisemitism, faith and free speech.” The two-hour space was purely dedicated to antisemitism, as the nine explicitly told the owner of X that he simply didn’t understand the “sensitively of the Jewish people.” Here's an edited version of the [@benshapiro] [@elonmusk]space on Antisemitism and free speech. This version removes the long pause at the beginning, weird transitions, pauses, etc. This version is ~30% shorter and flows better. Thanks [@DavidCarbutt_]and team for the work! [pic.twitter.com/Me2koBqJKN] — Farzad (@farzyness) [September 29, 2023] Rabbi Menachem Margolin of the European Jewish Association (EJA) insisted on the IHRA’s working definition and for the billionaire to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp to demonstrate “antisemitism and what it could lead to.” Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Associate Dean and Director of Global Social Action for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, then pressured Musk further on the “nuanced” definition. Cooper even claimed the Holocaust could happen again through “organized hate, a crisis, and technology …” Musk agreed with the working definition but hasn’t implemented such a policy. It would essentially eliminate all opposition to the Zionists and the war in the Middle East that doesn’t have a drip of American agenda. Anti-Zionism is antisemitism. — Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) [October 23, 2023] This is pure, unadulterated abuse of power by a particular interest group and their compadres, making them and their concerns, including American foreign policy, immune to all criticism and any true public discourse. There are multiple Jewish anti-Zionist NGOs that promoted the idea of an “ [antisemitic racket](https://townhall.com/columnists/brianpfail/2023/09/23/orthodox-jews-expose-zionist-antisemitism-racket-of-adl-n2628846).” Still, their funding is minimal compared to Zionist nonprofits. [Related: Establishment Crucifies Musk Over Jewish Antiwhitism Post](https://nationalfile.com/establishment-crucifies-musk-over-jewish-antiwhitism-post/) There is also the fact that most Republicans are neoconservatives, an ideology that began primarily as a Jewish movement pitching [Israel as “morally exceptional.”](https://lobelog.com/neoconservativism-in-a-nutshell/) So, it is very likely that the IHRA’s working definition will be implemented in the future, especially due to the conflict in the Middle East and its growing negative appeal to the American public.",

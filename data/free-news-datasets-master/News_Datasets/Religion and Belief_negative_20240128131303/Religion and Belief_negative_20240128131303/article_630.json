    "text": "- By [Anushka Vats](/authors/anushka-vats) - Updated: Fri, 29 Dec 2023 03:50 PM (IST) - Source:JND A 41-year-old Indo-Canadian man has been arrested for many thefts and break-ins at Hindu temples located in the Durham Region and Greater Toronto Area of Canada, reported PTI, citing a police official. However, Durham Regional Police stated in a press release on Thursday that the offenses don't seem to be hate crimes or driven by hatred. The accused man has been identified as Jagdish Pandher from Brampton City. The incident took place in the early hours of October 8 and the police responded to a break-and-enter at a Hindu temple in the area of Bayly Street and Krosno Boulevard in Pickering. Pandher was caught on camera breaking into the temple and taking a huge sum of money from the donation boxes. He left the scene before the cops arrived, said the press release. He was \"seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax,\" the release said. According to the police, the suspect has been linked to numerous other break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year. \"These break-and-enters occurred in Durham Region and around the Greater Toronto Area,\" they said, as quoted by PTI. According to the release, Pandher is accused of breaking and entering on four separate occasions.

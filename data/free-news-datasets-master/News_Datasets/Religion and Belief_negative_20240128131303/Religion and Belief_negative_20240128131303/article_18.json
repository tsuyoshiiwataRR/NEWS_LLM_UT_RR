    "text": "A Louisiana woman has [filed](https://lailluminator.com/2023/12/27/chalmette-woman-files-suit-to-keep-trump-off-louisiana-ballot-report/) a state lawsuit with the goal of kicking Donald Trump off the state‚Äôs March 23rd Republican presidential ballot. Presented simply as a Louisiana citizen by establishment news outlets, Ashley Reeb is, in fact, a self-described ‚Äúneocommunist‚Äù and member of St. Bernard Parish Democrat Executive Committee. Reeb‚Äôs lawsuit, filed on December 22nd, claims: ‚ÄúBoth Trump‚Äôs actions (engaging in insurrection) as well as his inaction (giving aid and comfort to insurrectionists) on Jan. 6, 2021, disqualify him from holding any office of/under the United States.‚Äù Ms. Reeb‚Äôs legal claims echo those dismissed by state supreme courts in [Minnesota](https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/11/08/minnesota-supreme-court-dismisses-suit-calling-for-trump-to-be-barred-from-ballot/) and [Michigan](https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/12/27/winning-michigan-supreme-court-rejects-trump-ballot-ban-case-brought-by-soros-hamas-linked-group/). According to her LinkedIn [profile,](https://archive.ph/W1Szd) Ms. Reeb works as seasonal staff with the The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Foundation, Inc. From 1999 to 2005 she served as a part-time Administrative File Clerk with the Louisiana National Guard, and as a Deputy with the St. Bernard Parish Sheriff‚Äôs Office from 2001 to 2003. An examination of Ms. Reeb‚Äôs social media [account](https://twitter.com/DatParishGirl) on X (formerly Twitter) reveals she is a follower and reposter of a whose-who of ‚ÄòResistanceLib‚Äô accounts. Reeb herself has [pushed](https://archive.ph/UVb6e) the debunked Russiagate conspiracy theory as recently as August 21st, 2023. In addition, she has [posted](https://www.facebook.com/ashleybreeb/posts/pfbid0FNzKaLSQz4Q81EghpNJWm5cLqbH5aaCzYFFZ5TJpKVwE1YneRg7Lo2E3E5yyFUqul) pro-Hamas propaganda on her Facebook page, claiming Israeli hostages were well treated by their Hamas terrorist captors and even ‚Äòthanked‚Äô them ‚Äì with additional claims it is Israelis who have engaged in mass kidnappings of Palestinians. According to local [reports](https://thehayride.com/2023/12/meet-the-insane-chalmette-leftist-suing-to-keep-trump-off-the-louisiana-ballot/), Ms. Reeb flies both a transgender flag and a Black Lives Matter flag outside her home. \"They KNOW he is a fucking prolific criminal, and they are mostly too chickenshit to call him out for it.\" Simple answer: Russian kompromat. The RNC was hacked when the DNC was. Interestingly, that's about the time when they all fell in line ü§î [https://t.co/JzuktoEQag] ‚Äî Ash (@DatParishGirl) [August 21, 2023]",

    "text": "Sorcery accusations in 2023 rose to an all-time high as 400 people were accused of sorcery with religion now used to raise accusations against others.\nAnd from the 400 about 65 people accused of sorcery were killed.\nThe statistics were presented by the Parliamentary Committee on Gender Based Violence Chairman Powes Parkop to parliament early this year.\nThe data was collected from an Inquiry conducted by the Committee.\nHowever, among all the accusations, the tortures, the videos, and the pictures, the churches have now been pulled into the sinister world of Sorcery with some of the accusers quoting scriptures and accusing women and the vulnerable as those practicing witchcraft.\nAnd one of the cases covered extensively by the Post-Courier was the story of mother of five Lorna Nico.\nNico was a woman from Sohe, Northern Province who fell in love with a man from Mumeng, Morobe province, left her family behind and started a family with her husband and his people.\nThey were happy until the end of August of this year.\nAs her 8-year-old watched, Lorna was stripped and tortured dying of her injuries and then her body left out to the elements of the sun and insects until the evening when her body was removed and buried.\nShe was identified after a ‘prayer warrior” from one of the churches accused her of having satanic powers and bringing bad luck to the community.\nLorna didn’t know this woman nor was she part of the church the woman was from.\nHowever, she was pointed out allegedly because she was from another province.\nBishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church Reverand Jack Urame spoke about the dangers\nof “mixing religion and sorcery”.\n“This is not what the bible taught us, there is a shift in people using Christianity to identify suspected sorcerers which was now being used to destroy families and commit murders.”\nUsing Christianity as a means to enact killings against those accused of sorcery is an idea condemned by the churches,” he further stated.\nBut the voice of a leader of a church is worrying because PNG has been declared by the government as a Christian nation.\nAs a nation much is still needed to be done in terms of ridding accusations of sorcery and killings associated with sorcery.\nIn the city of Port Moresby, a man who had cancer recently died with his family accusing a relative of causing his mouth cancer by giving him betelnut that was tainted.\nThis result in the burning of homes and the assault of one man who was only a neighbor to\nthe accused.\nSpeaking to those who live in the community it was surprising that the support was given to the relatives of the deceased.\nNot even the church was spared, as the deceased relatives accused the church of interfering in a matter, they knew nothing off.\nChristianity continues to be the belief across the country but when it becomes part of the sorcery accusations, police are worried with the rise in such accusations using the church.\nPolice Commissioner David Manning said; “It is sickening to see these profiteers of death now calling themselves prayer warriors, misusing mainstream Christian faith for their brutal and bloody ends.\n“One of the most effective ways of preventing these sorcery crimes is through police working with community leaders and churches.”’\n“Glasman or glasmeris” used their connections to churches to accuse those they believed were practicing witchcraft.\n“Police are targeting glasmen, glasmeris and prayer warriors, and stopping these criminals is an important part of law enforcement relating to sorcery.”\nPolice are working with churches and community groups to provide more effective safe houses once survivors and their families escape or are rescued, he added.\nFor now, more needs to be done in the fight against sorcery.",

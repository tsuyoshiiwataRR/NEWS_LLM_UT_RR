    "text": "There may be as many as 15 million Arabic-speaking Christians living in the Middle East, and they, along with their indigenous Jewish brothers and sisters, had prospered there in relative peace for centuries. Discrimination and violence against these two “religions of the book” did not increase significantly until the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the 19th century.\nAbout 63% of American Arabs practice Christianity of one creed or the other. In the 19th century, their ancestors immigrated to the U.S. from Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. Counted among these Christian Arabs are Roman Catholic (35%), Eastern Orthodox (18%) and Protestant (10%), many of whom converted after arriving in the U.S.\nAs a Rotary Fellow in Denmark in 1966, one of the first persons I met was a Palestinian Christian. I mistakenly thought that all Palestinians were Muslim, but I was even more amazed when he said, sadly, that he was stateless. It was inconceivable to me that any person would not have a country to call his or her own.",

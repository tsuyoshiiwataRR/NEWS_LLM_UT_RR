    "text": "Barbara L. Harshman\nBarbara Lee Harshman, 92, of Charles Town, went to be with the Lord on Saturday, December 23, 2023, following a brief illness. Surrounded by her loving family, she was a patient at Reston Medical Center at the time of her death.\nBorn August 8, 1931 in Wilmington, Delaware, she was the daughter of Carroll Pearl and Gladys Mae Scherer Pearl. As a child, she enjoyed spending summers with her Aunt Cora and Uncle Roy Gross in Burkittsville, MD.\nBarbara graduated from Frederick High School in MD, Class of 1950. She married Lloyd Harshman, of Frederick, on September 22, 1951. They began their life together in Daisy, MD. In 1967, they moved their family to Drilake Farm in Jefferson County, WV, where she has enjoyed living for 56 years.\nBarbara was a homemaker who lovingly raised four children. She was an extremely hard-working person who not only tended her own home, but also cleaned houses for others for many years.\nShe was a long-time member of Kabletown United Methodist Church, where she taught adult and children’s Sunday school, held the position of Sunday school superintendent and was an occasional lay leader. She also baked the bread for holy Communion. After the closure of Kabletown Church, she found a new church family in Marvin Chapel, Berryville, VA, where she enjoyed greeting her friends every Sunday.\nShe loved cooking and entertaining for family and friends, old movies, big band music, Sunday dinners and her bible study groups throughout the years. She was a Christian who lived her life unselfishly and was kind and generous to everyone. She will be sorely missed by all who knew her.\nShe is survived by a son, Lloyd “Skip” Harshman Jr., of Inwood; two daughters, Linda Nicodemus, of Inwood; Sharon Snyder and husband, Charles, of Bunker Hill; three grandsons, Jason Harshman, of Nampa, ID, Adam Harshman, of Simi Valley, CA and Evan Snyder, of Bunker Hill; and three great-granddaughters, Riley, Devin and Paislee Harshman.\nIn addition to her parents and husband, she was preceded in death by a son, Carroll Harshman; a sister, Patricia Russo; an infant brother, Leon Pearl; a nephew, Mike Russo and a son-in-law, Perry “Sonny” Nicodemus.\nIn keeping with her final wishes, a brief graveside service will be held at 11:00 a.m. on Thursday, Jan. 4, at Rosedale Cemetery, 917 Cemetery Road, Martinsburg, WV. The Rev. Kenneth Patrick will officiate.\nCondolences may be sent to\nwww.RosedaleFuneral.com",

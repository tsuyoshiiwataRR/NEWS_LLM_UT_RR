    "text": "Israa Farhan Pakistan has banned New Year's celebrations in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, announced the government on Thursday, urging citizens to observe \"simple\" forms of festivities.\nIn a televised message to the nation, Prime Minister Anwar ul Haq Kakar stated that due to the situation in Gaza, the government has \"completely banned all types of New Year's celebration activities.\"\nThe conflict between Israel and Hamas erupted on October 7 following an unprecedented attack by the movement on southern Israel, resulting in the deaths of around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to a count by AFP based on the latest Israeli official figures.\nThe attack also led to the taking of about 250 hostages, with 129 of them still held in Gaza , according to Israel.\nSince then, Israel has carried out intense shelling of Gaza and initiated ground operations starting on October 27, resulting in over 21,000 casualties, most of whom are women and children, according to the Ministry of Health controlled by Hamas.\nKakar stated on Thursday that \"the entire Pakistani nation and the Muslim world deeply mourn the genocide of oppressed Palestinians, especially the massacre of innocent children in Gaza and the West Bank.\"\nPakistan typically celebrates New Year's Eve with fireworks and a bank holiday on January 1.\nOn Thursday, the Emirate of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates also banned the launching of fireworks on New Year's Eve due to the war in Gaza.",

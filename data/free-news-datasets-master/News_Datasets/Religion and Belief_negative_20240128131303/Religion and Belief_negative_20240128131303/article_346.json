    "text": "India\nThe message \"Rebuild Babri Masjid 6 December\" was sprayed on the first floor of the School of Language 2 building, along with the name \"NSUI\"\nThe walls of Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) were damaged with messages urging the reconstruction of the Babri Masjid ahead of the big Ram Mandir consecration ceremony slated for January 22 in Ayodhya.\nThe message \"Rebuild Babri Masjid 6 December\" was sprayed on the first floor of the School of Language 2 building, along with the name \"NSUI\" (National Students' Union of India).\nOn social media on Thursday, images of the graffiti went viral. A dispute has been raised by the text on the campus wall that is purportedly credited to NSUI. The message was not written by group members, according to the student body, who have denied any involvement.\nThe students' union has aggressively denounced such attitudes, claiming that this message is part of a larger plot to discredit both the college and NSUI.\nNSUI has also demanded that the varsity administration investigate the situation thoroughly.\nIt's not the first time that a graffiti has been found on JNU's walls. Similar incidents occurred in October of this year when messages such as \"Free Kashmir,\" \"Teri Kabra Khudegi\"and \"Bhagwa Jalega\" were sprayed on the University building's walls.\nNext month, in January 2024, the Ram temple is scheduled to be inaugurated. The January 22 ceremony, which a number of well-known figures, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend.\nAccording to Ram Temple Trust general secretary Champat Rai, some 2,200 additional guests and almost 4,000 saints have been invited to the celebration.\nMajor temple leaders such as Kashi Vishwanath and Vaishno Devi, along with representatives from religious and constitutional establishments, spiritual guide Dalai Lama, Keralan Mata Amritanandamayi, and yoga master Baba Ramdev, have also been invited.",

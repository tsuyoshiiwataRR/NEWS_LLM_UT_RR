    "text": "FALL RIVER, Mass. â€” The Board at Temple Beth El has decided to sell their synagogue in Fall River and move to a smaller location within the city. Rabbi Mark Elber told NBC 10 the congregation doesn't have enough members to sustain it. \"There are a few leaks in the roof, it's a building that's 95-years-old,\" said Rabbi Elber. He said the board, which is not connected to Temple Beth El in Providence, made a unanimous decision to sell the Fall River Synagogue. Rabbi Elber has been at the Fall River Synagogue since 2013. \"I don't know what will happen, but I hate to think of it being torn down, it would be incredibly sad,\" he said. The High St. Location has been a place of peace for the Jewish population in Bristol County and beyond. \"All of these small towns around here, we draw from them, but right now it's not enough,\" he said. Rabbi Elver said when he first arrived in 2013, there were about 250 members. Now, he said there's about 50 active members. Although the number is too low to maintain the building, he said it's not too low to maintain the congregation. \"That's our main priority,\" he said. \"So even though we won't have this building, nevertheless we will find another space,\" said Elber. The Rabbi told NBC 10 he still has hope for the High St. location, as a commuter rail could bring new residents and a generous person could potentially step forward to save the only synagogue left in the city. \"There are people here who have been here their entire lives,\" said Rabbi Elber. \"Their grandparents were here, so they grew up in this place, they like to sit in the seats they sat in with their grandparents,\" he said. Elber said any potential donors could reach out to the board.",

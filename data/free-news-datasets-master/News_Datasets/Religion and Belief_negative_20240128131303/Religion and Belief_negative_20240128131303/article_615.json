    "text": "Nicaraguan police arrested two more Catholic priests on Thursday, a source familiar with the case said. The new arrests bring to at least six the number of clerics imprisoned in the past week. The source, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of being arrested, said the two priests are being held for publicly praying for the release of Rolando Alvarez, bishop of the diocese of Matagalpa, who is highly critical of President Daniel Ortega and is also imprisoned.\nAccording to local media outlet Confidencial , they are Carlos Aviles, vicar general of Managua, and Hector Treminio , treasurer of the same diocese. In a homily in 2020, he reportedly criticized the Ortega family's enrichment, accusing them of being \" the biggest capitalists (in) the country .\" \" Aren't they the ones who were supposed to take care of the poor, and now they drive around in $240,000 cars? Where is the slogan for the poor?\" he claimed at the time.\nTheir arrest would bring to at least six the number of priests detained in the past week, two of whom have already been released, the media outlet said. Contacted by Reuters , the government's press office did not immediately respond.\nThe Catholic Church Targeted In recent years, the government of Daniel Ortega, who was re-elected in November 2021 for a fourth consecutive term, has targeted members of the Catholic Church. A few days before Christmas, police arrested Bishop Isidro Mora of the diocese of Siuna, the second bishop to be detained after Bishop Alvarez.\nRolando Alvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa, who had sharply criticized the government's deadly response to the 2018 mass protests demanding Ortega's departure, has been in captivity for more than 500 days. He was convicted of treason in early 2023 and sentenced to 26 years in prison.\nAccording to local media, many of the recently detained clerics were arrested for publicly praying for Bishop Alvarez's release. Nicaraguan Bishop Silvio Baez, who has been living in exile in Florida since 2019, called for the priests to be released. \" I ask God to protect them and that they be released immediately!\" he posted on December 28 on X .",

    "text": "A 41-year-old Indo-Canadian man has been arrested for multiple break-ins and thefts at Hindu temples in Canada's Durham Region and Greater Toronto Area, police said.\nImage only for representation. Photograph: Blair Gable/Reuters However, the offences do not appear to be hate crimes or motivated by hate, Durham Regional Police said in a press release on Thursday.\nThe police identified the man as Jagdish Pandher from Brampton city.\n According to the press release, in the early hours of October 8, police responded to a break-and-enter at a Hindu temple in the area of Bayly Street and Krosno Boulevard in Pickering.\nPandher was seen on security surveillance breaking into the temple and taking a large quantity of cash from the donation boxes. He fled the area before police arrival, it said.\nHe was 'seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax', the release said.\nPolice say the suspect has been linked to numerous other break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year.\n\"These break-and-enters occurred in Durham Region and around the Greater Toronto Area,\" they said.\nPandher has been charged with four counts of break-and-enter among other charges, the release said.",

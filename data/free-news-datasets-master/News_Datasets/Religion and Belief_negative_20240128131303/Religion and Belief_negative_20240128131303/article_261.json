    "text": "Pro-life protestors rally as abortion services resume in Sheboygan SHEBOYGAN, Wis. (WBAY) - Pro-life advocates held a prayer rally outside of the Planned Parenthood clinic in Sheboygan after the facility resumed abortion health care services Thursday. PPWI says Dane County Circuit Court Judge Diane Schlipper [made a ruling](https://www.wbay.com/2023/12/06/planned-parenthood-wisconsin-plans-resume-abortion-services-sheboygan-after-court-ruling/) earlier this month that reaffirmed a previous decision which said statute 940.04 (Wisconsin’s 1849 law on abortion) does not apply to consensual abortion care. Pro-life groups objected to the ruling. Those taking part in the prayer rally believe abortion services claim innocent lives. “They will never have a voice, so we must be the voice for them,” said Dan Miller, the State Director of Pro-Life Wisconsin. Miller said he is hopeful about an appeal of the judge’s ruling, made by Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski. Meanwhile, Dr. Kristin Lyerly, an OB-GYN, who previously independently contracted at the Sheboygan clinic, says she doesn’t believe the ruling will be overturned. “People need health care,” said Dr. Lyerly. “People have the same kinds of needs they deserve access, they deserve support, they deserve resources, and that’s not what politicians in Wisconsin are giving them right now.” Representatives from Planned Parenthood say patients can now make appointments at the Sheboygan location. PREVIOUS REPORT: Abortion health care services resume at Planned Parenthood’s Sheboygan Health Center Thursday. Now, the location joins two others already offering abortions again in Milwaukee and Madison. PPWI says Dane County Circuit Court Judge Diane Schlipper [made a ruling](https://www.wbay.com/2023/12/06/planned-parenthood-wisconsin-plans-resume-abortion-services-sheboygan-after-court-ruling/) earlier this month that reaffirmed a previous decision which said statute 940.04 (Wisconsin’s 1849 law on abortion) does not apply to consensual abortion care. Pro-life groups objected to the ruling. Both sides are responding to medication abortions restarting. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin’s President and CEO Tanya Atkinson said, “Being able to provide this essential care at another health center is important to the health and well-being of Wisconsin women and people across the gender spectrum who need care.” Non-profit Pro-Life Wisconsin is holding an anti-abortion rally outside Planned Parenthood in Sheboygan in response. The group’s social media post announcing the rally and prayer gathering says, “Our hope is to attempt to open the hearts and minds of both abortion workers and pregnant mothers. Help us to keep the unborn alive and unharmed.” Planned Parenthood representatives say schedules are open for patients to book appointments at the Sheboygan location right now. The rally is set to begin at 10:30 a.m. Copyright 2023 WBAY. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "NEW DELHI: Karnataka's chief minister on Thursday sparked a controversy by saying that there is a difference between 'Hindu' and 'Hindutva'. In a recent address at the 139th Congress Foundation Day in Bengaluru, the CM said that while the state respects and practices Hindu traditions like worshipping Ram and organizing Ram Bhajans, the version of Hindutva espoused by the BJP is inauthentic.The chief minister criticized the BJP, Jan Sangh, RSS, and Sangh Parivar for their lack of participation in the Indian freedom struggle, contrasting this with the Congress party's significant role in it. He urged people to recognize and spread awareness about the BJP's falsehoods.Siddaramaiah highlighted the Congress party's achievements post-independence, citing the construction of dams during Nehru's tenure and attributing the expansion of the internet in India to late PM Rajiv Gandhi. He accused the BJP of being adept in spreading lies.He asserted that social justice in India is a result of the Congress party's efforts. The CM expressed confidence in the party's future successes, mentioning Rahul Gandhi's upcoming padayatra and his potential to lead the country as the next Prime Minister.",

    "text": "2023-12-29 15:11:15\nIstanbul- Turkey has arrested 29 people who planned to attack mosques and synagogues, the Interior Ministry said. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said that 29 people suspected of having links with the IS group were detained in nine provinces.\nSocial media platform Xil Yerlikaya said the suspects caught in Operation Heroes 37 were planning to attack mosques and synagogues in Istanbul.\nApart from them, three senior IS members were also arrested, Turkeyâ€™s official Anadolu news agency reported, citing security sources. According to the report, one of the arrested was planning to attack the Iraqi embassy in Ankara. The news agency did not provide any further information about the suspects or their activities.\nTurkey has tightened its crackdown on IS and Kurdish activists since a Kurdish militant bombed near government buildings in Ankara on October 1. The arrests come as part of ongoing efforts to combat terrorism and protect the safety and security of the country.\nThe Interior Ministry has urged the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities. The government is committed to preventing any acts of terrorism and ensuring the safety of its citizens and visitors.\n#people #arrested #planning #attack #mosques #synagogues #Connection",

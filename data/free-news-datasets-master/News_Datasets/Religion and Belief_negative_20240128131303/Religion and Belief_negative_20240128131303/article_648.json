    "text": "Training guns at the Bhartiya Janata party for using Ram Mandir as an 'instrument for political gain', Sitaram Yechury called the inauguration of the temple a 'state-sponsored function'.\n\"The CPI(M) policy has been to respect religious beliefs & safeguarding the right of every individual to pursue their belief. Religion is a personal choice not to be converted into an instrument for political gain. This is a state-sponsored function in presence of PM & UP CM,\" he said in a post on X.\nThe CPI (M) leader in a post on X announced that he will not be attending the inauguration ceremony of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.\n\"It is most unfortunate that the BJP and RSS have converted a religious ceremony into a state sponsored event, directly involving the Prime Minister, the UP Chief Minister and other Government functionaries,\" said an official circular issued by the party.\nHe further said that a Supreme Court principle which says that a state should have no religious affiliation, is being violated under the ruling regime in the organization in the event.\nSitharam Yechury while speaking to media said, \"Nripendra Mishra was escorted by a VHP leader who came and gave me the invitation. Religion is a personal choice of every individual. We respect and safeguard the right of every individual to choose their particular form of faith\".\nUnion Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia expressed disappointment on CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury denying to visit Ayodhya despite being invited for the 'Pran Pratishtha' of the Ram Janmabhoomi.\n\"I am amazed because as someone who's name has both Sita and Ram, being absent from the ceremony will be very unfortunate,\" said Scindia.\nMeanwhile, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh confirmed that Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Congress Parliamentary Party Chairperson Sonia Gandhi have received an invitation to attend the consecration ceremony of Ram Temple on 22nd January 2024 in Ayodhya. Jairam Ramesh said the decision on attedning the ceremony will be taken and communicated at the appropriate time.\nEarlier Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram and CWC member Shashi Tharoor said that attending the consecration ceremony of Lord Ram in Ayodhya was an individual choice.\n\"Going to a temple is an individual decision. Individuals have been invited, let them make their own decisions. To my mind, a temple is absolutely not a political stage, it is a place for people to contemplate the divine and do their prayers and it is a personal choice. Individuals have been invited and letting individuals decide if they wish to go is my stand\" Tharoor said on Thursday. (ANI)",

    "text": "PETALING JAYA: DAP MP Datuk Ngeh Koo Ham’s proposal for a non-Muslim expert to be included in the special Syariah law committee is baseless, says Datuk Dr Mohd Na’im Mokhtar ( pic ).\nThe Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Religious Affairs) Minister said in a statement on Friday (Dec 29) that a special committee had already been established to review the competency of the state assemblies to draft Syariah laws.\nThe committee, he said, already had its first meeting on Dec 5 on issues related to the competency of the state assembly and the jurisdiction of the Syariah courts as provided by the Federal Constitution.\nALSO READ: Ngeh's statement on appointment of non-Muslim was an oversight, says Loke\nThe committee was headed by former chief justice Tun Zaki Tun Azmi and comprises experts including former federal court judges, representatives from the Attorney General Chambers, legal practitioners, representatives from the state religious department and academics.\n\"All members appointed to the committee are experts in the Federal Constitution, civil law as well as Shariah law and are qualified to study and provide views and proposals on the best and harmonious solution for all issues that has arisen to strengthen the Syariah law and judiciary system in the country,\" he said.\nALSO READ: Appointing non-Muslim experts in the Syariah committee will spark controversy, says Umno's secretary-general\nHe added the findings and proposals of the committee would also be brought to the Conference of Rulers and the National Council for Islamic Religious Affairs Malaysia (MKI).\n\"Therefore, the Beruas MP’s proposal for the appointment of a non-Muslim expert in the special committee has no basis,\" he said.\nHe said the religious affairs ministry handled the matters related to the administration of Islamic affairs and would always refer to the MKI and state religious affairs authorities.\nALSO READ: Beruas MP has gone overboard with his statement, says Bersatu\nTherefore, he urged all parties to refrain from making statements that could spark public concern.\nHe also called all parties to have full confidence and give the special committee space to conduct its role professionally and effectively.\nOpen Modal ×",

    "text": "Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy doubled down on his war against “wokeism,” linking it with “transgenderism, climatism” and “covidism” as the cornerstones of an insidious plot to undermine the American dream — a plot that he beieves only he can defeat. “I see a Republican party that has grown lazy,” Ramaswamy told a small crowd of about 20 people at Lincoln’s Pub in Council Bluffs on Thursday, the first of nine scheduled campaign stops for the day. “I don't just mean lazy in the ‘get out the vote operation’ sense of lazy. I mean lazy in defining who we are and what we even stand for,\" Ramaswamy continued. \"The left is very good at this. I mean, they don't give you the right vision, but they'll give you a vision: race, gender, sexuality, climate.\" He said the Republican Party has \"grown lazy to just sit here criticizing what they put up, but without offering our own vision of what we actually stand for: individuals, family, nation, God. That beats race, gender, sexuality and climate if we have the courage to actually stand for something.\" People are also reading… Ramaswamy added: \"We can't anymore just be the party that is running from something. We gotta be running to something, to our vision of what it means to be an American today.” Ramaswamy stands for an isolationist “America First” policy, echoing the words of former President Donald Trump and others who have used the slogan. Ramaswamy referred to the Ukrainian defense against Russian invasion as “a pointless foreign war,” suggesting he would no longer aid the nation’s allies against neighboring aggressors. Ramaswamy, said he would send U.S. military forces to both the northern and southern borders to stop people from entering the United States without legal permission. “I can't be a father of two sons in the White House and tell them they have to follow the rules when I'm leading a government that isn't following its own rules,” he said. “Anybody who's in this country illegally will be returned to their country of origin.\" He cited a law he says allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents \"can deputize local law enforcement to serve their warrants. That's how we do it. Use our military to secure our own southern border.” Ramaswamy stands for a nuclear family composed of a husband and wife of opposite genders raising their children together. “Kids born in a two parent household versus a fatherless household -- that's most single parent households -- the ones in single parent households are eight times more likely to end up in jail, 10 times more likely not to graduate from high school,” Ramaswamy said. “Right now we are paying single mothers more money not to have a man in the house then to have a man in the house, teaching them to be married to Uncle Sam instead of that other guy who was in their house. That's what we're incentivizing, actually,” he added. Ramaswamy also believes that “the best person no longer gets the job,” calling it “the death of meritocracy,” which is a political ideology that believes that people should be rewarded based solely on talent and effort — without considering how wealth, income inequalities and other factors can impede a person’s opportunities and, thus, their achievements. “It’s based on other attributes,” he said. “Race, gender or whatever the other popular attributes are. That shrinks the success of our culture. We’re penalizing excellence.” If elected president, Ramaswamy would close a variety of government agencies, including the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the federal Department of Education. “That’s how you revive the integrity of a constitutional republic,” he said. He would fire the 20,000 “back office bureaucrats” at the FBI and fold the remaining agents into the U.S. Marshals Service or the Drug Enforcement Administration. Ramaswamy would make Election Day a federal holiday and do away with early voting. He would seek to have ballots printed only in English, and voter identification would be mandatory. “That’s not too much to ask,” he said. “This isn’t a Black or a white idea. These aren’t even Democrat or Republican ideas, not really. These are American ideals that we fought a revolution to secure in this country, and I believe, deep in my heart, that those ideals still exist. I’m running for president to revive them.” Also on the campaign trail this week is the wife of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Casey DeSantis. She will appear Friday in Atlantic at Family Table of Atlantic, 609 W. Seventh St., at 2:30 p.m., followed by Barley's at 114 W. Broadway in Council Bluffs at 4:30 p.m.",

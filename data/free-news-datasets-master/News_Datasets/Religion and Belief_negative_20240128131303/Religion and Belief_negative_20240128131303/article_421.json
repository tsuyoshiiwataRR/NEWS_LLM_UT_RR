    "text": "KOZHIKODE/KOCHI: The invitation extended to the national leadership of the Congress to attend the consecration of Ram temple in Ayodhya on January 22 has left the party's state unit divided. The outright rejection of the invite by the CPM and CPI and the state BJP leaders' jibe at the Congress to come clear on its stand has further exposed the division.Senior Congress leader and MP K Muraleedharan told reporters in Kozhikode on Thursday that the party state unit had urged the national leadership not to participate in the consecration ceremony, but KPCC president K Sudhakaran maintained that he was not aware of any such development and it was up to the national leadership to take a stand on the matter.Muraleedharan said the BJP was playing politics over the temple inauguration. \\\"Our stand is that one should not fall into their trap... The consecration of a temple is a religious matter and as head of the government, it is not appropriate for the Prime Minister to inaugurate the temple. It should be done by priests and trustees of the temple,\\\" he added.The Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulema had on Wednesday cautioned the Congress party against its leaders attending the consecration ceremony and criticised the party for holding on to its soft-Hindutva stand. The IUML, the second largest party in the UDF, also wanted the Congress to exercise caution in this regard.Sudhakaran told the media in Kannur that the KPCC could not take a stand on the matter. \\\"If the national leadership seeks the KPCC's opinion, we will convey our stand,\\\" he said. Asked about Muraleedharan's remarks, he said the question should be posed to Muraleedharan himself.Meanwhile, MP Shashi Tharoor said in Pathanamthitta that attempts were being made to make a political issue out of the invite. “Putting the Congress leadership in a box and saying if you go that means you are playing into the BJP's hands; if you don’t go that means you are anti-Hindu, this kind of thing is nonsense... Let the individuals (who have been invited) make a reasonable choice,” he said. Tharoor said the party would let them know if it took a collective decision. “Right now, three or four individuals have been invited from the party leadership and they will certainly make a decision in an appropriate manner at the appropriate time,” he said. Earlier in the day, Muraleedharan said the national leadership of the party would take a stand at the national level after taking into account the feelings of people. However, he said the Congress party could not take a stand like the CPM or CPI, which belonged to nonbelievers, while the Congress encompassed all sections including believers and non-believers. “The Samajwadi Party, which is leading the INDIA bloc in Uttar Pradesh, which has the highest number of MPs, has said it would attend the event. The Uddhav Thackeray faction of the Shiv Sena is also attending the event. We have to take a decision after considering all aspects,” he said.",

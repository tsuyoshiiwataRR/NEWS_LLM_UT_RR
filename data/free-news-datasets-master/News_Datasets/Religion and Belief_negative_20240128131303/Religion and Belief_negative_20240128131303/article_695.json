    "text": "The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has hit out against the central government for allowing the portrayal of the characters of Sahibzadas Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh in various school plays during the ‘Veer Bal Divas’ events.\nTerming such plays against Sikh principles and traditions, the SGPC has ‘sought an explanation from the CBSE, along with the Ministries of Education, Culture, and Minority Affairs of India.’\nVideos on social media show school children playing the roles of Sahibzada Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh, the younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Guru of Sikhs on the occasion of ‘Veer Bal Divas’ on December 26. The SGPC considers such plays to be against Sikh principles.\nIn a statement, SGPC president Harjinder Singh Dhami said that any anti-Sikh move cannot be accepted, as it goes against Sikh principles, customs, traditions, and values.\nDhami mentioned receiving complaints from the Sikh Sangat about children playing the characters of Sahibzades, stating, “We have asked the different ministries of the central government and CBSE to explain their stand on these plays performed in schools.”\nFor not embracing Islam, Guru Gobind Singh’s mother, Mata Gujari Ji, and his two younger sons, Zorawar Singh (9) and Fateh Singh (7), were executed at Sirhind in December 1704.\nIn January 2022, the Centre announced that December 26 would be observed as ‘Veer Bal Diwas’ to mark the martyrdom of Guru Gobind Singh’s younger sons.\nDhami said that, as per the direction from Sri Akal Takht Sahib, the SGPC had already requested the central government to change the name ‘Veer Bal Diwas,’ as it does not represent Sikh sentiments of martyrdom associated with the day. However, the government did not take it seriously, he alleged.\n“The concern of the SGPC and the Sikh Sangat regarding Veer Bal Diwas has come true when children are playing the roles of Sahibzadas. The responsibility for this anti-Sikh activity lies directly with the central government and the respective state governments. Such actions can never be accepted by the Sikh world, and action will also be taken against the educational institutions that portray the character of Sahibzadas in student plays,” said Dhami.\nAccording to the Public Information Bureau (PIB), various interactive and participative programmes were conducted leading up to the day in all schools of States/UTs and autonomous bodies under the Department of School Education and Literacy to commemorate Veer Bal Diwas.\nOver 52 lakh students, teachers and stakeholders participated in the events which included special assemblies, essay, poetry, and painting competitions, screening of short films, and stories recounting the valour of the Sahibzadas across the country.\nA digital exhibition detailing the life story and sacrifice of the Sahibzades was also displayed.",

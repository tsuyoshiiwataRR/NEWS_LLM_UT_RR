    "text": "Agartala: A day after a rally was taken out to press for the passage of an anti-conversion law to protect indigenous faiths and culture by a right wing-backed tribal organisation Janajati Surakha Mancha (JSM), Tripura royal scion Pradyot Kishore Debbarman, founder and leader of the state’s main opposition party, TIPRA Motha, on Wednesday launched a scathing attack on the tribal leaders who demanded delisting Christians from ST status.Besides criticising the organisers, including Padma Shri Bikram Bahadur Jamatia who has been fighting against the conversion of tribals to Christianity since the late 90s during the peak of insurgency, Pradyot said he would embrace everyone with love and compassion to counter the narrative of hatred being spread by some people.“If someone gets an award from the Centre, it doesn’t necessarily mean the person has to fully surrender himself before the central government. You shouldn’t forget that you were born in this society. Your existence is possible because of this Tiprasa (tribal) community,” Pradyot said.He pointed out that he would counter the narrative of hatred with his two principal weapons — love and compassion. “Those who want to create conflict within the Tiprasa people may continue with their slogan, but in the New Year we shall embrace everyone with love,” he added.“Thansa (unity) will be at the centre of our political agenda, as our people (tribals) have suffered because of divide-and-rule policy for 70 years. If you want to serve your masters you are welcome, we shall go forward with our call,” he said.We also published the following articles recentlyParty worried after Cong leader rallies against tribals delisting bidThe Congress is facing a challenge ahead of the Lok Sabha elections due to a planned mega rally in Ranchi. The rally aims to counter the bid to delist tribals who have converted to Christianity and Islam from their ST status. However, this move could upset the tribal electorate, who follow the Sarna faith. The State Congress should have consulted the JPCCs political affairs committee and the working committee before making such an announcement. The JPCC is concerned that any rash move could backfire and harm their chances in the elections.106335091Rights bodies oppose rally for delisting of converted tribalsCivil rights groups express concern over communal disharmony ahead of a rally demanding the removal of converted tribals from Scheduled Tribes status. The rally, organized by Janjanti Surakha Manch (JSM), an affiliate of RSS-backed Vanvashi Kalyan Kendra, is scheduled a day before Christmas. The opposition BJP supports this cause and plans to use it as a major campaign issue in next year's elections. Jharkhand Janadhikaar Mahasabha (JJM) questions the state government for granting permission to such an event. The rally aims to pit tribals against each other and undermine their independent existence in order to establish a Hindu nation.106243177Pradyot starts scholarship in memory of his fatherTripura royal scion Pradyot Kishore Debbarman launches Maharaja Kirit Bikram Kishore Manikya Scholarship Programme to support poor meritorious civil service aspirants. The scholarship is in memory of his father, the last king of the state regent. Pradyot aims to uplift society by promoting education and providing financial assistance to talented individuals facing financial constraints. He believes that a society cannot develop solely through politics and emphasizes the importance of youth becoming civil servants to contribute to society.106279058",

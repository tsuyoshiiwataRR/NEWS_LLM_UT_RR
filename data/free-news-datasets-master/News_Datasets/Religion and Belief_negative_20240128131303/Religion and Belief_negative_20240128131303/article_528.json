    "text": "Gary Eugene “Hippie” Livermore On Christmas day, Gary Eugene “Hippie” Livermore succumbed to his earthly pain and made a graceful exit from Earth surrounded by the love of family and friends. The firstborn and only son to George and Shirley (Roupp) Livermore was born Dec. 23, 1953. Gary grew up as a quiet country boy with his parents and three sisters in Cogan House. He established a strong work ethic at a very young age that carried with him through his entire life. As a young child, there was never a moment when he wasn’t pushing boundaries in some way; doing burn outs in his Chevelle muscle car in front of the church, taking a ride down the asphalt on his motorcycle, bringing home a wild squirrel, Buddy, to nurture back to health, out hunting small game and shooting himself in the foot, or sneaking over the mountain to see his girlfriend. Gary continued with his strong work ethic by helping on the family farm raising cattle and chickens, planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables from the family’s huge garden. During the summer, you could find Gary on a tractor cutting hay and planting corn. The farm life was never done. Gary had a love for tractors starting at an early age with a peddle tractor. His interest in antique tractors, Oliver crawlers and cars was enhanced with his friendship with Randy Brooks. They often ventured to many car and tractor shows together. Even though he was busy on the farm, Gary earned a high school diploma from Liberty High School in 1972. He went on to attend Williamsport Area Community College for tile setting. Five years later, Gary married the girl that he snuck out to see, Deb (Fischer) Moon. They married on July 2, 1977. A few years later, they welcomed their first child, Joseph. The family soon grew to a family of four with the birth of a daughter, Elizabeth. Although divorced, Deb & Gary remained friends for life. Never one to be a bachelor long, Gary met Faith (Seaman) and was married Oct. 18, 1990. He remained a devoted husband until her death in Nov. of this year. Gary’s work history mostly involved logging and trucking. He and cousin Lonnie set trailers in Wilkes-Barre for HUD during the 1972 flood for families to stay in. He soon went to work for Horner & Caprio Lumber Company skidding logs and trucking. Then the opportunity came to purchase his own trucking company. He bought a White log truck. He hauled logs for Dave Paulhamus and Hartranft with his best friend Chuck Smith, he also hauled for Abner Baylor, Pine Creek, and Jim Horner for many years. He then went to work for Huffsmith Precision hauling logs for them. The most rewarding job was when he went to work with Brooks Lumber Company. He worked there until he retired, he drove a Mack and later the Western Star with “Hippie” written on the door. Although retired he couldn’t sit still and enjoy it, he went to work for Cogan House Township soon after. You could find him snow plowing early in the morning in the winter, doing maintenance on the vehicles in the shop or holding a road sign directing traffic. With his gifted hands, patience, and the love of machinery, Gary continued to fix tractors, cars, vacuums, clocks, lawnmowers just to name a few. The family farm was the scrap pile of Cogan House. He kept everything, often saying: “Don’t throw that away we may need it someday.” There was a good chance that if you were looking for something, Gary probably had it. Gary was a member of Arnot Sportsman Club and the Loyalsock Antique Tractor Assocation. He was a founding member, along with his father, of Birch Run Hunting Club. Gary was a mentor to the upcoming generations of hunters. He taught them how to shoot and skin deer. He enjoyed watching the youth fall in love with the sport of hunting. Gary enjoyed hunting deer in a good snowstorm. After many hours of tracking and a few shots later, Gary was able to harvest a nice 11 point buck on the mountain and he was proud of that moment and that buck. There was always a lot of storytelling, joke telling, and drinking around the table at the cabin. Every morning, breakfast included buckwheat pancakes, potatoes and bacon! Gary was a master at making the best buckwheat pancakes ever! Two days prior to his death, a huge gathering was held to honor his 70th birthday at Trout Run Hotel. The love and support for Gary was overwhelming. That day will be forever remembered by Gary and his family. Gary is survived by his son, Joesph (Valerie) Livermore of Cogan House and daughter, Elizabeth (Derek) Youmans of Liberty; stepchildren, Joe Genetti and Christopher Spencer (Jennifer) of Connecticut; siblings, Teresa (Wilbur) Martz of Cogan House and LeAnn (Scott) Mathias of Muncy; grandchildren, Baily Houseknecht of Mansfield, Levi Houseknecht, Ryder Phillips and Zachary Youmans of Liberty; step-grandchildren Adam (Destiny) Lovett of Ohio, Tiffany (Kaitlynn) Lovett of Cogan House and Dylan Lovett of Morris; step-great-grandchildren, Eli English, Taylor Lovett and Cooper Lovett of Ohio and Drew Lovett of Cogan House; a niece, Tiffany (Dan) and nephews, Joshua (Shanna) and Casey (Sarah) and several cousins. He would have welcomed another great-granddaughter in March. Gary was preceded in death by his parents, George and Shirley Livermore, wife Faith Livermore and sister Sharon Livermore. Gary lived with pancreatic cancer for the last year and a half of his life. While battling the disease his family and friends made every moment count. They got him to Bowling Green Ohio for the National Tractor Pull Championship in 2022, Gary’s close friend Luke Short put him in the seat of his pulling tractor, Ole Yeller, to pull in local events. But the pride of the past few years was the rebuilding of his family’s 4 generation tractor, a 1943 Allis Chalmers, by family and friends. He lived every day with positivity and determination not to let the cancer keep him from doing the things he loved. His palliative care doctor said, “you have been in the ring with Muhammad Ali and had put up one heck of a fight.” A graveside service will be held on Jan. 6, 2024, 1 p.m. at the Cogan House Cemetery on Lepley Road, Trout Run, Pa. Contribution can be made to Loyalsock Antique Tractor Pull Associations in honor of Gary. You can mail contributions to LVAMA P. O Box 174 Williamsport, PA 17703. Final arrangements were entrusted to the Wayne P. Urbine Funeral Home, Inc.(d/b/a Cremation Society of North Central PA) 408 S. Main St., Jersey Shore, PA. www.cremationsocietyncpa.com. “Our Family…Serving your Family”",

    "text": "Dr Akmal\nSHAH ALAM – Umno Youth chief Dr Muhamad Akmal Saleh criticised the proposal by DAP Perak Chairman Datuk Ngeh Koo Ham for the government to appoint non-Muslim experts to assist the Assessing Competencies of State Legislative Assemblies in Enacting Islamic Laws Special Committee.\nDescribing Beruas MP’s suggestion as inappropriate, Akmal said that Ngeh’s action demonstrates a lack of understanding regarding the sensitivity of Muslims in the country.\n“Sharia law applies only to Muslims; hence, there is no need for nor any requirement for such a suggestion from Ngeh Koo Ham.\n“Leaders like this become a thorn in the flesh for the unity government,” he said in a Facebook post yesterday.\nFollowing this, Akmal urged DAP leaders to safeguard sensitivities for the sake of unity within the unity government.\n“Anthony Loke (DAP Secretary-General) can choose whether to protect such leaders or preserve intra-party relationships within the unity government.\n“If they choose to protect leaders like this, then we can forget about the unity in the unity government. Enough is enough!” he said.\nEarlier, Ngeh said that the step was to consider the views of non-Muslims before any changes to the law were made.\nHe also reminded that the Constitution was formed considering the interests of all groups; thus, any changes affecting races and religions should be comprehensively discussed to avoid conflicts.\nThe Special Committee on Assessing the Competencies of State Legislative Assemblies in Enacting Islamic Laws was responsible for examining issues involving federal and state jurisdiction, particularly regarding the competency of State Legislative Assemblies in enacting Islamic laws and the jurisdiction of courts, as stipulated in the Constitution.",

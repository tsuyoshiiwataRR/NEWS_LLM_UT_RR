    "text": "Malappuram: The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) on Friday accused the BJP of using the inauguration of Ram Temple at Ayodhya for its political gains. IUML said that they are approaching the Ram Temple issue with utmost sensitivity. In a press meet held at Panakkad in Malappuram on Friday, IUML leader PK Kunhalikutty said that Congress can take independent decision on whether to attend the event or not. “All political parties should see BJP’s agenda on the issue. Parties with secular views should take an independent stand,” Kunhalikutty said. “IUML has utmost respect for the religious freedom of Hindus. We have expressed our opinion after the Ayodhya verdict. However, the question is not about starting worship. Our stand is against BJP using it as a political event for the next general election,” Kunhalikutty said. He said that the issue was sensitive and IUML has approached it with utmost sensitivity. IUML chief Sayed Sadik Ali Shihab Thangal said that the party is with believers on the issue. “Places of worship are part of beliefs. We are with believers on this. The issue is BJP is trying to turn Ram Temple as an agenda for the next election. We cannot accept that,” Thangal said. In a facebook post, IUML said that the focus of political discussions in a democracy should be poverty, unemployment etc. The IUML advisory committee expressed hope that the people would oppose the attempts of BJP to subvert real political issues in the name of Ram Temple. A day after some Congress leaders voiced opinion against the participation of its leaders in the event, the All India Congress Committee is learnt to have asked its partymen to abstain from making open statements on the issue. AICC is yet to announce a decision on whether senior leaders like Sonia Gandhi would attend the inauguration. The Ram Temple inauguration is scheduled to be held on January 22 at Ayodhya.

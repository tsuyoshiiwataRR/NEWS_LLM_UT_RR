    "text": "Fredora Janiece Byrd\nNACOGDOCHES — Fredora “Jan” Janiece (Crisp) Byrd, age 82, of Nacogdoches, Texas passed away on Tuesday, December 26, 2023.\n“No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. That is why his faith was ‘counted to him as righteousness.’” Romans 4:20-22 (Jan’s “life” verse)\nOn December 26, 2023, at the age of 82, Fredora Janiece “Jan” Crisp Byrd, a woman of great, enduring faith, passed from this life and entered her eternal Heavenly home. Jan was born on November 10, 1941 in Nacogdoches, Texas to Fred and Ruth Crisp. She was raised in Nacogdoches where she attended and excelled in public school, graduating from Nacogdoches High School in 1960 and then on to Stephen F. Austin State University, graduating with a BA in 1963 and a M.Ed in 1976. In 1961, Jan married her high school sweetheart James Byrd.\nAfter SFA, she and James began teaching careers with moves to Banquete, Bay City and Tyler. While in Tyler, she and James opened East Texas Driving School where she “bravely” taught Defensive and Driver Education. After 26 years of teaching home economics and special education in public school, Jan retired in 2003, and she and James returned to Nacogdoches.\nJan would tell you today that the best thing she ever did with her life happened in 1953 at 12 years old when she accepted Jesus Christ as her Savior. She was saved as a result of the witness of the Ellis Martin family when they began taking her to church with their daughter Carolyn. She made a profession of faith in her home through a visit from Fredonia Hill Baptist Church pastor Martin Wedge. That began a lifetime of faithful worship attendance, Bible study, prayer and ministry.\nJan’s life centered around her faith, her family, her friends, and the many students she taught and influenced throughout her teaching career. Two of her greatest joys in life were her children, Jim and Cristie, whom she loved and nurtured and enjoyed becoming “friends” with as well as being their mother. Jan’s life became even more delightful and exciting with the addition of her grandson Luke in 2005. She loved to share with everyone she came in contact with her multitude of pictures (as she was an avid picture taker) of her adorable and much loved Luke. Jan also took great care to cultivate lasting relationships with her brothers, sisters, extended family, church friends, classmates, neighbors, coworkers, and students. She loved to play games, travel, visit, entertain, go on mission trips and surprisingly, Jan learned and enjoyed snow skiing, motorcycle riding and camping.\nJan was a faithful and active member of several churches throughout her life as she lived in four different towns. She originally joined Fredonia Hill Baptist Church by baptism in 1953 and then rejoined FHBC in 2004 when she and James moved back home to Nacogdoches. Jan loved, supported, and participated in FHBC in every way possible until 2018 when Alzheimer’s disease began to limit her life and church participation. Amazingly, even though this disease took over her life and robbed her of most of her memories, she still knew that Jesus loved her and was with her. She could still sing very quietly every word of “Everyday With Jesus,” a song she learned as a child in church.\nJan’s family wishes to express their appreciation to the staff of The Arbor Assisted Living & Memory Care and to Harbor Hospice, especially nurse Lori, for their devoted and tender care during this last year of Jan’s battle with Alzheimer’s disease.\nJaniece was preceded in death by her parents, Fred & Ruth Crisp, her husband James Byrd, her son Jim Byrd, her father-in-law & mother-in-law Howard and Katie Lou Byrd, and her infant brother Fred Wayne.\nShe is survived by her daughter Cristie Ellison & husband Troy, and grandson Luke; brother Ben Crisp & wife Sherril, sister Linda Quillin & husband Neal, brother Kim Crisp & wife Angie; and a host of nieces, nephews, extended family and friends.\nA visitation will be held at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, December 30, 2023, at Cason Monk-Metcalf Sunset Chapel with funeral services beginning at 2:00 p.m. officiated by Chaplain John Wayland and Neal Quillin. Interment will follow at Sunset Memorial Park.\nServing as pallbearers will be Luke Ellison, Andrew Crisp, John Quillin, Jacob Quillin, Moises Romero, Jack Quillin, Richard Barnhart, and Kyle Drewery.\nIn lieu of flowers, the family suggests that memorial contributions be made to the Nacogdoches High School Fredora Janiece “Jan” (Crisp) Byrd Scholarship, P.O. Box 632152, Nacogdoches, Texas 75963.\nArrangements are under the direction of Cason Monk-Metcalf Funeral Directors, Nacogdoches.",

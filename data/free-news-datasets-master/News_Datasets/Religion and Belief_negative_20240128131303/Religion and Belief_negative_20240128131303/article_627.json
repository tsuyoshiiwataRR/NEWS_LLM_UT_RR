    "text": "The Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin condemns the violence against the Armenian community of Jerusalem. The Mother See issued a statement in this regard.\n\"With deep concern, we learned about the ongoing provocative actions around the ‘Cows’ Garden’ estate belonging to the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem.\n\"On December 28, more than three dozen armed persons invaded the territory of the ‘Cows’ Garden,’ carried out violent actions, as a result of which clergymen of the Patriarchate and members of the local Armenian community received various physical injuries.\n\"It is obvious that the provocateurs are once again trying to achieve the appropriation of the ‘Cows’ Garden’ estate through terror, threats and violent actions, violating the procedures defined by the law.\n\"Strictly condemning what happened, we express hope that the Israeli authorities will respond legally to the criminal actions manifested against the Patriarchate and the Armenian community [of Jerusalem], the guilty will be held accountable, and the recurrence of similar incidents will be ruled out,\" the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin noted, in particular, in its statement.",

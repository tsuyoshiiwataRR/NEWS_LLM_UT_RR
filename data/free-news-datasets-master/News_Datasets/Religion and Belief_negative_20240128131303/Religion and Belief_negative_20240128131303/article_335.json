Earlier in November, India-origin Canadian member of Parliament Chandra Arya shared a purported video of Pro Khalistani supporters in Surrey claiming they want to create trouble at the Hindu Lakshmi Narayan Mandir there. He wrote, \"Last week, Khalistan supporters verbally abused a Sikh family outside a Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, BC, according to some reports. Now it appears the same Khalistan group wants to create trouble at the Hindu Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey.\" Underscoring that Hindu temples have remained targets for attacks over the past years, Arya noted by saying, \"Hindu temples have been attacked many times during the last couple of years. Hate crimes are being committed against Hindu-Canadians.\" Moreover, a Hindu temple was vandalised in Canada by extremist elements with Khalistan referendum posters in August this year. In April this year, BAPS Swaminarayan temple was vandalised with anti-India graffiti in Windsor, in Canada's Ontario.

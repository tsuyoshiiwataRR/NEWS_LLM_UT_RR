    "text": "Opinion “It’s always good to have lifeguards nearby, but it’s better to learn how to swim!” ~ Sam Rosenberg. Joe R Biden’s Administration is, even today, still [refusing to sell 27000 US-manufactured M4 rifles](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/u-s-blocks-shipment-of-rifles-to-israel-over-concerns-of-west-bank-settler-violence-9764c87d) to Israel, for emergency defense. There are those within the JRB Administration who express concern that some of these rifles could “end up” in the hands of (Heaven forbid!) Israeli civilians, who might actually keep them in their homes for personal/home defense (a drill many Israelis sincerely wish they had practiced prior to 7 Oct 23). “Armed Jews” still apparently represent a truly frightening thought to leftist politicians, both here and ironically in Israel itself! They worry that these weapons might be used to threaten innocent domestic Palestinians (even though no such assaults have occurred). And yet, JRB [nonchalantly abandoned many times that ](https://www.ammoland.com/2022/11/full-list-of-american-weapons-left-afghanistan/)number of American military-grade M4s in Afghanistan during his panicked, helter-skelter “withdrawal” in the summer of 2021. One can only wonder where all that forsaken American [military equipment ended up.[read Hamas]](https://www.ammoland.com/2023/10/afghanistan-weapons-abandoned-by-biden-administration-appear-in-hamas-terror-attacks/) I think it is safe to say that none of it ended up in the hands of Israelis! The real issue here is that even governments that profess to be “enlightened” still don’t trust the very citizens who put them in power. The concept of “armed citizens” (Jews and everyone else) is always morbidly scary to aspiring autocrats who contemptuously look down upon the rest of us and see nothing more than a motley assortment of fools, bigots, clowns, and buffoons, their words! They don’t even trust members of our own (un)armed services, who have courageously volunteered to defend our nation. Leftist politicians will never respect us as sovereign citizens. We will always scare them. They have regard for none of us despite their less-than-honest rhetoric. This absolute reality was well known to our Founders, which is precisely why we have a Second Amendment as part of our Constitution, and it is, therefore, no mystery why leftists are trying so desperately to get rid of it! “I never feel unsafe, except for when the majority is on my side.” ~ Criss Jami. /John Read Related: [Full List of American War Weapons Lost In Afghanistan ~ VIDEO](https://www.ammoland.com/2022/11/full-list-of-american-weapons-left-afghanistan/#axzz8NIBMgfxV) [Afghanistan Weapons Abandoned By Biden Administration Appear In Hamas Terror Attacks](https://www.ammoland.com/2023/10/afghanistan-weapons-abandoned-by-biden-administration-appear-in-hamas-terror-attacks/) About John Farnam & Defense Training International, Inc As a defensive weapons and tactics instructor, John Farnam will urge you, based on your beliefs, to make up your mind about what you would do when faced with an imminent lethal threat.

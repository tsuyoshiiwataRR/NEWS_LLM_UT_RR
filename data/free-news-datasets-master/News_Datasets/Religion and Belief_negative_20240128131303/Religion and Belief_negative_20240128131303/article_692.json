(Bernama pic) PETALING JAYA: Selangor’s Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah has reminded non-Muslims to respect and refrain from interfering in matters relating to Islamic affairs. Sultan Sharafuddin was responding to a proposal by Beruas MP Ngeh Koo Ham to include non-Muslim constitutional experts in a committee studying the conflicts between shariah laws and the Federal Constitution. ADVERTISEMENT “His Majesty hopes that politicians, especially non-Muslims, refrain from continuously interfering in Islamic matters. “Instead, non-Muslims should emulate Muslims, who do not interfere in the religious affairs of other faiths in Malaysia,” the ruler said in a post on the Selangor Royal Office’s Facebook page today.

Sultan Sharafuddin said he also took note of DAP secretary-general Loke Siew Fook’s statement on the matter. ADVERTISEMENT Earlier today, Loke sought to downplay the controversy stemming from Ngeh’s proposal. He said the party is not trying to interfere in Islamic affairs, and also clarified Ngeh’s comments on the authority behind the setting up of the committee, while saying that any recommendations which involve amendments to the law must be brought to the Cabinet. ADVERTISEMENT He said non-Muslims need not be concerned about the composition of the committee as any legal amendment involving the rights of non-Muslims must be scrutinised and decided by the Cabinet before following the “usual parliamentary process”.

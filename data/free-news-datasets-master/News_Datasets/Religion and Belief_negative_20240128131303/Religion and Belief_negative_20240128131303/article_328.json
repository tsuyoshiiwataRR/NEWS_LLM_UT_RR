    "text": "28 December 2023, 22:11\nKuban Archbishop Viktor Pivovarov accused of repeatedly discrediting Russian Army\nViktor Pivovarov, Archbishop of the Slavyansk-on-Kuban and South Russian Russia’s Orthodox Church, has been accused of repeatedly discrediting the Russian Armed Forces. The reason for the institution of a criminal case became his published article condemning the special military operation (SMO) in Ukraine.\nThe “Caucasian Knot” has reported that the Russia’s Orthodox Church reported that searches were carried out in the St. Intercession-Tikhon Church in Slavyansk-on-Kuban in connection with the repeated discrediting of the Russian Armed Forces by Archbishop Viktor (Pivovarov).\nThe Slavyansk-on-Kuban City Court fined Viktor Pivovarov 40,000 roubles for discrediting the Russian Armed Forces. On March 29, Archbishop Viktor Pivovarov confirmed that during his sermon in the cathedral, he had voiced words that the court considered as discrediting the Russian Army.\n“Now not an administrative, but a criminal case has been instituted against me for a repeated violation,” said Archbishop Viktor (Pivovarov) as quoted by the “Kavkaz.Realii”*.\nThe Russia’s Orthodox Church (known as RosOC) is a religious association of non-canonical Orthodoxy of the Russian tradition in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and other countries, mainly in the territory of the former USSR.\n*Included by the Russian Ministry of Justice (MoJ) into the register of foreign agents.\nThis article was originally published on the Russian page of 24/7 Internet agency ‘Caucasian Knot’ on December 28, 2023 at 03:39 pm MSK.

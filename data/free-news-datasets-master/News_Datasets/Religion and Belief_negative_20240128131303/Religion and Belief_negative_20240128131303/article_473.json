    "text": "Senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has charged president Bola Ahmed Tinubu to take action that would influence the course of history. He said the country sould not be moving from bad to worse leadership despite the nation’s natural resources. In his Christmas message signed and handed over to journalists in Akure, Ondo State, on Friday, the pastor also urged the politicians to honour their words and promises. Giwa said: “We can’t continue to move from bad to worse leadership. Let me appeal to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to execute projects that will influence history. “He should know that whatever you do in life, your reward awaits you in heaven. You came with nothing, and you are going with nothing. “Fulfill all your electioneering promises, and do not fulfill them when millions of souls must have died of hunger. “It doesn’t take you so much time to assess the true value of the nation’s resources and make them accessible to Nigerians. “We thought we had gone over bad governance when tenure of the former president Muhammadu was ending, here comes another one. Please, do not let us feel dejected and disappointed. “Quickly address the issues of Petroleum, security, employment, and infrastructure.”",

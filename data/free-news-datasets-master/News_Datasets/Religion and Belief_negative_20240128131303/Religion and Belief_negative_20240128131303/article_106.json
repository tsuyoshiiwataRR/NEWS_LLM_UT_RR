    "text": "The Biden Administration's continued efforts to target Christians and conservatives have taken priority on his short list of daily to-do's. President Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against the largest Christian university in the United States on Wednesday. Grand Canyon University is facing a second lawsuit by an agency under the Biden Administration within the past few months in what the university says is a coordinated attack by multiple agencies against the institution. The lawsuit accuses the university of engaging in fraudulent advertising practices by marketing itself as a nonprofit institution and misrepresenting the price of its doctoral programs. The FTC claims the school has not adequately disclosed the costs of its \"continuation courses,\" which allegedly add thousands of dollars to the publicly disclosed cost of the degree. \"Grand Canyon deceived students by holding itself out as a nonprofit institution and misrepresenting the costs and number of courses required to earn doctoral degrees,\" Samuel Levine, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, [said](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/12/ftc-sues-grand-canyon-university-deceptive-advertising-illegal-telemarketing) in a press release. \"We will continue aggressively pursuing those who seek to take advantage of students.\" Recommended According to the lawsuit, the Arizona-based university's \"marketing activities have also resulted in millions of abusive telemarketing calls to consumers who have specifically requested that Defendants not solicit them, and to individuals on the National Do Not Call Registry.\" In October, the Department of Education (ED) fined Grand Canyon University more than $37.7 million after an investigation found the school \"consistently misrepresented doctoral program costs.\" The university claims that the legal battle with the Biden Administration results from a deliberate targeting campaign. The school's president, Brian Mueller, told the Washington Examiner earlier this year that the investigation into Grand Canyon U was launched in lousy faith, calling them \"fishing expeditions.\" \"Given the major problems that exist in higher education related to high tuition costs, significant student debt, poor student loan default rates, long completion times, etc., it is baffling that the federal government has chosen to target a Christian university that is addressing those issues in very positive ways,\" the school said. \"No other institution in higher education is facing this level of government scrutiny, which speaks volumes about these agencies' motivations and agenda.\"",

    "text": "As the global community celebrated the birth of Jesus Christ, a tragic incident unfolded in Plateau State. A Christian community became the target of a terrorist attack, resulting in the loss of over 100 innocent lives. The heart-wrenching scenes of crying babies strapped to the backs of their deceased mothers circulated on social media, amplifying the gravity of the situation. While leaders worldwide, including the President of Nigeria, condemned this heinous act, a disconcerting comment from a notable figure in the Nigerian social media sphere exposed a shocking level of insensitivity and hypocrisy. The individual, a former media assistant to a past president of Nigeria, callously suggested that the mass killing in Jos could be excused due to the vastness of the region and the purported lack of adequate policing. This remark did not only lack empathy but also highlighted hypocrisy, given their history of enjoying government-issued security personnel during unofficial outings. The irony is evident when recalling a personal encounter with this ex-government official, who once arrived at a Lagos restaurant in a government-issued SUV accompanied by two uniformed police officers for a non-official trip. It is hypocritical for someone with a history of parading the streets with uniformed police officers to claim that Nigeria’s police force is undermanned to fulfill its constitutional duty of safeguarding citizens. This contradiction raises concerns of hypocrisy or cognitive dissonance. The prevailing practice of government appointees, celebrities, and their families enjoying armed police escorts exacerbates the issue. The recent Christmas day killing is not an isolated incident but a recurring tragedy in Nigeria’s middle belt region. Despite a substantial presence of security forces, terrorists continue to evade security measures, terrorizing innocent citizens. Nigeria currently falls short of the United Nations’ recommended ratio of one police officer for every 450 citizens, with the actual ratio being one officer for every 600 citizens. It is crucial to note that the issue of inadequate policing is not unique to Nigeria. In Canada, for instance, as of 2022, there was one police officer for every 550 citizens, and the country is significantly larger than Nigeria. However, crimes are promptly addressed, and law enforcement agencies intervene without prolonged delays. During the Christmas day attack in Nigeria, terrorists reportedly operated unchallenged for 10 hours before leaving. While there is a clear need to augment the manpower of the Nigerian Police Force, it is equally imperative to ensure that personnel are strategically deployed to areas requiring heightened security. The misuse of police escorts by the political class and their associates must be curbed to redirect resources where genuinely needed. In conclusion, the Christmas day tragedy underscores the urgent need for responsible and strategic policing in Nigeria. It is a call to action for political leaders and their appointees to refrain from abusing the use of security operatives, ensuring that these resources are utilized judiciously for the benefit of all citizens.

    "text": "James Timothy Dalke (April 3, 1947 - December 23, 2023)\nOn Saturday, December 23, 2023 James “Tim” Timothy Dalke peacefully passed away in Woodstock, Virginia at the age of 76. A Celebration of Life service will be held on Saturday, January 20th, 2024 at 2:00pm at St. Paul’s United Church of Christ. The family will receive friends at the church one hour prior to the service. Reverend Anne Findlay-Chamberlain will officiate. Burial will be private in Massanutten Cemetery in Woodstock.\nBorn on April 3, 1947 in Woodstock, Virginia, Tim was the son of the late William Franklin Dalke Jr. and Kathryn Shaffer Dalke who instilled in him a sense of duty, honor, and commitment to his fellow citizens. Tim lived in Woodstock his entire life. His love for Woodstock and the community ran deep.\nIn 1969, Tim served his country in Vietnam as an Infantry Sergeant with the 2nd/17th Calvary, 101st Airborne Division earning him the Bronze Star, the army Commendation Medal for meritorious achievement in ground operations, the Air Medal for meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight, the Vietnam Service Medal and National Defense Medal.\nAs a young man, Tim was a founding member of the musical group “The Shifters” where he played guitar. Tim’s love for music was lifelong, and every Christmas he gathered his children and grandchildren around the family piano to sing Christmas carols together. He graduated from Shippensburg University in 1972 with a degree in Business Administration. Tim went on to work for and eventually take over the family’s theatre business, the Community Theatre in Woodstock, and the Family Drive-In, located in Stephen’s City, Virginia, where generations of families gathered under the Dalke’s Theaters’ marquee.\nTim was a lifelong member of St. Paul’s United Church of Christ. He was raised in the church and eventually became a Trustee from 2014 to 2023. Tim and Cathy served as greeters for the month of December continuing a family tradition established by his father. He served his community as a member of the Woodstock Town Council for 8 years and as Mayor for 9 years. He was Past Secretary/Treasurer of the National Association of Theatre Owners of Virginia, Past President of the Woodstock Chamber of Commerce and served on the Advisory Board of Marathon Bank. He was also a member of the Woodstock Rotary Club, Woodstock American Legion Post #199, VFW Post 2447 of Edinburg and Woodstock Moose Lodge 575.\nTim’s entire life and in large measure, his heart belonged to and was rooted deeply in the town of Woodstock. He loved the town and its people, he loved its sense of quiet community, and he loved the enduring friendships that it gave to him over the course of his lifetime. Tim loved being a part of the Walton and Smoot’s Coffee Club. He was an avid outdoorsman spending as much time hunting and fishing as he could. More than anything, Tim cherished time spent with his family, especially his grandchildren.\nTim is survived by his beloved wife, Catherine Fadely Dalke of 51 years; three children, Leah Dalke Timmerman (Price) of Richmond, Virginia, Amy Dalke Palatnick (Brian) of St. Louis, Missouri, and Eric Timothy Dalke (Jen) of Woodstock; three brothers, William Dalke III (Sylvia) of Woodstock, Jeffrey Dalke (Anne) of Edinburg and Peter Dalke (Kathleen) of Mosier, Oregon; and seven grandchildren, Tatum and Quin Timmerman, Sophie and Henry Palatnick, and William, Caroline, and Catherine Dalke.\nIn lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to St. Paul’s UCC Miller Hoffman Dalke Scholarship Fund, 235 S. Main Street, Woodstock, VA 22664.\nOnline condolences may be left at\nwww.valleyfs.com\nArrangements by Heishman Funeral Home Inc., Woodstock, VA.",

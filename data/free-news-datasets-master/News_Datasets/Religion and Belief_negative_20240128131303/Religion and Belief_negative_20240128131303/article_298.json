    "text": "Mangaluru: Leaders of various political parties and organisations have expressed ire over RSS leader Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat’s statement on Muslim women and are gearing up to hold protests seeking his arrest.The Joint Forum of Secular Parties in Dakshina Kannada, headed by former minister B Ramanath Rai of the Congress and DYFI state president Muneer Katipalla, said on Thursday, that the police should arrest Bhat immediately in connection with the case registered against him at the Srirangapatna town police station in Mandya district. “Bhat has not only spoken ill about Muslim women, but also dishonoured womanhood. There is a conspiracy to sow the seeds of communal hatred behind Bhat’s statements. Bhat, who is upset over a Congress government in Karnataka, has been making provocative statements for political reasons,” said forum president Ramanath Rai.Forum secretary Muneer Katipalla said that Bhat has been making provocative statements to divide the society for the past 35 years. “It is shameful that Bhat, a medical practitioner and a senior citizen, has made obscene remarks. Bhat is under the impression that Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts will see repercussions if he is arrested. However, the fact is that people in the coastal region cutting across all castes, religions and politics have expressed their objections to his remarks against Muslim women. The government should argue strongly against Bhat’s appeal in the high court and ensure his early arrest,” Muneer said.CPM leader K Yadava Shetty, CPI leader B Shekhara, DSS state convener M Devadas, social activist MG Hegde, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha member Adithya Kallaje, AITUC member Karunakara Maripalla, District Congress Committee Minority Cell president Shahul Hameed and advocate Dinesh Hegde Ulepady were present. DYFI Ullal taluk unit stated in a release that the members will hold a protest demanding the arrest of Bhat at Masthikatte in Ullal at 5pm on December 29.WIM to fight legally Women India Movement (WIM) state president Fathima Naseema said that the organisation will take the constitutional route to fight against RSS leader Bhat.She told reporters at the Pathrika Bhavan, here, on Thursday that the Congress government has been exhibiting its inability in handling the case against Bhat. “By not acting against Bhat, the government is also indirectly showing disregard to the women. The police have refused permission for WIM to hold a protest against Bhat and also served notices to women. The government should ensure the arrest of Bhat immediately, if it has faith in democracy and Constitution,” she added.",

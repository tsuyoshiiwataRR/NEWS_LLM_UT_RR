    "text": "Spain is aggressively enforcing a new law that prohibits large groups from praying the rosary in public and now officials are targeting pro-life people praying at abortion centers.\nIn late November, the government had ordered a stop to the praying of the rosary. Since then, in response to the Socialist Party’s threat to declare public prayer in the autonomous region of Madrid illegal, Catholics and others have been publicly praying at locations across the nation.\nThe public Rosary has been taking place in protest to the recently formed Socialist government, which negotiated with separatist, anti-Catholic, small political groups in the Spanish parliament to form a majority. Socialist leader Pedro Sánchez obtained the support of the small regional parties in parliament by agreeing to an amnesty for violent separatist criminals jailed for past acts of terrorism.\nSince then, police have stepped up enforcement of the prohibitions on prayer, including now at abortion centers.\nAs the Catholic News Agency reports :\nThe Government Delegation (public administration) in Madrid mobilized approximately 20 riot police officers to prevent about 10 young people from praying the rosary in front of the Dator abortion clinic.\nOn Dec. 28, the feast of the Holy Innocents, the officers also arrested Dr. Jesús Poveda, who was staging a one-man sit-in at the doors of the Dator clinic.The doctor has spent close to 40 years helping mothers at risk of abortion.\nClick here to sign up for pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\nPoveda was thus faithful to what already constitutes a tradition of the pro-life movement in Spain by carrying out an act of passive resistance on only one day of the year, the feast of the Holy Innocents, while dedicating the remaining 364 to saving babies.\nPoveda went to the doors of the abortion center and sat down on the ground in protest near the clinic doors. Shortly after, a group of young people from the Praying Is Not a Crime movement arrived at the scene with the intention of meditating on the luminous mysteries of the rosary.\nSeveral police officers automatically made them move a hundred meters (about 330 feet) away from the place, where on their knees and displaying a large wooden cross and an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, they began to pray the rosary.\nAt about 9:30 in the morning, the officers told Poveda to leave the place near the doors of the abortion clinic, which he refused to do, offering passive resistance. The police then transferred him to a patrol car in which he was taken to the police station.\nAccording to the report, police removed the pro-life advocates in part because a pro-abortion event was scheduled later in the day.",

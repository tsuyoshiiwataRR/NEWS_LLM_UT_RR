    "text": "Islamabad: As the Israel-Hamas war enters Day 84, Pakistan has announced a ban on all celebrations for the new year. Pakistani caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar announced a ban on all types of celebrations for the new year, including NYE celebrations, to express solidarity with Palestine. PM Kakar urged the Pakistani people to refrain from celebrating the coming year and to show \\\"sobriety and humility\\\" for the New Year. \\\"Keeping in mind the seriously concerning situation in Palestine and to show solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters, there will be a strict ban by the government on holding any kind of event for New Year,\\\" stated the Pakistani PM. Since the start of the war on October 7, 2023, over 21,000 Palestinians have been killed across Gaza and West Bank at the hands of Israeli attacks. In this massive death toll, a majority of the deaths have been attributed to women and children. \\\"The whole Pakistani nation and the Muslim world are in a sheer state of anguish over the massacre of innocent children and genocide of unarmed Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank,\\\" Kakar added further. In Pakistan, the New Year celebrations are not big or grandeur in any way as various Islamic groups tend to try and stop all forms of festivities, sometimes forcefully. However, this year, the government has announced the ban. While addressing the nation, the Pakistani PM added that two aid packages have been dispatched to Palestine and a third one is on the way. Kakar added that Islamabad is also in talks with Jordan and Egypt to provide timely aid to Gaza and evacuate the injured. Fireworks Banned At UAE’s SharjahSharjah, the third largest emirate in the United Arab Emirates also announced a ban on fireworks for New Year's Eve celebrations. Taking to Facebook, Sharjah Police announced the ban on fireworks to express solidarity with their “Gazan brothers and sisters”. Anyone violating the ban would be charged with a fine.",

    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 29 (Bernama) -- The proposal by Beruas Member of Parliament Datuk Ngeh Koo Hamfor the government to appoint non-Muslim legal experts into the special committee to study issues related to the competencies of state legislative assembly in enacting Islamic laws was unfounded.\nMinister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Religious Affairs) Datuk Dr Mohd Na'im Mokhtar said the Prime Minister’s Department (Religious Affairs) would always refer matters related to Islamic affairs to the Malaysian National Council for Islamic Religious Affairs (MKI) chaired by the Sultan of Selangor Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah, and also to the state Islamic authorities.\n“Therefore, all parties are urged not to make any statements that could cause public concern. All parties must have full confidence and give space to the special committee to carry out its role professionally and effectively,” he said in a statement today.\nHe said the findings of the study, as well as views, and suggestions proposed by the special committee, will be presented to MKI and the Conference of Rulers.\nThe special committee, which convened its first meeting on Dec 5, was chaired by former Chief Justice Tun Zaki Tun Azmi.\nMohd Na'im said that all appointed members of the special committee have expertise in the Federal Constitution, and civil and Syariah laws, qualifying them to conduct studies, provide opinions, and make recommendations.\n“This is to ensure that the best and harmonious solutions can be made to resolve all issues arising in this matter to elevate and empower Syariah laws and judiciary system in the country,” he added.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 IFLIX channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial",

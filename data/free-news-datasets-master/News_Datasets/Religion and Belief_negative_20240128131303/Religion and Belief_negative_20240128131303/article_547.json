The leaders alleged that 'the martyrs’ soil got defiled by the visit of Pandian to the place who is promoting beef consumption on Odisha Chief Minister’s directions'.\nScores of men and women from Sri Bairagi Sishu Mandir took out a rally and reached the Saheed Padia and sprinkled cow dung and turmeric water on the entire area.\nAlso Read:\nVHP demands investigation as row erupts over Kamiya Jani\n“The way VK Pandian took Kamiya Jani, who consumes and promotes beef, into Puri Srimandir and offered Maha Prasad is not acceptable. It is an attempt to defame Hindu culture. Mahila Morcha and others sprinkled the entire area here with cow dung to purify it. We urge everybody to come forward to save Jagannath culture,” said Bhadrak BJP Mahila Morcha leader, Kalpana Jena.\nResponding to the allegations made by the BJP, BJD leader Harekrushna Padhy said, “This shows the Opposition has become intolerant and is frustrated. The stadium where the meeting was held has been named after martyrs. Those who sprinkled cow dung water need to purify themselves first. The Opposition has nothing to do other than coming up with frivolous allegations and opposing the government.”\nAlso Read:\nIndira Gandhi could not enter Puri Srimandir, but Kamiya Jani could!

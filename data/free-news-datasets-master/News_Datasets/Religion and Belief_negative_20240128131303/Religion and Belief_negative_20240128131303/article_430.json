    "text": "Status: 29.12.2023, 07:21 a.m.\nCommentsPrint Share\nA surveillance camera hangs on a façade. © Marijan Murat/dpa\nHostilities against Jews continue to be part of everyday life in Baden-Württemberg. And it turns out that the decreasing violence is on the rise again after a brief decline. Not all deeds go to German accounts.\nStuttgart - There is agitation and insults, Israeli flags are burned and walls are smeared with slogans. And that almost every day somewhere in Baden-Württemberg. In the first nine months of this year alone, 184 anti-Semitic crimes were registered, which is slightly more than in the first three quarters of the previous year (175). And the number is likely to rise significantly, because the protests following the massacre by the Islamist Hamas in Israel on October 7 are not yet included in the statistics. There is an increase in anti-Semitic crimes in Baden-Württemberg, the Ministry of the Interior said on request.\nA brief look back shows this: In mid-November, the Bundesliga football club VfB Stuttgart banned two spectators from the stadium for racist and anti-Semitic insults. A few days earlier, anti-Semitic paint smears were discovered at the Württembergische Landesbühne in Esslingen and on steps leading to the castle there, unknown persons also smeared the back of Rastatt Castle with slogans in red spray paint, and house walls in Ludwigsburg were also sprayed. In the three weeks after the Hamas attack alone, around 30 crimes related to Israeli flags were registered, according to the State Office of Criminal Investigation.\n\"The Jews' sense of security has been permanently shaken,\" said Baden-Württemberg Interior Minister Thomas Strobl (CDU) against the background of the war against Hamas and the demonstrations against Israel. \"It is intolerable that Jewish people are now hesitant again or do not dare to identify themselves as Jews on our streets.\" Physical assaults and direct confrontations are the absolute exception in the southwest. \"But any destruction and damage to Israeli flags is also unacceptable. Because this also shows the evil grimace of anti-Semitism,\" said Strobl.\nAccording to Baden-Württemberg's anti-Semitism commissioner Michael Blume, Hamas is also using the latest ways to exert influence: \"Hamas has managed to use digital terror propaganda against Israelis to bring even more anti-Semites to the point of committing crimes,\" the doctor of religion and political science told the German Press Agency.\nAccording to Blume, the number of anti-Semitic crimes in Baden-Württemberg has increased by 206 percent in the past ten years. \"However, the longer-term development of anti-Semitic crimes is a cause for concern both in the state and nationwide,\" Blume warns in his report to the state parliament, which has already been presented. \"Anti-Semitism is an experience that many Jews regularly encounter in their everyday lives from the middle of society.\"\nWhile the number of anti-Semitic crimes in Baden-Württemberg was 2017 cases in 99, it increased to 136 a year later and finally to 182 in 2019 and 228 cases in 2020. Two years ago, it suddenly increased to 337, and a year later, after a significant decline, the number of crimes reached 245. And the police do not always see a political motive, it is not always clear what is behind it.\nThe catalogue of anti-Semitic offences includes incitement to hatred as well as insults or the so-called use of signs of unconstitutional organisations, usually the wearing of a swastika. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the focus in the past year was on the damage or removal of flags of the State of Israel, which were hoisted at town halls, for example, as a sign of solidarity. Damage to property in the form of paint smears, some of which incited hatred, also belonged to this area. \"Physical assaults and direct confrontations remain rare,\" the Interior Ministry said.\nAccording to these data, the majority of anti-Semitic crimes are still motivated by right-wing extremism, with a clear upward trend. Of the 184 violent crimes in the first nine months of this year, 135 are attributed to this so-called phenomenon area, compared to 109 cases in the first three quarters of the previous year.\nMy news Lake in Baden-Württemberg is the largest in the country – it is often overlookedread\nThe oldest butcher's shop in Germany comes from Baden-Württemberg read\nThese outlet centers in Baden-Wurttemberg areRead more\nMother to blame for the death of child (2) from Bingen?

Anti-Semitism has increased on both the left and the right, but it is also imported. \"Many people have come to our country from regions where Israel is considered an enemy and where there is a perception that Jews must be fought,\" Münch said. This anti-Semitism, imported from abroad, must be named and action must be taken against it. Dpa",

    "text": "The Democratic Teachers' Front (DTF) has strongly urged the withdrawal of mandatory registration and attendance for a certificate-cum-refresher course on Srimad Bhagavad Gita at Delhi University's Ramanujan College.\nThe Left-leaning organisation accused Ramanujan principal SP Agarwal of abusing authority, coercing teaching and non-teaching staff to attend the course beyond official hours, and termed it an \"autocratic trait.\"\n\"Ramanujan principal SP Agarwal has abused the powers vested in him to dictate to all teachers and non-teaching staff to compulsorily register for and attend a refresher/certificate course on Srimad Bhagavad Gita,\" the DTF said in a statement.\n\"Illegally coercing teachers and non-teaching staff to remain engaged till 6.30 pm beyond official duties and the added burden of conducting the ongoing semester examinations of students is unacceptable,\" it added.\nThe refresher course, offered by the Teaching Learning Centre until January 9, is conducted both online and offline from 4:30 pm to 6:30 pm.\nIn an email to the teaching staff, the college principal said that the course is being offered in line with the Indian Knowledge System Centre proposed to be set up at the college.\nIt further said that the college will hold such programmes not only for Bhagavad Gita but also for vedas, which are part of the Indian Knowledge System.\nA Ramanujan official on condition of anonymity said that the administration will not take any coercive action against teachers who don't attend the course. \"The mandatory attendance is kept to ensure that teachers and other staff participate in the course.\"\nAccording to the email, all newly recruited teaching staff in the last one-year have to compulsorily register and attend the programme in offline mode along with non-teaching staff. Other senior teaching staff are given a choice to attend the course in offline or online mode.\nThe DTF contends that such courses contradict the centre's goal of promoting independent, critical, and creative thinking, fostering the propagation of \"sectarian beliefs.\"\n(With inputs from PTI)",

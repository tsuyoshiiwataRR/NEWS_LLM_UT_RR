    "text": "Catholic leaders demanded government action after Christian villages in the central Nigerian state of Plateau suffered a series of attacks over Christmas weekend that left nearly 200 dead.\n“This indeed has been a gory Christmas for us,” Plateau’s governor Caleb Mutfwang said in a Tuesday statement that noted the attacks were “well-coordinated” and used “heavy weapons”.\nBishop Matthew Kukah of Sokoto in northern Nigeria called on President Bola Tinubu to take immediate action to protect the Nigerian people, telling him he had “no excuses before God or the people of Nigeria” and that “neither God nor history will forgive you if you fail”.\nThe bishop’s address emphasised how “Nigerians have almost lost hope”\nthat “a government can really and truly care for them” and that “our politicians will put our interests first and find a way to deal with the cancer of corruption”.\nAccording to accounts by several local sources and human rights activists, 198 Christians were killed in a series of terror attacks in 26 Christian communities in Plateau. The attacks began the night of 23 December and continued into Christmas Day.\nMaria Lozano, a representative for Aid to the Church in Need, told CNA that the Christmas attacks made the weekend “one of the most violent [times] in the area’s history”. She said she believes that the Fulani tribe is responsible for the attacks.\nThis was the latest instance of terrorists targeting Nigerian Christians on significant feast days, following\nthe 2022 Pentecost massacre that killed 50 people.\nLozano said the attacks were the result of a combination of problems including ethnic and religious strife\nbetween the Christian farmers and nomadic Fulani herdsmen.\nShe pointed out that the timing of the attacks\nhad “religious undertones”.\nLozano also said that a “lack of response from the government” over the years\nhas worsened the situation in the region and that tangible government support has been largely absent after the Christmas massacre. This has forced churches to take on the “primary responsibility of providing assistance,” she said.\nPresident Bola Tinubu ordered an “immediate mobilisation of relief sources” and directed the country’s security agencies to “scour every part of the zone” and “apprehend the culprits responsible for these atrocities”.\nMutfwang called on the security agencies to identify those who have been “the sponsors of these attacks” so that the government can act to “unravel all those responsible”.\n“Until we cut off the supply in terms of sponsorship, we may never be able to see the end of this,” he said.",

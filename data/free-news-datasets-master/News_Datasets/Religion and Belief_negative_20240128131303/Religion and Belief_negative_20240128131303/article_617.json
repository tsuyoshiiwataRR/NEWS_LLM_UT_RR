    "text": "From misinformation around the [ Ram Temple](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/ram-mandir-inauguration-invitations-opposition-political-leaders-ayodhya) in Ayodhya to fake posts attributed to Delhi Chief Minister [Arvind Kejriwal ](https://www.thequint.com/photos/delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-inaugurates-auditorium-with-state-of-the-art-facilities-at-br-ambedkar-school-of-special-excellence)and Rajya Sabha MP [Kapil Sibal](https://www.thequint.com/news/law/why-there-should-be-no-contempt-case-against-kapil-sibal), here are the top five pieces of misinformation that went viral this week. 1. No, This Image Does Not Show Muslim Sculptor Making Idols for Ayodhya Ram Temple An image of a man wearing a skull cap and touching the idol of [Lord Ram](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/video-from-nagpur-shared-as-ayodhya-ram-temple-fact-check) is being shared to claim that it shows a person from the Muslim community creating the sculptures for Ram Temple in [Uttar Pradesh](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/up-woman-accidentally-shot-police-aligarh-police-station-cctv)'s [Ayodhya](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/amazing-unforgettable-pm-modi-on-ayodhya-record-of-lit-diyas-diwali-2023). However, we found out that the image dates back to 2019 and shows a man named Saddam Hussein cleaning idols kept at the Ram Mandir in Rajajinagar, Bengaluru, ahead of the Ramanavami festival. Reports noted that three people are involved in making Lord Ram's sculptures. Their names are Ganesh Bhatt, Arun Yogiraj, and Satya Narayan Pandey.

Did RBI Withdraw the Old Rs 100 Banknotes? No, Viral Claim is False! A social media post claimed that the Reserve Bank of India ( [RBI](https://www.thequint.com/opinion/replacement-not-demonetisation-rbis-note-withdrawal-doesnt-disrupt-economy)) had recently announced the old series of Rs 100 banknote as invalid. The post also noted that RBI has given a deadline to exchange these old banknotes by 31 March 2024. However, this claim is false. RBI has not released any such guidelines about withdrawing the old Rs 100 banknotes. The Quint spoke to Yogesh Dayal, the spokesperson for RBI, who also dismissed the viral claims.

Fake Post of Kapil Sibal 'Ending His Life' if Ram Temple Gets Built Goes Viral A screenshot of a post on X (formerly Twitter) allegedly posted by [Rajya Sabha ](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/criminal-law-reform-bills-act-presidents-assent-lok-sabha-rajya-sabha)Member of Parliament and senior advocate Kapil Sibal is being shared on social media. The post claimed that in 2020, [Sibal](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/no-hope-left-in-supreme-court-kapil-sibal-slams-recent-judgements) shared a message about 'ending his life' before the completion of the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. We found out that this is a doctored post. Sibal did not share such a post in 2020, and he also dismissed this allegation on his official X account recently. You can read our fact-check [here](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/fake-tweet-kapil-sibal-suicide-ram-mandir-temple-fact-check#read-more). 4. Alarmist Post on Severity of COVID-19 XBB Subvariant Resurfaces Amid JN.1 Cases Amid the World Health Organization's ( [WHO](https://www.thequint.com/fit/need-to-cut-back-global-salt-intake-levels-who-warns)) declaration of the new COVID-19 subvariant, JN.1, as a 'variant of interest', social media users posted about the symptoms of the XBB subvariant of COVID-19. These posts stated that individuals may not show symptoms such as cough and fever. However, people could show symptoms such as aches, loss of appetite etc. The posts also noted that the variant is \"five times more toxic\" than the Delta variant of coronavirus. The post not only contains highly alarming statements but also presents inaccurate information about the XBB subvariant of COVID-19, despite the fact that the newly discovered variant is actually the JN.1 variant. You can read our fact-check [here](https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/warnings-about-xbb-omicron-subvariant-severity-resurfaces-amid-jn1-covid-19-infections-fact-check#read-more). 5. BJP Leaders Share Fake Screenshot To Take a Dig at Kejriwal Skipping ED Summons A screenshot of a X (formerly Twitter) post, purportedly shared by Delhi Chief Minister [ Arvind Kejriwal](https://www.thequint.com/photos/delhi-cm-kejriwal-and-lg-saxena-launch-500-electric-buses-bringng-total-to-1300) in 2012, is going viral on social media. The post read, \"As a patriot Indian, my head hangs in shame when our corrupt leaders do not appear before ED and CBI even after multiple summons by the investigating agencies, when they should have resigned from their posts immediately as soon as the allegations were made.\" However, this is a fabricated screenshot. We did not find any post of this nature on Kejriwal's account. Additionally, we noticed discrepancies in formatting on X.

    "text": "A CNN contributor who claims to be a Catholic priest made the dual false claims on the air that Jesus was a “Palestinian” and that he was “homeless.”\nFather Edward Beck appeared on CNN early on Christmas morning and made the effort to link the birth of Christ to the current confrontation going on in Gaza between the nation of Israel and the terrorists of Hamas. But instead of being praised for an uplifting message, the commentator faced an intense backlash for being so embarrassingly wrong about the birth and lineage of Jesus Christ.\nDuring the segment, Beck was asked about the “pain and suffering” taking place all over the world this year and was asked to speak to those feeling “hopeless” in these tumultuous times, the New York Post reported. He replied by speaking of the birth of Christ.\nI think the message of Christmas is that God enters into it with us and we’re not alone in it,” Beck said.\n“What I’m so struck by is that the story of Christmas is about a Palestinian Jew — how often do you find those words put together? A Palestinian Jew born into a time when his country was occupied, right?” Beck absurdly claimed.\n“They can’t find a place for her to even give birth, his mother. They’re homeless. They eventually have to flee as refugees into Egypt, no less. I mean, you can’t make up the parallels to our current world situation right now,” he rambled on",

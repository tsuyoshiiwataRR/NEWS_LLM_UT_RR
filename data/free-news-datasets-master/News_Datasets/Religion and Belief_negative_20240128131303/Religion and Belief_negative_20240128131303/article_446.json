    "text": "AUGUSTA – Rita J. Eccles, 79, passed away unexpectedly on Dec. 23, 2023, at the Alfond Center for Health, surrounded by her loving family. Born on Dec. 9, 1944, in Lewiston, Rita was the cherished daughter of the late Alfred and Jeanette (Mailhot) LeBlanc. She graduated from Lewiston High School and furthered her education at Mr. Bernard’s School of Hair Fashion, Inc.\nRita’s exceptional talent in cosmetology was evident as she not only graduated with distinction but also competed and triumphed in numerous hair styling competitions across the country. Her crowning achievement was national recognition in New York, USA, for her outstanding contributions to the world of hair styling.\nIn 1965, Rita married her high school sweetheart, Ronald Eccles, and the couple established their home in Wells before eventually settling in Augusta, where they raised their two children, Jane and John. Throughout her lifetime, Rita continued her passion for cosmetology, opening Rita’s Curl Inn at multiple nursing homes in Augusta, where she extended her warmth and expertise to the elderly.\nDespite facing adversity, Rita successfully completed cancer treatment and was in remission, a testament to her strength and resilience.\nRita’s legacy is one of love, compassion, generosity and above all her joy in making people happy. She devoted herself to helping others and making them feel special, showcasing her talents not only as a cosmetologist but also as a skilled cook and homemaker. Her family, especially her grandchildren, held a special place in her heart, and she took great joy in attending their sports and special events. Rita, also enjoyed seeing her children and grandchildren playing in the water, swimming, and boating at their family camp. Rita found solace in the simple pleasures of life, such as ocean visits, apple picking, and enjoying the fall foliage.\nRita was predeceased by her daughter, Jane Winkley; granddaughter, Jennifer Winkley; sister, Irene LeBlanc; sister, Lorraine Janas and her husband Tom, brother Fred LeBlanc, sister-in-law, Theresa Picard and her husband Fred, and brother-in-law Arthur Carboneau.\nShe is survived by her husband of 58 years, Ronald Eccles; son, John Eccles and his wife Leanne Eccles of Scarborough; grandchildren, Nichole Garfield, Ava Eccles and Cameron Eccles; as well as her four great-grandchildren. Rita is also survived by her sister, Diane Dionne and her husband Paul of Lewiston, sister-in-law, Claire Carboneau of Florida; and numerous nieces and nephews.\nThe family extends heartfelt gratitude to the staff at Alfond Center for Health, especially Dr. Brooks, for their exceptional care and compassion. Special thanks are also extended to Dr. Emmanuel N. Soultanakis and the staff at Maine Medical Partners Oncology Center in Scarborough.\nRelatives and friends may visit on Tuesday, Jan. 2 from 9 – 10:30 a.m. at Plummer Funeral Home, 16 Pleasant St., Augusta. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on Tuesday, Jan. 2 at 11 a.m. at St. Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church, Western Ave., Augusta. A burial will be held at a later date at St. Peter Cemetery, Lewiston.\nCondolences, stories and photos may be shared at\nhttp://www.plummerfh.com.\nSuccess. Please wait for the page to reload.

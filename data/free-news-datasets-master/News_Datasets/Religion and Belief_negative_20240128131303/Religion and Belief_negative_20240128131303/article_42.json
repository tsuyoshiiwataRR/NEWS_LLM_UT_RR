    "text": "When people think of a safe place to let their guard down, places of worship are high on that list for many, especially in a country where churches, mosques, synagogues and temples are abundant.\nHowever, for some religious institutions in Canada, they’re facing mounting hardships from taking care of those in need.\nFor half a year, volunteers and staff from multiple churches in Toronto have been working insane hours and paying out of pocket to feed and shelter hundreds of refugees who showed up at their doorstep.\nREAD MORE: ‘I have never seen these conditions,’ A shelter worker is sounding the alarm on how Black African refugees are living in Toronto\nNorth York’s Dominion Church and Etobicoke’s Pilgrim Feast Tabernacle have\nreportedly seen growing concerns and have endured mental breakdowns and personal credit card debt, according to the Toronto Star.\nLast month, Now Toronto\nspoke with a shelter worker who visited Etobicoke’s Pilgrim Feast Tabernacle and shared, and showed in a video, how Black refugees in the city are living, describing the conditions as something she’s never seen before.\n“I went inside and saw all of the suitcases stacked from the floor to the ceiling. People were sleeping on the floor,” Toronto social worker Ubah Idle told Now Toronto in November.\nREAD MORE: Toronto to open 250 shelter spaces for unhoused refugees\nNadine Miller, a director at Pilgrim Feast Tabernacle, told Now Toronto that things have taken an ugly turn as she feels refugees have been horribly abandoned by the Canadian government.\n“They’ve taken advantage and have violated the people of God,” she said in an interview on Thursday.\n“We’re not supposed to see someone in need and leave them on the streets. Whether a church or a mosque.”\nIn fact, according to Miller, some refugees are sleeping in mosques and eating in churches.\nShe says the treatment she’s witnessed is a clear violation of the\nGeneva Convention, which in short is international humanitarian laws consisting of protocols such as providing minimum protections, standards of humane treatment, and fundamental guarantees of respect to individuals who become victims of armed conflicts, in this case, refugees.\n“It’s the math of injustice.They need to look at this as a crisis.”\nTo paint a picture, Miller shares that in the first two weeks of welcoming refugees in July alone, the church had spent $250,000.\nSince then, the government has only reimbursed Pilgrim Feast Tabernacle a little over $280,000, she says.\nMiller confirms that now they are over $800,000 in debt.\nShe also says the city won’t reimburse the full amount because she hired staff and security to help with day-to-day operations of caring for hundreds of refugees as well as keeping everyone safe, a move the city apparently did not agree on.\n“We have 18 staff members who work 16 hours and only get paid for eight hours,” she shared.\nWith the funds given by the city, the church first pays the rent, then drops around $2,000 into the accounts of staff members (who are owed much more than that) and some goes to paying off debts.\nThe rest is allocated to continuing to care for refugees. And when donations aren’t enough, her team goes out and buys what’s needed out of their own pockets.\n“Think of a grocery bill for a family of four to six, now think about 100 people that you are now feeding.”\nMiller says the church was ready to close its doors this week, but the outpour that came from the announcement was enough to make her re-think that decision.\n“We wanted to close the doors today. But the calls we were getting and the cries from refugees, we decided to stay open.”\nRight now, she is looking to relocate to a new unit and go from paying $39,000 a month in rent to $15,000 instead.\n“We’re at the point of worry. We’re not millionaires.”\nMiller added that many refugees fear being taken to city shelters where they are at risk of being harassed, robbed and abused to a greater degree because they are newcomers.\nOverall, Miller believes a lot of the lack of care shown towards Black refugees is a direct result of racism, and that if it were any other group in crisis, the city would move “heaven and Earth.”\nIn November, the City of Toronto told Now Toronto that it meets weekly with the Pilgrim Feast Tabernacle to discuss ways of helping. And at the time, the city confirmed at least one payment of $150,000 was given back to the church.\n“This is one of a handful of churches that stepped forward to provide temporary emergency shelter, food, clothing and a sense of community to many asylum claimants from African countries until more permanent solution could be arranged,” Senior Communications Advisor with the City of Toronto Erin Whitton said in an email statement.",

Memorials can be mailed to the Scott Dickens Memorial Fund, c/o Vandemore Funeral homes & crematory, 580 E. Ogden avenue, Geneseo, II, 61254. The most important thing in the world to Scott was carol and the twenty years of life they built together.\nScott was born on March 21, 1968 in Monmouth, Il, to the late Richard (Jr.) and Tamara Dickens. Scott is survived by his wife, carol Punkiewicz; three children, Jason (Nikki) Punkiewicz, Jory (Steph) Punkiewicz, and amber (Elliott) punkiewicz, as well as his 11 beloved grandchildren. he is also survived by his stepmom, sherry Dickens; his sisters, heather (Joel) Francque, Jackie (Brian) Beach; stepsister, Wendy (Mark) einsweiler, and stepbrother, Steve (Betsy) VanDerschaaf. he was preceded in death by his parents and mother-in-law, Colene Wilson. he had many aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, nephews and good friends who loved him dearly.\nPeople are also readingâ€¦\nHe graduated from J.D. Darnall high school, class of 1986. he attended northwestern university, and then began his career in the casino industry, working in management at el Cortez hotel and casino, las Vegas, NV, The isle of Capri, Bettendorf, IA, Suncruz casino, Myrtle Beach, SC, and the IP in Biloxi, Ms. he met carol when they worked together at the isle of Capri. he was recently employed at the golden nugget casino in lake Charles, la, up until 6 months ago, when health issues prevented him from working.\nAlways curious, Scott found humor in the likes of Blazing saddles, but also enjoyed star Trek and star Wars, historical documentaries, and current events. Scott loved relaxing on the beach with carol, played a solid game of chess and euchre, and cheered for the Bears unconditionally. he found entertainment in a good, bad movie. a kid at heart, he favored captain America and Batman t-shirts. he was a fan of The Beatles, especially the song, \"let it Be,\" and classic rock. cerebral in nature, wicked smart, gentle giant.\nHe was a loyal friend you could count on, described like a brother to those who knew him best. he was the guy who gave the noisiest (and favorite) gifts to his grandkids, nieces and nephews. he was the brother who, when you were perpetually late getting ready for school, would step on the gas ever so slightly, until he finally let you get in the car at the end of the Cul-de-sac on Mockingbird ct. he was the gracious patient who didn't complain and always said thank you. he was the son who was at his mom and dad's bedside when they passed away. he was the Grampi who challenged his grandkids with equations, told dad jokes, and occasionally encouraged a bit of mischief. he was the husband who loved his life with carol.",

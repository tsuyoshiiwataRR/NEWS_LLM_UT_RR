    "text": "Donald Wildmon, founder of the American Family Association, a conservative Christian advocacy group, dies\nTUPELO, miss. — Donald Wildmon, founder of the American Family Association, a conservative Christian advocacy group, has died, the organization announced Thursday.\nThe 85-year-old Mississippi native died Thursday of complications related to Lewy body dementia, according to an obituary published by WTVA-TV. Wildmon died in Tupelo, Mississippi, the city where the American Family Association is headquartered. The obituary referred to Wildmon as “one of the legendary leaders of American conservatism.”\n“His impressive legacy of Christian ministry will endure for many years to come,” Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, said on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nWildmon founded the AFA, first known as the National Federation for Decency, in 1977 after working as a pastor of the United Methodist Church.\nSince its inception, the conservative advocacy group has launched campaigns and boycotts to pressure corporations to avoid supporting causes the group opposes, such as anti-LGBT discrimination measures.\nIn 1991, Wildmon launched American Family Radio, which installed radio stations throughout the United States to spread the AFA message. Wildmon led the AFA for 33 years, the obituary said. He resigned in 2010 and his son, Tim Wildmon, now runs the organization.",

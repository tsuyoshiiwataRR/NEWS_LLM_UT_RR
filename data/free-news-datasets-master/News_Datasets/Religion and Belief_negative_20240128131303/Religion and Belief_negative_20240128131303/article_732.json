It was supposed to take place in early 2024, but it \"is still being prepared,\" Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf said on December 27. Algiers still finds that the conditions for carrying out this visit are not met. This depends on the resolution of five major issues that are still being debated.

(Illustrative photo) AFP - LUDOVIC MARIN By: RFI Follow Advertising Read More This visit was supposed to confirm the improvement between the two countries, after many diplomatic crises. But the conditions are still not met, and Algiers is making it clear this time through its foreign minister, Ahmed Attaf. The latter affirmed this in an interview given on Wednesday evening 27 December to the podcast platform Atheer, owned by the Qatari channel Al-Jazeera. \"We have not reached agreements on five major and heavy issues,\" said the Algerian foreign minister, who added, however, that work continues and that visits between officials of the two countries are continuing. Among these pending files is the one on French nuclear tests in the Algerian Sahara. France carried out 17 of them between 1960 and 1966 at the Reggane site, then at In Ekker. Documents declassified in 2013 spoke of significant radioactive effects that spread from West Africa to southern Europe. Algeria is asking for \"recognition of the damage it has suffered as a result of its tests\", as well as compensation. Also, France still refuses, according to Algiers, to hand over the sword and burnous of Emir Abdelkader, arguing the need for a law, says the Algerian diplomat. However, according to the programme of the visit, President Tebboune was to go to the castle of Ambroise, where Abdelkader was imprisoned. The other two files concern mobility and visa issues between the two countries, as well as economic cooperation.

    "text": "PETALING JAYA: Beruas DAP MP Datuk Ngeh Koo Ham has gone overboard with his proposal to include a non-Muslim in the special committee to look into the competency of the Selangor state assembly to draw up Islamic laws, says Wan Ahmad Fayshal Wan Ahmad Kamal ( pic ).\nThe Bersatu Youth chief said Ngeh's statement was shallow and ignorant of the Constitution.\n\"As a member of the Parliament, he should know that matters regarding Islam are under the purview of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and the Malay Rulers.\n\"Syariah laws need to be discussed, managed and enforced by Muslims. It does not involve non-Muslims,\" he said in a statement on Friday (Dec 29).\nWan Ahmad Fayshal said Ngeh's proposal could create public uneasiness, especially among Muslims, if non-Muslims were involved in the process of drawing up Islamic laws, something which could be viewed as interfering in Islamic affairs.\n\"If Ngeh is really concerned about the competency of the state assembly to draw up Islamic laws, he can suggest Islamic experts.\n\"The committee has the approval of Sultan of Selangor Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah, who is the national council chairman of Malaysian Islamic Affairs.\n\"Work has already begun. As such Ngeh should withdraw his proposal and openly apologise,\" added Wan Ahmad Fayshal.\nOpen Modal Ã—",

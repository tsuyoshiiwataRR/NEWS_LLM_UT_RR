    "text": "The Methodist Church of Great Britain recently revised its “Inclusive Language Guide,” encouraging ministers, deacons, and elders to use terms like “partner,” “child,” and “parent” instead of “husband” and “wife.” This move aims to reflect the diversity of relationships and avoid assumptions not applicable to many people. The church’s initiative is part of an ongoing effort to prevent the use of language that could be harmful to marginalized groups. The guide, updated every six months, now includes recommendations on gender identity, advocating the use of chosen pronouns to respect individual identities. Additionally, traditional terms like “brothers and sisters” are advised against, considering non-binary individuals. The guidance extends to congregants, encouraging the use of personal pronouns in daily conversations. For further guidance on language and pronouns, particularly concerning the LGBT community, the church suggests consulting organizations such as GLAAD and Stonewall. This latest update follows the church’s 2021 decision to support same-sex marriages, marking a significant shift in its approach to contemporary social issues.",

    "text": "*Radio DJ Peter Rosenberg believes music executives pressured Kanye West to apologize to Jewish people ahead of the release of his new album “Vulture.” West returned to Instagram on December 26 to issue an apology in Hebrew. The message read, “I sincerely apologize to the Jewish community for any ‘unintended outburst.’ I did not intend to hurt or demean, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused. I am committed to starting with myself and learning from this experience to ensure greater sensitivity and understanding in the future. Your forgiveness is important to me, and I am committed to making amends and promoting unity.” Rosenberg isn’t convinced the rapper is being genuine. “I thought, ‘I wonder what the sample is that Kanye needs to try to clear before Friday.’ We all know Kanye notoriously is late with handling album stuff,” [he told TMZ](https://www.tmz.com/2023/12/27/dj-peter-rosenberg-blasts-kanye-west-apology-antisemitic/). “I just wonder whether there was something getting held up. And someone said, ‘Hey, this sample does not get cleared if he does not issue an apology.’ Like you guys said, he just goes on chat GPT and boom we get a quote apology,” Rosenberg added. Rosenberg called “the Hebrew part” of Ye’s message “offensive.” “I totally agree by the way that the Hebrew part was like so, either intentionally or unintentionally, offensive. As if American Jews can just read Hebrew without vowels. Like bro, it’s just another offensive thing here,” he said. Watch his conversation with TMZ via the clip above. As we reported… West recently announced his new website, [Yews.news](https://www.yews.news/), will keep fans updated about his forthcoming album. According to reports, “Vulture” will drop on February 15, featuring Lil Durk, Kodak Black, and Ty Dolla Sign. Meanwhile, critics are accusing West of using the popular AI tool ChatGPT to write his Hebrew apology. Per [The Blast](https://theblast.com/566249/kanye-west-apology-to-jews-allegedly-ai-generated/), “… ChatGPT is not known to duplicate an answer, which means photos of the apology being replicated by the AI are likely photoshopped.” READ MORE: [Kanye West Apologizes to Jewish People: ‘I Am Committed to Making Amends’ ](https://eurweb.com/2023/kanye-west-apologizes-to-jewish-people-i-am-committed-to-making-amends/) We Publish News 24/7.

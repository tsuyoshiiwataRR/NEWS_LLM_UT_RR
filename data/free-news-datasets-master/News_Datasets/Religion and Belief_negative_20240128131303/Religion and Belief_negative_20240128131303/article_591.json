    "text": "‘Incorrect translation’: Assam CM Himanta Sarma apologises after his post on Vaishyas, Shudras triggers row\nTwo days after his social media post on “Swabhabik Karma” or “natural duties” of Vaishyas and Shudras triggered a row, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday apologised for the post and deleted it saying that one of his team members had posted a verse from the Bhagavad Gita with an “incorrect translation”.\nSarma also sought to emphasise that Assam has a “casteless society” due to the social reforms spearheaded by Shrimant Sankardeva, who is considered a major spiritual leader in the state.\nTaking to X, formerly Twitter, chief minister Sarma wrote, “As a routine I upload one sloka of Bhagavad Gita every morning on my social media handles. Till date, I have posted 668 slokas. Recently one of my team members posted a sloka from Chapter 18 verse 44 with an incorrect translation. As soon as I noticed the mistake, I promptly deleted the post. The state of Assam reflects a perfect picture of a casteless society, thanks to the reform movement led by Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardeva…”.\n“…If the deleted post has offended anyone, I sincerely apologize,” he added.\nOn December 26, the BJP leader had posted a verse on his X handle which can be translated as follows, “Bhagwan Shri Krishna himself describes the natural duties of Vaishya and Shudras”. Sarma had also posted a video citing the 44th verse from ‘Sanyas Jog’ in the 18th chapter of the Gita. The video explains that agriculture, cow rearing and business are the “natural duties” of Vaishyas, while serving Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas is the “natural duty” of Shudras.\nSharply criticising the post, the CPI(M) shared a screenshot of it and wrote, “We strongly denounce Assam CM Himanta Biswas tweet claiming that “Shudras are to serve Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas”.\nIn its post on X, the Communist party also slammed the chief minister’s statement, calling it “BJPs Manuvadi ideology in full play”.\nMeanwhile, Sarma put up another verse from the Gita on Friday in continuation of his daily posts from the Hindu scripture.\nFor the latest news from across India, Political updates, Explainers, Sports News, Opinion, Entertainment Updates and more Top News, visit Indian Express.

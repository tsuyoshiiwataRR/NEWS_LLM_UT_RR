    "text": "Suhail Bhat SRINAGAR, Dec 28: A 17th-century Mughal-era Masjid in the Malshahi Bagh area of Ganderbal district is currently in a state of disrepair, prompting locals to call for its immediate renovation to safeguard this invaluable historical asset. Despite being designated as a protected monument in 2021 due to its cultural and historical significance, the Masjid has not seen improvements in its condition and continues to deteriorate. Known locally as the Jinn Masjid, it was built by Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of Mughal Emperor Shahjahan, for his spiritual mentor and saint Mullah Shah Badakhshi. However, the monument now requires urgent attention, having developed cracks over centuries of exposure to snow and rain. The lack of proper oversight has turned the Masjid into a haven for anti-social elements, as per locals, even though it falls under the care of the Jammu and Kashmir Wakf Board. The locals alleged that the Muslim body has been unable to maintain this architectural gem, and the Masjid’s condition worsens day by day. “We urge the Government to preserve this culturally significant mosque,” Noor Mohammad, a local, said. [Click here to watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km6a845cByU) He said that the Masjid is located within a 360-kanal apple, plum, and walnut orchard, and while the Wakf gladly accepts returns from the orchard, it appears to be indifferent to the upkeep of this heritage site, “We have brought up the issue with the Wakf Board several times, but no action has been taken so far,” he said. Locals attribute the delayed renovation of the mosque to the laid-back attitude of the Waqf Board. “During our visit to the Waqf Board, they informed us that the Masjid is under the jurisdiction of another department. Although their officials visited the site and issued tenders for the renovation project, the Awqaf is still sitting on it,” a local said. The Chairperson of the Jammu and Kashmir Wakf Board, Darakshan Andrabi, clarified that the Masjid has been declared a protected monument and falls under the purview of the Archaeological Survey of India. “We cannot undertake the renovation independently; otherwise, we would have already done so. While we are aware of the condition of the Masjid, we share the community’s desire for its preservation,” she said.",

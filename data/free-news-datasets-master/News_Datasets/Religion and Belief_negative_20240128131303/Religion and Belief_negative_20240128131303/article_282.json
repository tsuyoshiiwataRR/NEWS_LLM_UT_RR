    "text": "Assam: Conversion in Majuli worries xatra body Sanatan Dharma leaders are concerned about the conversion of tribal people in Majuli from Hinduism to Christianity and said this needs to be studied and the trend arrested, said the Asom Sattra Mahasabha. STAFF REPORTER GUWAHATI: Sanatan Dharma leaders are concerned about the conversion of tribal people in Majuli from Hinduism to Christianity and said this needs to be studied and the trend arrested, said the Asom Sattra Mahasabha. The tribal people of Majuli, mainly those from the Mising community, have lately been converting to Christianity in large numbers, and this has set the alarm bells ringing in Sanatan Dharma circles, it was stated. The Asom Sattra Mahasabha pointed out that the Majuli LAC is currently reserved for STs and that it should be dereserved so that people from the general community can participate in elections. Talking to The Sentinel, secretary-general of the Asom Sattra Mahasabha, Kusum Kumar Mahanta, said, \"The strains of Borgeet can still be heard in Majuli, but the chorus of carols is also becoming more audible. Christian missionaries are making inroads into the tribal communities, and they are enticing the tribal people with money, education and medical facilities, etc. But once someone is converted, they are no longer given any attention. So, organizations linked to the Sanatan Dharma are looking for ways to stop this conversion and bring the tribal people back to their fold.\" \"The [xatras ](https://www.sentinelassam.com/north-east-india-news/assam-news/commission-for-review-assessment-visits-xatras-in-lakhimpur-681877)in Majuli also have a responsibility to ensure that the conversion stops. There may be a conspiracy in the conversion process, and this angle should be examined by the state government,\" he asserted. He also pointed out that the number of Christians among the tribal populace is increasing, and coupled with the fact that the LAC is reserved for STs, there should be a rethink by the government to dereserve the LAC.

    "text": "Kidnappers storm Ogun mosque, abduct cleric, businessman An eight-man kidnapping gang has invaded a mosque and abducted one Murithador Sadullahi Akanho Olamide, the Imam of Muhadul-iftai-wa-sadah Institute of Arabic and Islamic studies. Also abducted was a businessman, Olayemi Arasi, who is the Chief Executive Officer of Hollarams Technical Services Ltd. The incident happened in the Lufuape area, along Sagamu Interchange, Ogun State. The Guardian learnt that the hoodlums targeted the mosque during Friday night prayers and forcibly took the cleric and the businessman to an undisclosed location. The victims were, however, released after spending three days in captivity, following the payment of a ransom by their families. A family source said the kidnappers, suspected to be foreigners, had targeted the cleric but seized the opportunity to abduct the businessman. There are also indications that they had connived with some locals. The source, who was involved in payment of the ransom, revealed that a substantial amount was paid to secure the release of both men. Kidnappings have reportedly become frequent in the area, which is home to several industries. The source called on the government to take decisive steps to prevent further abductions, saying the development could scare off investors. Spokesperson for the Ogun State Police Command, Omolola Odutola, who confirmed the incident, however, expressed ignorance about ransom details. She assured the public of ongoing efforts to track down the kidnappers. Odutola emphasised the commitment of police towards addressing criminal activities and urged collaboration to ensure the safety of citizens. Asked whether the command was taking action to apprehend the perpetrators, she said: “Yes, the command is aware, and no Commissioner of Police would tolerate such incidents. We are always prepared to track down kidnappers, and we have been consistently doing so. “When discussing individuals from Niger and (of) Fulani (extraction), the police do not make discriminatory statements. Our primary concern is apprehending those responsible for criminal acts.” Get the latest news delivered straight to your inbox every day of the week.

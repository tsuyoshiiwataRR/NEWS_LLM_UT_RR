    "text": "New Delhi: Ahead of the scheduled inauguration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya next month, slogans demanding the rebuilding of the Babri Masjid have surfaced on the walls of the Language Study Centre at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Students on Wednesday night saw these slogans on the campus, and photos of the graffiti were widely shared on social media on Thursday. The slogans were found above the name of the National Students' Union of India (NSUI), the Congress's student wing.However, the NSUI distanced itself from the controversy. Sudhanshu Shekhar, the president of NSUI's JNU unit, pointed out that the organization's name was already present in black marker, and the slogans were added later in red marker. Shekhar alleged that this was an attempt to tarnish NSUI's image and called for stringent action from the JNU administration.JNU's chief security officer, Naveen Yadav, claimed to be unaware of the incident. He mentioned that slogans targeting a specific caste had been written a few months ago, but no investigation had taken place. There was no immediate response from the JNU vice-chancellor and the registrar.Previous incidents at JNU include anti-Brahmin slogans like 'There will be blood' painted on the walls of the School of Languages and School of International Studies last December, and messages related to Kashmir found two months ago. Satish Garkoti, rector of JNU, had mentioned a committee's formation to look into repeated incidents of \"anti-national\" slogans on the campus and the installation of CCTVs in strategic locations.The revised Chief Proctor Office manual has a provision for a fine of Rs 10,000 for writing controversial slogans. However, the Language Study Centre does not have CCTV coverage to check the defacement of walls.",

    "text": "Same-sex marriage is an \" abominable practice \", gay couples are to be \" stoned \" because they have \" chosen the devil \" and attract the divine \" curse \": Burundian President Évariste Ndayishimiye on Friday (December 29th) delivered a virulent diatribe against homosexuality.\nThe head of state of this conservative Christian African country, where same-sex relations are punishable by up to two years in prison, was speaking at a public conference in the eastern province of Cankuzo broadcast on radio and television, answering questions from the press and the population.\n«\nYou asked me a question about this abominable practice of one man marrying another man and a woman marrying another woman ,\" he said, before referring to the Bible. \" I'm telling you the truth, if you want to bring the curse on a country, you have to let people of the same sex get married. Remember what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah? God then came to say, 'I regret having created man,' \" he added.\n«\nPersonally, I think that if we see this kind of people in Burundi, we should put them in a stadium and stone them. And it wouldn't be a sin for those who do,\" said Ndayishimiye, who earlier this year called for homosexuals to be \" banned \" and \" treated as pariahs .\"\n\"Don't let them come back!\" He also lashed out at Western countries, which routinely display their opposition to violations of the rights of the LGBTQ+ community. In Uganda, another East African country, a law passed by parliament in May harshly punishing homosexual practices and the \" promotion of homosexuality \" drew strong Western condemnation and sanctions from the United States.\n«\nYou said that Western countries are trying to force small countries to adopt this practice, and that they will not receive any help if they do not comply. Let them keep their help, let them keep it!\" he said.\n«\nWhoever has chosen the devil, let him go and live in these lands. Moreover, I believe that those who go into exile in these countries go there to adopt these practices (...) Don't let them come back!\" he also said. Burundi's penal code punishes same-sex relations, punishable by fines and penalties ranging from three months to two years in prison.\nIn March, 24 people were charged with \"homosexual practices or incitement to homosexual practices \" and imprisoned. Seven of them were sentenced, five to two years in prison and two others to one year in prison.\nIn East Africa, as in many countries on the continent, LGBTQ+ people face stigma and discrimination in conservative societies, whether predominantly Christian or Muslim, where homosexuality is taboo.",

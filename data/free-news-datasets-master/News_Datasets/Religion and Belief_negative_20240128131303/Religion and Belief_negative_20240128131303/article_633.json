    "text": "The Islamic community in Bosnia and Herzegovina announced that its members, as well as the majority of citizens of BiH, are deeply disturbed by the latest statements of Milorad Dodik, who, as they state, admitted that he has ready plans for the secession of part of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that he is just waiting for any reason for it. They state that the public is no less worried about the announcements of the disempowerment of the state and the confiscation of its property, which, along with putting the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina under political control, would be an essential act of secession. The Islamic community welcomed the resolute position of the administration of the United States of America (USA), especially those expressed in the statement of the US Embassy in Sarajevo and the speech of the US Assistant Secretary of State and Head of the Office for Europe and Eurasia James O’Brien. ”With its clear position that the USA will act if someone tries to change the basic element of Dayton and violate the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United States of America proves that it is a sincere friend of this country and someone who is aware of the importance of the hard-won peace in this part of Europe,” it is said in the statement of the Public Relations Office of the Islamic Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Islamic community called on domestic politicians to take responsibility for the new situation and prepare a response to any attempt to undermine peace, the Dayton Agreement and the territorial integrity of the country. “This is, first of all, the obligation of domestic politicians and state institutions, and only then of our friends in the world. Other international actors, especially the European Union and its members, are also expected to take these threats to stability seriously and not to minimize them, but to clearly express their determination to stop dangerous and irresponsible policies and their holders, and to put an end to them. give in, please and thus encourage them to continue with the dangerous adventure that is dictated from who knows which power centers,” it was stated in the statement.",

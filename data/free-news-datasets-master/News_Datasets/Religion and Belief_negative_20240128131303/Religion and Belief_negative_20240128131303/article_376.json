    "text": "Lakshmi Narayan Temple Chief Attacked in Canada: In a worrying incident, Satish Kumar, the president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey, Canada, was reportedly targeted in a shooting. Recent TV reports revealed that at least 14 gunshots hit Kumar's home on Thursday night. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but the incident has raised concerns within the community.The incident led the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to quickly start an investigation, looking into the details of the attack. They gathered evidence, interviewed witnesses, and checked for any CCTV footage that could provide more information.Speaking to Times Now, Satish Kumar explained that the incident happened at his son's home. He mentioned that the police are currently investigating and didn't speculate on who might be behind the attack. He also clarified that this incident doesn't seem directly connected to the previous attack on the temple, suggesting it might be linked to extortion.Attacks on Canadian Hindu TemplesThis isn't the first time Lakshmi Narayan Mandir has faced trouble. It's the third attack linked to Khalistani supporters. The shooting is seen as a response to a protest organised by the temple against Khalistani extremists. In January, anti-India graffiti on a Hindu temple in Brampton sparked widespread outrage within the Indian community.Earlier in February, anti-India graffiti vandalized the Ram Mandir in Mississauga, Canada. The Consulate General of India in Toronto strongly condemned the vandalism and urged Canadian authorities to promptly investigate and take action against the culprits.In April of this year, the BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, was defaced with anti-India graffiti.In August too, a Hindu temple was vandalised by extremist elements with Khalistan referendum posters in Canada.A Hindu temple was also vandalised in Canada by extremist elements with Khalistan referendum posters in August.India-Canada Diplomatic Row Canada and India witnessed significant strains in their relation after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's shocking allegations in September of the potential involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar on June 18, whom India had designated Nijjar as a terrorist in 2020.India had rejected Trudeau's allegations of Nijjar's murder as absurd and motivated .India and Canada's longstanding and historic relationship spiraled into a diplomatic dispute following accusations against the Indian government concerning its alleged role in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.Two men who investigators suspect fatally shot Khalistani leader Nijjar in British Columbia are under police surveillance and are anticipated to be arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in a matter of weeks, the Canadian daily The Globe and Mail reported this week.Nijjar KillingHardeep Singh Nijjar, aged 45, was attacked and suffered multiple gunshot wounds while departing from a Sikh temple in Surrey on June 18. Reports suggest that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service had previously warned the Sikh separatist leader about potential threats to his life.The sources said police will explain the alleged involvement of the accused individuals and that of the Indian government when charges are laid against the two men, the Canadian media house reported.India's foreign ministry spokesperson, Arindam Bagchi, conveyed in a strongly-worded letter in October that Canada needs to worry about its international reputation following the explosive allegations of Nijjar murder. The issue is the incitement of violence, the inaction by the Canadian authorities, the creation of an environment that disrupts the functioning of our high commission and consulates--that's what's making us temporarily stop the issuance of visas or providing visa service .",

    "text": "An anti-LGBTQ+ hate preacher has lashed out at Fox News, describing the right-wing media outlet as “crooked” because it isn’t anti-LGBTQ+ enough. On December 4, writer Hemant Mehta, who covers religion and politics via his Friendly Atheist newsletter and podcast, posted a clip from one of hate-preacher Joe Jones’s sermons. Jones is the pastor of the Shield of Faith Baptist Church in Boise, Idaho. He has previously gone viral for a slur-laced sermon in which he called for LGBTQ+ people to be put to death and claimed that “sodomites are reptilians.” Related: [Pastor preaches that all gay men are “reptilians” & should be put to death] “I’m not saying that every reptilian is a sodomite, but all sodomites are reptilians.” In the more recent sermon, Jones asked his congregation, “Don’t you find it kinda strange that virtually every media outlet is crooked in some way, shape, or form?” Never Miss a Beat [Subscribe to our daily newsletter]to stay ahead of the latest LGBTQ+ political news and insights. But rather than smearing mainstream or even left-leaning media outlets, Jones took aim at Fox News. “You might say, ‘Well, what about Fox News?’” he continued. “Well, Fox News is crooked. And I think we’d all agree on that. You know, Fox News is crooked. Are they gonna tell you that we need to get rid of the sodomites? No. But everybody in here knows if we were able to get rid of the sodomites out of this nation, it would be better overnight. Life would be vastly better overnight. Pedophilia would be down — I mean, just overnight.” Jones has been more explicit in what he means by “get rid of” in the past. “The Bible says they are to be put to death,” he said in a 2022 YouTube video. In the truly unhinged sermon, he went on to echo both right-wing rhetoric falsely associating LGBTQ+ people with child sexual abuse and a conspiracy theory that the U.S. government is secretly controlled by reptilian humanoids from another planet. He claimed that it isn’t God’s fault “that all these pedophiles are around.” “He told nations how to deal with that. He told the nation that he ruled, ‘Put them to death. Put all queers to death,’” Jones said. “And you know what, when they die, that stops the pedophilia. It’s a very simple process, but of course our reptilian government, they don’t subscribe to that.” “I’m not saying that every reptilian is a sodomite, but all sodomites are reptilians,” he added. YouTube has since [removed the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqPA_0ZUmM8) for violating the platform’s hate speech policies.",

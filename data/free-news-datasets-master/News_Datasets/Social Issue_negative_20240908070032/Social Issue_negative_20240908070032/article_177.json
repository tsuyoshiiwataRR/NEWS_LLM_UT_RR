    "text": "By Justin Muszynski, Hartford Courant ,\n1 hour ago An inmate at a Connecticut correctional facility serving a 10-year prison term on kidnapping and other charges has been accused of violating a protective order issued on behalf of the victim when he allegedly called her twice from prison.\nThomas Ibbison, 37, was served with a warrant charging him with two counts of violation of a protective order after he was transported Wednesday to New London Superior Court, according to Connecticut State Police . He was arraigned later in the day on the new charges, and a judge set bail at $150,000.\nIbbison is a sentenced prisoner serving his term at the Cheshire Correctional Institution, according to state Department of Correction records. He was sentenced on Dec. 13, 2023, after pleading guilty to charges of second-degree kidnapping, tampering with a witness, violation of a protective order, second-degree strangulation, third-degree assault and second-degree threatening, court records show.\nIbbison was issued a protective order that barred him from contacting the victim in the case until December 2073. Based on the time served while he was held on bond in the previous cases, DOC records indicate he could be held until September 2029.\nAccording to the arrest warrant affidavit on the new charges, state police began investigating a complaint filed by the victim in June. The woman told police Ibbison had called her on consecutive days in April.\nShe said she knew it was a violation of the protective order, but she did not want to “make a big deal of it” until she received court paperwork indicating Ibbison was seeking visitation rights with someone whose identity has been redacted from the warrant affidavit.\nAccording to the warrant affidavit, the DOC was able to confirm three calls to the victim on April 6 and two more were made the next day. The phone system in the state’s prisons cuts off calls after 15 minutes, but it does not prevent an inmate from immediately calling back and starting a new call.\nState police in the warrant affidavit said they determined the five calls were placed during what essentially equated to two conversations on consecutive days. The pin number assigned to the account used to make the calls was associated with another inmate. State police said they were unable to determine a connection between Ibbison and the other inmate beyond that they were serving time at the same correctional facility.\nWhen state police interviewed the victim about the phone calls, she confirmed that the calls were made consecutively over multiple days during two conversations that she described as “civil,” the warrant affidavit said.\nDuring the calls, the victim told police Ibbison asked her to drop the protective order, which extended to someone whose identity is not included in a redacted version of the warrant affidavit. She told Ibbison she did not want to drop the order because she is afraid he will hurt her or the other protected person, the warrant affidavit said.\nWhen state police listened to recordings of the calls, they confirmed that they centered around Ibbison asking the victim to drop the protective order, the warrant affidavit said.\nDuring the call on April 6, the victim asked Ibbison to call her the next day, according to the warrant affidavit.\nDuring a call the next day, the victim told Ibbison she was worried he would “just go nuts” when he is released from prison, the warrant affidavit said. She told him, however, she would think about having the order dropped, according to the warrant affidavit.\nIbbison also mentioned during the call that he requested paperwork from family court, but he did not indicate why, the warrant affidavit said.\nDuring their investigation, state police also found that Ibbison, while incarcerated at the Corrigan Radgowski Correctional Center in 2019, used another inmate’s pin number to call the victim, according to the warrant affidavit. Ibbison later pleaded guilty to violating a protective order that was in place at the time, state police wrote.\nIbbison is expected to appear in court again on the new charges on Sept. 4. Court records indicate he did not enter a plea during his arraignment proceedings.\nFor more stories, Subscribe to Hartford Courant.\n©2024 Hartford Courant.

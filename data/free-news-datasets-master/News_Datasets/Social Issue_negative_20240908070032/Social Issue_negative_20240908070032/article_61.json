    "text": "The Kaduna State governor, Uba Sani, has vowed that his administration will ensure that Ismail Muhammad, a 16-year-old boy who was killed by a military officer during the ongoing protest, gets justice.\nDAILY POST recalls that the teenage boy was gunned down by a soldier on Tuesday when the troops of the Nigerian army stormed the Samaru community in Zaria to disperse the hunger protesters.\nThe army said in a statement on Wednesday that the erring officer has already been arrested and detained pending the conclusion of an investigation.\nSpeaking on the matter, the Kaduna governor, in a statement he signed on Thursday, assured Nigerians that the deceased would get justice.\nThe governor said that he earlier dispatched a high-powered delegation made up of top government officials and heads of security agencies to visit and condole with the family of the teenager.\n“The team was led by the Overseeing Commissioner for Internal Security, Samuel Aruwan.\n“While the team was with the family, I spoke on the phone with the father of the deceased, Muhammad Hussaini and expressed our deepest condolences.\n“I told him that we are deeply pained by the unfortunate incident and will leave no stone unturned to ensure that justice is served. A full and thorough investigation will be conducted and the culprit will be brought to book.\n“I will stay in close contact with the family of the deceased in these trying times,” the governor said.",

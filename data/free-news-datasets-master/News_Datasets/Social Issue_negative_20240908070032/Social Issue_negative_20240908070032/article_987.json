    "text": "MANSFIELD, La. -- Sheriff Jayson Richardson has issued a warning to those who dump animals: The state law prohibiting mistreatment of animals will be \"strongly\" enforced moving forward.\nHe's making the stance because of an abundance of reports of stray animals on the loose in various areas of the parish over the past three weeks. The incidents range from animals being randomly dumped out in or near residential areas, residents not properly containing their pets, animals damaging property, or animals becoming aggressive toward residents and/or their children.\n\"It is a situation that has become all to common in our area, and it is past time for it to be properly addressed,\" he said Thursday in a social media post.\nRichardson is taking steps now, and there may be more to come, to eliminate this problem. This notice, he said, serves as a reminder to all of Louisiana State Code RS 14:102.1 which \"we will be strongly enforcing from this point forward.\"\nThis code includes, but is not limited to: Anyone tormenting, beating, or injuring any animal whether it belongs to themselves or others. Unjustifiably failing to provide an animal with proper food, drink, shelter, or veterinary care. Anyone abandoning (or dumping) any animal, unless it is turned over to an animal control center. The code describes other incidences where someone can be held accountable by law enforcement for the mistreatment, dumping of, or not properly caring for an animal anywhere in the state. \"Therefore we are seeking the public's assistance to work alongside our office to combat this issue. We live in a world where security cameras and phones capture just about everything. If you witness someone dumping an animal, or manage to capture this crime in footage, we ask that you contact the DeSoto Parish Sheriff’s Office immediately at 318-872-3956 and make a report,\" Richardson said. If it is life-threatening a call should be made to 9-1-1. A deputy will be dispatched to the location and an investigation will be opened. \"The DeSoto Parish Sheriff’s Office will hold anyone accountable for not only the mistreatment of animals but also for littering our streets and placing residents in danger by dumping said animals as well,\" Richardson said. Punishment for these crimes can range from a fine to imprisonment or both, depending on the circumstances of the crime. Repetitive complaints or disregard for the laws as stated above will also be taken into consideration. Report a typo on this article",

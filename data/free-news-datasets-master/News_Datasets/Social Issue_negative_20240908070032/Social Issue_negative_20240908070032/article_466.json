    "text": "Church in exile: Leaving is the only solution to escape Sandinista oppression in Nicaragua The Catholic Church faces severe repression from Nicaragua's Sandinista regime for supporting the 2018 student movement and condemning human rights abuses. Threatened and harassed, over 200 religious leaders have been expelled or forced to flee, mainly to Costa Rica. The road to the border is a rough dirt track, nearly impassable during the rainy season. From the nearest small town, Upala, it takes about 20 bumpy minutes to reach the village that both unites and separates the two neighbors. A faded blue and white flag marks the entry into Nicaraguan soil; Sandinista regime soldiers usually stand guard in a small, deserted hut. Occasionally, residents of Upala brave the journey to buy clothes, fruits, and vegetables, which are half the price in the Nicaraguan shacks compared to Costa Rica. For decades, seasonal “nica” laborers have traveled the other way. Without them, sugarcane, coffee, and pineapples would rot in the fields. The importance of Nicaraguans is compared to that of Mexicans in the United States: they are the ones who, under a scorching sun with added humidity, do the hard labor that locals no longer want to do. Hundreds of thousands of exiles since 2018 Since April 2018, Upala has seen a new type of Nicaraguan: the political exile. The rejection of IMF-backed economic reforms led to fierce repression, hitting both Managua and the provinces, forcing hundreds of thousands into exile from a country of fewer than 7 million people. Among them are members of the only authority to have stood up to the regime: the Catholic Church. In April 2018, priests opened their churches to hunted students and, as much as they could, treated injuries caused by Sandinista batons and bullets. From the pulpit, they denounced numerous human rights abuses. As Daniel Ortega's regime descended into dictatorship, [this resistance](https://international.la-croix.com/news/world/siege-at-nicaragua-church-ends-after-priests-intervene-2-dead/7736) became intolerable for the government. Priests were imprisoned and harshly sentenced, a rarity in a predominantly Catholic country. Fearing the worst, many clergymen had no choice but to flee the country clandestinely to neighboring Costa Rica. Fleeing at night to avoid prison One such priest, now a refugee somewhere in Costa Rica, speaks anonymously to avoid retaliation against his family back home. “Threats and persecution haven't stopped since 2018,” he said. “I was in Managua when the cathedral was attacked by Sandinistas in 2019, and a priest was injured.” Over the years, the pressure on him increased until August 2023. “Anti-riot forces came to the church where I was going to deliver a homily. I thought they were going to arrest me. But it didn't happen. It was intimidation.” Afterward, the harassment was constant. Late last year, through a close friend, he learned of an imminent arrest. Thanks to a relative's intervention, he narrowly escaped the first attempt to arrest him, already in handcuffs like a criminal. A stroke of luck. He then chose to flee, ignoring his bishop's advice to surrender. “It pains me to say this, but he's an ally of the regime,” he said cautiously. “Many people around him have jobs thanks to the regime.” Under cover of night, taking back roads to evade Sandinista police and soldiers, he left his loved ones behind. Systematic weakening of the church since 2023 According to the Nicaragua Nunca Mas (Never Again) collective, founded by human rights activists in exile in Costa Rica, more than 200 religious figures have been forced to leave Nicaragua. More priests are expected to arrive on this side of the border soon. “Since February 2023, with the expulsion to the United States and stripping 222 people of [their citizenship](https://international.la-croix.com/news/world/nicaragua-19-priests-religious-stripped-of-their-citizenship/18469), including priests and seminarians, a new level of repression has been reached,” explained Salvador Marenco, the collective's spokesperson. “The goal now is to weaken the church systematically.” Since 2018, these attacks have taken various forms. “Initially, the regime used threats and insults,” Marenco explained. “Then, in March 2019, the exile began with the departure of Bishop Silvio Baez, auxiliary bishop of Managua, threatened with death. It was also the time of the first closures of Catholic organizations and physical assaults.” In March 2022, there was a rupture with the expulsion of the apostolic nuncio. Priests were imprisoned; Bishop Rolando Alvarez of Matagalpa was arrested, and Catholic universities were closed. According to Nicaragua Nunca Mas, “the justice system has prosecuted 65 religious figures, and more than 400 church-affiliated organizations have been shut down.” Followers also targeted Today, even the faithful are targeted by the authorities, although the church remains silent, likely due to negotiations between the Vatican and the regime. According to some sources, 13 people were recently sentenced for attending religious events, with few details available. Initially, the regime sought to associate political power with major Catholic celebrations, especially processions, which are significant in Nicaragua. For example, an evangelical mayor presided over the Santo Domingo procession in Managua. But since then, new restrictions have been imposed on religious freedom. “They first limited the procession to around churches,” said Nuriz Sequeira, a peasant activist from the south of the country who is now a refugee in Upala. Now, it's not even possible: processions can only be held inside churches.” For the aging Sandinista dictator Daniel Ortega, Catholicism must disappear from the landscape in all its forms. -",

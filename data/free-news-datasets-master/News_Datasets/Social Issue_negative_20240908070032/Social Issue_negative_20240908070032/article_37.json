    "text": "STORY: :: Trump mocks the size of Harris' campaign\ncrowds, even though his are similar\n:: August 8, 2024\n:: Palm Beach, Florida\nREPORTER: \"Are you worried at all about the size of Harris' crowds?\"\nTRUMP: \"Oh, give me a break. Listen, I had 107,000 people in new Jersey. You didn't report it. I'm so glad you asked. What did you have yesterday? 2000 people. If I ever had 2000 people, you'd say my campaign is finished. It's so dishonest, the press. And here's a great example, I had in Michigan recently 25,000 people, and 25,000 people we just couldn't get them in. We had in Harrisburg 20-25,000 people and 20,000 people couldn't get in. We had so many. Nobody ever mentions that...\"\nThe news conference was Trump's first public appearance since Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday.\nHarris, the U.S. vice president, and Walz have headlined rallies in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this week, drawing tens of thousands of attendees in a fresh sign of how her late entry into the race has re-energized Democrats.\nShare Â© Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "Tropical Storm Debby will impact Bucks County weather. Could there be a tornado threat? [Tropical Storm Debby](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/08/debby-tropical-storm-updates/74716296007/) moved west overnight but continues to [roar toward Bucks County](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.2293&lon=-74.9367) with steady rain for Friday. The storm made landfall in South Carolina early Thursday morning and is near the border of North Carolina. According to the National Weather Service, the storm will track north into North Carolina as a Tropical Depression today and move through central Virginia on Friday morning. The storm will move into Pennsylvania on Friday and move on to New England on Saturday. Storm warning [Debby storm path: A look at the flooding, destruction storm has caused since landfall](https://www.phillyburbs.com/story/news/2024/08/08/debby-storm-path-of-destruction-florida-georgia-south-carolina-landfall-tracking-hurricane-debby/74719148007/) How will Tropical Storm Debby affect Bucks County? Debby will head into Lower Bucks County overnight Thursday. Heavier rains will fall by dawn Friday and continue through the day. Lower Bucks will see about 1.5 inches of rain throughout the day. The storm will clear out between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. Friday, said meteorologist Patrick O’Hara with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey. “Heavy rain, strong winds mainly Friday. There’s a chance of tornadoes that spin up across the area with these kinds of tropical systems, and the rains will be enough for local flooding,” he said. Lower Bucks County, [which has had between three and five inches of rain this week](https://www.phillyburbs.com/story/news/local/2024/08/07/bucks-county-weather-how-much-rain-fell-levittown-water-rescue-after-2-5-inches-rain-debby-pa/74701004007/), will see an additional 1.5 inches of rain. The heaviest rains will hit from Newtown and places north of it, receiving from 2 inches to 2.5 inches over the course of the day. Lower-lying places like Croydon, and along the Neshaminy Creek and Delaware River could see localized flooding, which will happen more quickly than normal, since the ground is already soaked. But there’s good news, too. “The weekend is going to be really nice, sunny and in the 80s,” O’Hara said. JD Mullane can be reached at 215-949-5745 or at jmullane@couriertimes.com.",

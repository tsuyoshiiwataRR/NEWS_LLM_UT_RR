    "text": "Health Rounds: Kids' sugary drink intake spikes worldwide Hello Health Rounds Readers! Many kids love sugary drinks, but a dramatic spike in consumption of these beverages by children and adolescents around the world - shown in one of the studies we feature today - is likely to significantly impact their health, according to researchers. Today we also highlight a study showing Down syndrome to be multiple subtly different conditions, and another study illustrating the risks of trying to get popular new weight loss drugs online. Unhealthy drink consumption by kids spikes worldwide Consumption of sugary drinks like sodas and other sweetened beverages by children and adolescents worldwide has increased dramatically, raising their short- and long-term risks for obesity and other diseases, according to researchers. Between 1990 and 2018, children ages 3 to 19 increased their consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages by an average of 23% (0.68 servings per week), with the largest increases in sub-Saharan Africa (2.17 servings per week), according to survey data from 185 countries analyzed by researchers at Tufts University in Boston. By 2018, their average global intake was 3.6 servings per week, ranging from 1.3 in South Asia to 9.1 in Latin America and the Caribbean. In nearly one-third of the 185 countries included in the analysis, the average intake was seven or more servings per week. The jump in sugary drink intake among youngsters was nearly twice as high as the rise in adults over the same period and corresponds to increased rates of obesity among young people, the researchers reported on Wednesday in The BMJ. Sugar-sweetened drinks were defined as any beverage with added sugars and at least 50 calories per 8-ounce (237-ml) serving, not including 100% fruit and vegetable juices or sweetened milk. The American Heart Association recommends that children 2 years and older consume no more than 8 ounces of sugary drinks per week. The researchers acknowledged that the survey data yielded imperfect estimates of food intake. Still, they concluded, their study shows that given the large differences in intake of sugary beverages among children and adolescents in various parts of the world, efforts to achieve reductions will need to be targeted to specific populations. Down syndrome is a group of conditions A new study has identified three different subtypes of Down syndrome, offering new insights that could lead to personalized medicine approaches for people with this genetic disorder. Down syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 and is associated with differences in neurodevelopment and distinct differences in risks for medical conditions. For example, people with Down syndrome have a significantly lower than average risk of most solid cancers and high blood pressure, but they have a significantly higher risk of autoimmune disorders and Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms underlying these differences have long perplexed medical and research communities. Studying genetic profiles of hundreds of individuals with Down syndrome, researchers identified different molecular signatures in immune function, cellular signaling and metabolism that affect bodily functions in different ways. The differences provide a roadmap to pursue tailored diagnostics and therapies, researchers said in a study published in Nature Communications. \"There is remarkable variety in terms of developmental and clinical features in people with Down syndrome, and we strongly believe that this diversity is the key to making discoveries that will improve health outcomes and increase life expectancy in this deserving population,\" study leader Dr. Joaquin Espinosa of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus said in a statement. Beware of GLP-1 weight loss drugs sold online Beware of illegitimate websites hawking doses of blockbuster GLP-1 weight loss drugs without a prescription, researchers said after trying to order some of these medications from sources online. They ordered semaglutide – the main prescription-only ingredient in Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy and its diabetes drug Ozempic – from six online vendors. Three websites were selling injection pens, and three were selling vials of freeze-dried semaglutide to be reconstituted into a solution for injection. Prices for the smallest dose and quantity ranged from US $113 to $360. Only three products were received. In the other cases, the vendors requested extra payments ranging from US $650-$1,200 to purportedly clear customs, according to a study published in JAMA Network Open. Quality testing showed semaglutide in all three samples, but with lower purity levels (7%-14% vs advertised 99%) and with doses that significantly exceeded the amount listed on the labels. One sample was possibly contaminated with microorganisms. While they only tested products from three online vendors, all three vendors shipped unregistered and falsified products, the researchers said. \"U.S. poison centers have reported a 1,500% increase in calls related to semaglutide, highlighting the need for enhanced pharmacovigilance including for online sourcing harms,\" they wrote.",

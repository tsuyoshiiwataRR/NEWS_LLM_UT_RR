Police searched his car and found 4.7 grams of blue powder that tested positive for fentanyl, about 800-900 pills, which also tested positive for fentanyl, various other pills and a loaded handgun. They also searched Avdiu’s house where they found two rifles, numerous loaded magazines, a money counter and $7,210.50 cash. Avdiu is being charged with attempted murder and reckless endangerment from the Aug. 5 shooting. He is also being charged with felony drug possession, evading arrest and gun possession during the commission of a felony from Wednesday’s events. He is jailed on $385,000 bond.

    "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) - During their annual retreat Thursday, the FAMU Board of Trustees tackled the controversial $237 million donation attempt earlier this year.\nTheir discussion Thursday of the donation comes after a report, released on Monday, found the donation fraudulent . The report also found that trust in leadership, pressure to seal the deal, and a lack of thorough inspection, led to the acceptance of the donation.\nMichael McLaughlin with the Buchanan Ingersoll and Rooney Firm led the discussion Thursday by laying out his firm’s findings. McLaughlin said none of the university members broke any laws or acted in bad faith regarding accepting the donation.\nMore Tallahassee News:\nHowever, McLaughlin said and agreed that poor decision-making, absent policies, and a lack of understanding of how private stocks work were serious factors that led to the “fraudulent” donation being accepted.\n“I think it’s both a lack of policy as it relates to this specific type of gift being private stock and also a failure to use common sense in the sense that there are experts that are on both this board and the Board of Directors for the Foundation whose expertise could’ve been relied upon,” McLaughlin said.\nBOT Chair Kristin Harper stated that she wants to make sure this situation does not jeopardize the university in receiving future donations.\n“There are proper measures that are put in place so that we don’t compromise FAMU’s ability to receive and solicit legitimate gifts by donors,” Harper said. “I want to make sure that we are balancing our fiduciary responsibilities with the law and with donor confidentiality.”\nTo assist the board in preventing the situation from happening again, McLaughlin laid out some corrective actions for them to enforce moving forward. Those actions included implementing checks and balances for roles overseeing donation-related activity as well as introducing a new policy and full transparency from the university to the board in relation to any financial matters.\nIn May, former President Dr. Larry Robinson announced the school was putting a “pause” on the historic donation pending information that was brought to his attention. That additional information led to the Board passing a motion to form an “internal, multidisciplinary committee” to audit the university’s process for evaluating major gifts.\nThe board plans to discuss solutions and implement those corrective actions in their meeting next month.\nTo stay up to date on all the latest news as it develops, follow WCTV on Facebook and X ( Twitter ).\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction?

    "text": "Driver positive for THC, cocaine found guilty in Collier County head-on DUI crash Jason Mario Orlando was found guilty of driving under the influence and causing serious bodily injury after a three-day trial in Collier County that ended Thursday. On Jan. 7, 2021, around 6:30 a.m., Orlando was driving north on County Road 850 when he veered into the southbound lane. His car crashed head-on with another vehicle and then hit a third car, causing a three-car crash. The driver of the second vehicle checked on Orlando, who was slumped against the steering wheel. Orlando asked for help to get away, admitting he was drunk. Florida Highway Patrol responded to the scene and found open beer cans in Orlando's car, including one between the driver’s door and seat, several behind the driver’s seat, and others on the front passenger floorboard. The driver of the first car suffered significant injuries and identified Orlando as the driver who hit them. Orlando's blood alcohol level was 0.195, and he also had THC and cocaine in his system. Everyone involved in the crash was taken to the hospital. A trooper interviewed Orlando at the hospital and noted the smell of alcohol. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 9, 2024.",

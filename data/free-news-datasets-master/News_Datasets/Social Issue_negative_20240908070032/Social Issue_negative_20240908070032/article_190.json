No violence was reported.\nBulgaria’s parliament on Wednesday approved the amendment to the country’s\neducation legislation, introduced by the pro-Russian Vazrazhdane party and surprisingly, backed by some pro-European Union parties. The lawmakers in the 240-seat parliament voted 159 in favor of the change.\nThe amendment bans the “promotion, popularization and support of ideas and opinions related to non-traditional sexual orientation or sexual identification other than biological” in schools.\nIn a separate vote Wednesday, lawmakers also approved a law defining “non-traditional sexual orientation” as one that is “different from the generally accepted and established notions in Bulgarian legal tradition of emotional, romantic, sexual or sensual attraction between persons of the opposite sex”.\nEuropean Union member Bulgaria has been criticized for\nviolating the rights of the LGBTQ+ community and has been urged to guarantee its recognition and protection. Bulgaria has also declined to ratify the Istanbul Convention on preventing violence against women, because of widespread belief it means to promote LGBTQ+ rights.\nEuropean rights groups, like the Belgium-based Forbidden Colors, condemned the legislation as an assault on the fundamental rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly children.\n“It is deeply troubling to see Bulgaria adopting tactics from Russia’s anti-human rights playbook. Such actions are not only regressive but are also in direct contradiction to the values of equality and non-discrimination that the European Union stands for,” Forbidden Colors said in a statement on its website.\nSimilar anti-LGBTQ+ legislation has been passed in\nother countries in the region, including Hungary, Bosnia, Moldova and Turkey.",

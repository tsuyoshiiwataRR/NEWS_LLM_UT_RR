Lululemon Athletica Inc., et al., Case No. 1:24-cv-06033, on behalf of persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Lululemon Athletica Inc. (“Lululemon&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; or the “Company&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;) (NASDAQ: LULU ) securities between December 7, 2023 and July 24, 2024 , inclusive (the “Class Period&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;). Plaintiff pursues claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;).\nInvestors are hereby notified that they have 60 days from the date of this notice to move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff in this action.\nIf you suffered a loss on your Lululemon investments or would like to inquire about potentially pursuing claims to recover your loss under the federal securities laws, you can submit your contact information at www.glancylaw.com/cases/Lululemon-Athletica-Inc/ .

Specifically, net revenue in the Americas grew 9% in the quarter and 12% in the fiscal year 2023, short of the 29% growth in the year-ago period and 12% growth in the previous quarter. On this news, the Company&CloseCurlyQuote;s share price fell $75.65, or 15.80%, to close at $403.19 per share on March 22, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.\nThen, on July 24, 2024, Bloomberg reported that several analysts posited Lululemon&CloseCurlyQuote;s inventory allocation seemed inconsistent, particularly as to the Breezethrough legging launched earlier that month, both in-store and online. On this news, the Company&CloseCurlyQuote;s stock price fell $9.31, or 3.3%, to close at $272.06 per share on July 24, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.\nThen, on July 25, 2024, before the market opened, Bloomberg reported that a Lululemon spokesperson told the agency that the Company “made the decision to pause on sales [of the Breezethrough yoga wear] for now to make any adjustments necessary to deliver the best possible product experience.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; On this news, the Company&CloseCurlyQuote;s share price fell $24.74, or 9.09%, to close at $247.32 per share on July 25, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.\nThe complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company&CloseCurlyQuote;s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the Company was struggling with inventory allocation issues and color palette execution issues; (2) that, as a result, the Company&CloseCurlyQuote;s Breezethrough product launch underperformed; (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company was experiencing stagnating sales in the Americas region; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants&CloseCurlyQuote; positive statements about the Company&CloseCurlyQuote;s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn , Twitter , or Facebook .\nIf you purchased or otherwise acquired Lululemon securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than 60 days from the date of this notice to ask the Court to appoint you as lead plaintiff.

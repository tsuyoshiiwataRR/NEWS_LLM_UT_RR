    "text": "08 Aug 2024 | 08:20 PM UTC India: Political party to protest across Tamil Nadu State Aug. 14 MDMK party to rally at district headquarters in Tamil Nadu State, India, Aug. 14. Increased security, disruptions likely. The Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) party will stage rallies across Tamil Nadu State on Aug. 14. The action is to denounce the alleged lack of sufficient inclusion of state affairs in the annual national budget. Activists will gather at various district headquarters or administrative centers within each district. Well-attended gatherings could attract thousands of participants. Authorities will likely monitor any such gatherings and could use force to disperse overly unruly crowds. Isolated clashes between police and activists cannot be ruled out. Associated localized transport and business disruptions are likely. As a precaution avoid any demonstration that materializes. Depart the area at the first sign of any security disturbance. Plan accordingly for potential localized transport and business disruptions. Heed all official transport and security advisories.",

    "text": "While fans often hope group separations, hiatuses, and disbandments will happen peacefully without drama, this is not always true. Recently, many were left confused by PENTAGON members‚Äô admissions about each other.\nBlocking And Ghosting? Fans Wonder About Relationship Between Allegedly Estranged PENTAGON Members\nA girl group was recently hinted to have disbanded because of internal discord.\nIn August 2021, Hi-L debuted under SW Entertainment as a six-membered group.\nHi-L | SW Entertainment The group only made one comeback before issues seemingly arose. Member Soojung revealed that she left the group in January 2023, with the group eventually going completely silent on social media.\nNear the end of 2023, the group‚Äôs Instagram was deleted, signaling a possible silent disbandment.\nHowever, in March 2024, Hi-L‚Äôs social media accounts were rebranded to New-L, seemingly signaling a new start. Unlike other groups have been renamed before a new debut, New-L was actually an entirely new group, made up of different members.\nOn August 7, the changed Instagram account began uploading images of the new members, with a message that their debut would happen in September 2024.\nOn this same day, the New-L X account seemingly addressed the changes in a tweet, saying that due to the discord between Hi-L, they (assumed to be the company‚Äôs CEO) would be attempting to debut a new group.\nDear fans, I have worked hard so far, but I am so exhausted from the discord among the members and the things that should not be done as a K-pop singer, so I have decided to give a chance to a new team. I pray that your love will be conveyed to the new girl group New L\nThank you\n‚Äî New-L (Îâ¥Ïóò) (@New_L_official) August 7, 2024\nMany fans demanded answers, with some finding the explanation to be fishy.\nfans deserve an explanation after dedicating years to hi-l. don‚Äôt just drop them for smth new and pretend they didn‚Äôt exist https://t.co/VieFST0BNx\n‚Äî saturn (@jjunlver) August 7, 2024\nNo! You silently disbanded your own group that YOU work hard on and we fans have immense love to. We know in a year or so you‚Äôll disband this group too and crush the dreams of so many girls who have wanted to be a K-pop idol https://t.co/aB4DQDoIV8\n‚Äî sushi ü©∑üèπ (@ELECTRICHE4RTS) August 7, 2024\nYou treat every group you ever have like crap, change your companies name and move on. Giving fans updates on Hi-L or leave the damn industry. Weirdo https://t.co/o1OipUOAiX\n‚Äî DizZzy (@DizZzyS) August 7, 2024\nThe members of Hi-L seemingly reacted to this post in an unexpected way, with several posting photos of them together during their time as a group on their social media accounts. Many interpreted this as their way of speaking out and proving these claims wrong.\nü™¥240808 Dakyung na instagram story #Hi_L #ÌïòÏù¥Ïóò pic.twitter.com/qTZHq4miK4\n‚Äî Hi-L Updates Poland (slow) (@Hi_L_POLAND) August 8, 2024\nSo have leejin and yeseul! This really does seem like it‚Äôs related to the ‚Äústatement‚Äù the new-l acc made https://t.co/aJheNbC9Tb pic.twitter.com/HWfoxra9UR\n‚Äî stand by hi-l (@HiLfeed) August 7, 2024\nSW Entertainment has not released any other information about Hi-L at this time.",

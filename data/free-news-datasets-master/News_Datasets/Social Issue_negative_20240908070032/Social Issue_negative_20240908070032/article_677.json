    "text": "T here are plenty of advantages to playing with Caitlin Clark , but it's no secret that being her teammate also comes with challenges . For example, coach Christie Sides wanted to bring some fun to practice by putting on a home run derby , but Clark took her win as a chance to get under her teammates' skin .\nWatch Caitlin Clark get in teammate's face She didn't just stop at her \"hold the L\" gesture , or her \"bye bye\" and \"goodnight\" taunts . When the Indiana Fever posted the footage on social media, she continued lording it over them, writing the cocky comment: \"been waiting to see these highlights all day.\"\nThe reactions of the fans on social media mirrored the thoughts of her teammates like Aliyah Boston and Lexie Hull .\n\"AB and CC just need their own reality show,\" said one comment on Instagram , while another wrote \"I hate her (she is my favorite person on earth).\"\n\"CC is so competitive lmao,\" a third fan recognized, for better or for worse.\nIt's hard to play with Caitlin Clark Practicing with Clark has its ups and downs, and they show up during WNBA games as well. The No. 1 overall pick leads the league by dishing out 8.2 assists per game . She is also responsible for a league-leading 5.6 turnovers per game .\nHer competitive nature and intense demands of her teammates are reminiscent of Kobe Bryant's Mamba Mentality , which can be difficult on the other members of the squad. Fans took note when Clark's bestie and Iowa roommate Kate Martin overlooked her when naming the best leaders she had played with .\nBoston will probably feel the same after taking the brunt of the trash talk during Clark's home run derby exhibition . The rest of the league is on notice about the rookie's return to WNBA action after the Olympic break , and Fever teammates like Boston are also probably ready to be catching lobs from Clark in game action instead of catching more Ls.",

His publisher says its bored by the backlash A Belgian publisher has apologized but refuses to take down a column that has been accused of inciting antisemitic hatred. In the column, a writer lamented the humanitarian suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and said it made him want to ram a sharp knife through the throat of every Jew I meet, and later defended his words as being protected under free speech. Herman Brusselmans, who is known for being controversial, recently wrote a column for Humo, a weekly Dutch-language magazine which, according to its publisher DPG Media Group, provides in-depth background pieces to the news of the day while doubling as a guide to arts and culture. In his column on Sunday, headlined: The Middle East will explode, a Third World War is coming, Brusselmans described the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a short, fat, bald Jew who for whatever reason wants to ensure that the entire Arab world is wiped out. He continued: For every Hamas or Hezbollah fighter killed by that sh*tty Israeli army, hundreds of innocent civilians are killed, and we cant help but keep repeating that many of those are children, and that we here in the so-called safe West cannot imagine that the same fate would befall our children. https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/08/europe/belgian-columnist-antisemitism-accusations-intl-scli/index.html Just remember \"it's not antisemitic\" Info View thread info, including edit history Trash Put this thread in your Trash Can (My DU » Trash Can) Bookmark Add this thread to your Bookmarks (My DU » Bookmarks) 0 replies, 77 views Share Get links to this post and/or share on social media Alert Alert this post for a rule violation Powers There are no powers you can use on this post Edit Cannot edit other people's posts Reply Reply to this post Edit Cannot edit other people's posts Rec (1) Reply Reply to this post Reply to this discussion https://pmatep5f7b.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ProdStage Latest Discussions » General Discussion » A columnist wrote Gaza ma...

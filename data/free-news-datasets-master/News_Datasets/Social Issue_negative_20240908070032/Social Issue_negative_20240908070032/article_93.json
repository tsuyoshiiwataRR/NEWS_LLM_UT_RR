    "text": "AMROHA: An additional district and sessions judge sentenced a man to life imprisonment and two others, including a woman, to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment under SC/ ST Act for their involvement in kidnapping and gang rape of a Dalit girl in 2016 in a village in UP’s Amroha Dehat. The court also imposed a collective fine of Rs 1.2 lakh on the three convicts. The incident took place on July 10, 2016, when the main convict, accompanied by a neighbour, visited the survivor’s house. When the survivor, then 19 years old, opened the door, the convicts gagged her and forced her into a car where two men were present.The convicts then drove the girl to a sugarcane field . The following morning, a woman living near the sugarcane field, took the survivor to her house and held her hostage. The convicts then raped her again. The woman arranged for the suvivor to be sold to a man from Punjab for Rs 3 lakh.Special public prosecutor Manoj Kumar Saxena said the survivor was scheduled to be sent with the man from Punjab on July 12. However, under pressure from the convict’s family, he brought her back from the woman’s house.Despite the survivor’s police complaint, no action was taken initially. Only when SP intervened, a case was registered against five accused. They were subsequently arrested and jailed but were released on bail in 2017.",

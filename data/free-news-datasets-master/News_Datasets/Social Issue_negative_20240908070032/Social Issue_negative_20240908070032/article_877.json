    "text": "Jack Olson, a longtime fundraiser for police organizations, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of tax evasion in federal court in Lincoln on Thursday. Sentencing will be Nov. 5. The 67-year-old from Council Bluffs was indicted in April 2023 alongside former Omaha Police Department Officers Richard Gonzalez and Johnny Palermo in relation to fraudulent fundraising activities for the Latino Peace Officers Association (LPOA). Olson initially faced eight felony charges: Wire fraud conspiracy, three counts of wire fraud and four counts of tax evasion. He will be sentenced to no more than 42 months in prison as part of the plea agreement. Under the plea agreement, Olson will also pay restitution of $27,111.25 to the LPOA and up to $30,883.33 to individual donors. The restitution amounts will be decided at sentencing. Olson would also pay $95,475 to the U.S. Department of Treasury. People are also reading… While both the state and Olson have agreed to the plea agreement, it will have to be approved by Olson’s sentencing judge. Olson can back out of his guilty plea if the judge does not agree to sentence him to no more than 42 months in prison. Under the plea agreement, Olson admitted he conspired with Gonzalez and Palermo between 2017 and April 2023 to defraud LPOA of money. Olson would solicit donations on behalf of LPOA and would keep approximately 65%-80% of the money, according to the plea agreement. The organization’s website stated that 100% of donations went to athletic programs for children, but the LPOA was not organizing and administering any athletic programs for children in Omaha at the time, according to the agreement. Olson spent a significant amount of the funds on personal expenses, the agreement said, and he was primarily paid via cash withdrawal from LPOA’s bank account or via cashier’s check. He deposited checks at the police credit union and received a percentage based on his contract with LPOA, according to the plea agreement. Olson did not file income tax returns from 2018 through 2021, resulting in an estimated tax loss of $95,705. Gonzalez and Palermo both pled guilty to wire fraud conspiracy in connection with the scheme and were sentenced to prison. Gonzalez was sentenced to 18 months and Palermo 24 months . Olson’s case is adjacent, though not directly related, to the prosecution of former Omaha City Councilman Vinny Palermo. Two grand jury indictments were handed down on the same day in April — one naming Gonzalez, Johnny Palermo and Olson; the other naming Gonzalez, Johnny Palermo and Vinny Palermo. Vinny Palermo and Johnny Palermo are not related. What you missed last week in notable Omaha crimes and court cases Last week's local crime and court updates from The World-Herald. The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s ruling to dismiss defamation and other claims for a Catholic priest accused of sexual misconduct against the Archdiocese of Omaha on Friday. A new lawsuit filed in Missouri accuses Omaha Archbishop George Lucas of sexually abusing a teen-aged seminarian in St. Louis in the late 1980s, an allegation that Lucas denies. Omaha's new $27 million juvenile detention center sits empty nearly a year after the controversial project's completition. From the Flatwater Free Press An Omaha man was sentenced on Wednesday to 16 months in federal prison for speeding past security at Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue and driving around the base with a gun in his vehicle in 2022. Multiple residents of a midtown Omaha apartment building were forced to evacuate after a fire broke out early Tuesday morning. An Omaha man pleaded no contest and was found guilty of felony motor vehicle homicide last week in connection with a crash that ejected and killed a passenger in his truck as he attempted to flee from a traffic stop. An Omaha man fatally shot another man near Carter Lake in May before setting fire to the stolen car used in the shooting, according to testimony Monday from an Omaha police detective.",

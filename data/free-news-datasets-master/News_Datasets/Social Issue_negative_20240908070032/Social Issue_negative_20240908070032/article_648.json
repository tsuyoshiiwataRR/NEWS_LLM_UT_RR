    "text": "A former University of Colorado Boulder student was found guilty of sexually assaulting a woman on Kittredge Field in September of 2022.\nBrennan Pieper, 21, was convicted Monday by a jury of two counts of sexual assault and unlawful sexual conduct.He is set for sentencing on Oct. 4.“We are grateful to the jury for coming to his verdict and holding the defendant accountable for his actions on Sept. 26, 2022,” Deputy District Attorneys Taylor Suta and Nevene Hullender said in a joint statement. “The victim showed tremendous courage throughout this entire process — from reporting to police, to testifying at trial almost two years later. However, this outcome would not have happened without the tremendous work done by the CU Police Department and the lead detective, Marc Mustoe. It is because of their diligent investigation and the victim’s testimony that we were able to achieve justice in this case.”According to an affidavit, the sexual assault investigation began when a CU Boulder police officer took the initial report on Sept. 28, 2022.The woman who reported the sexual assault told police that she and Brennan Pieper were kissing in a dorm on CU campus at night when he suggested going out to Kittredge Field.She stated that Pieper led the woman to a dark corner of the field near a shed and then held the woman down and forced oral and digital penetration. The women told police that the incident on the field was not consensual and that she told Pieper “no” several times.In an interview with police, Pieper denied being out on the Kittredge fields at all. However, when officers showed him surveillance camera footage of the woman and him going out to the fields, Pieper said, he and the woman only kissed.According to the affidavit, “Pieper further changed his story” and then said the woman initiated the sexual contact.On December 1, 2022, a warrant was signed for Pieper’s arrest, according to court records. Pieper was arrested on Dec. 2, 2022 and was later released on a $25,000 personal recognizance bond.“We appreciate the jury’s service,” said District Attorney Michael Dougherty. “These guilty verdicts are the right outcome and a direct result of the victim’s strength, the outstanding investigation by the CU Police Department, and the hard work of our team.”",

    "text": "Louisville man arrested after police locate stolen vehicle in Grayson County LEITCHFIELD, Ky. (WBKO) - On Wednesday, Aug. 7, deputies with the Grayson County Sheriff’s Office received a call from dispatch stating that a female citizen had located her uncle’s stolen truck at the Smitty City convenience store located at KY 259/KY 226 intersection. According to the official press release, the female advised that a male subject was in the vehicle. Some other citizens had blocked the vehicle from leaving the premises. When deputies arrived, they discovered 41-year-old Aaron Miller of Louisville was driving the vehicle and admitted to stealing it from the victim. Close to where the victim’s truck was stolen, was a maroon 2007 Dodge Charger that was abandoned near the Clarkson exit on the Western Kentucky Parkway. It was later discovered that Miller had stolen that vehicle from Jeffersonville, IN. He drove the vehicle until it ran out of gas and it was then that he looked for another vehicle to steal. He was arrested and lodged in the Grayson County Detention Center for two counts of theft by unlawful taking (auto). Miller also had an active bench warrant out of Jefferson County for a failure to appear. Both vehicles were returned to their rightful owners. Copyright 2024 WBKO. All rights reserved.",

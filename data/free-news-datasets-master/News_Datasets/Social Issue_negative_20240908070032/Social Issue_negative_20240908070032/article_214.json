    "text": "Four Corners ‘ long-awaited investigation into Channel Seven will screen next Monday night.\n“Don’t Speak”, reported by Louise Milligan, hears from former staff and those formerly linked to the network including Amber Harrison, Mark Gibson and more.\nChannel Seven bills itself as a family network, but a Four Corners investigation finds it to be a “second chance club” for senior men, described as a “degrading, soul-crushing” workplace.\nAllegations of sexism, exploitation and extreme bullying at the network are rife and staff have been left hospitalised. In some extreme cases, they are unable to work or been suicidal.\nMany staff have made legal claims against the network and many past staff have been gagged with non-disclosure agreements.\nReporter Louise Milligan and the Four Corners team have spoken to more than 200 people for this explosive story, including current staff who told them they believe there is a desperate need for change at both Seven and the broader commercial television industry.\nMonday 12 August at 8:30pm on ABC.",

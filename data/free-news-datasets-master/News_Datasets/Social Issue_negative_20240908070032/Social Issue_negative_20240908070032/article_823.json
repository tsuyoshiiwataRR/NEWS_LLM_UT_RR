    "text": "Butte-Silver Bow has hired a private security company on an emergency basis to patrol the Uptown parking garage, saying drinking, fighting and other dangerous activities among mostly juveniles demand immediate action. The problems aren’t new and nothing horrific has happened yet, said county Chief Executive J.P. Gallagher, but the illicit behavior has become so frequent and dangerous of late that security patrols at night are needed. Gallagher asked commissioners for emergency spending authority to hire Timberline Security for at least the next two weeks at the garage, located at 60 W. Park St. The council suspended its rules to consider the request on such short notice Wednesday night then OK’d the arrangement. “We’re having an incredible amount of activity, especially with the summer activities, with young people up there drinking, fighting, walking on the rails, and we’re getting it reported by people who live nearby,” Gallagher told The Montana Standard on Thursday. People are also reading… Vehicle gates at each entrance to the garage are lowered each night at 10 p.m. but that hasn’t stopped the activities, much of them occurring on the open-air top story. “There’s just a lot of really dangerous activity that’s been happening throughout the night,” Gallagher said. “Police have been responding, but by the time they pull up, the people disperse. “We are finding an incredible amount of bottles and glass and we clean it up every single day, but it’s turned into a dangerous situation and we think this is the best preventative measure that makes sense,” he said. Under a contract, Timberline will have a security guard patrolling the garage from 8 p.m. to 3 a.m. every night through at least Aug. 20. Timberline will be paid $33.25 per hour the first week and $29.50 per hour the second week. The total is $3,074.75 for the two weeks. The contract can be extended after that with council approval and Gallagher says he might ask for that. But he hopes a private company can deliver longer-term solutions to parking problems in the garage and elsewhere. Commissioners recently considered a proposal for that but put it on hold when questions arose about proper bidding procedures. They could choose among new proposals soon. County officials committed to building a parking garage as part of a deal that resulted in NorthWestern Energy building a new $25 million Montana headquarters Uptown. The county’s Urban Revitalization Agency used taxpayer dollars to finance construction of the $7.4 million parking garage on West Park Street and it was completed in 2018. Many of NorthWestern’s employees paid for monthly parking permits. But the kiosk system for hourly parkers hasn’t worked well, use of the garage dropped significantly during the COVID pandemic and never rebounded, and other problems have plagued the facility the past few years. They include vagrancy, human feces and urine found in the building, discarded needles and trash, and teens using it as a party place. The county has responded with more patrols by police and parking officers, increased power washes and cleanings and other moves, but some of the problems have persisted. Gallagher still thinks the problems are fixable. “Until that point, we’re probably going to need security in there, especially at night,” he said.",

    "text": "CNN reporter Tom Foreman fact-checked many of the claims made by former President Donald Trump regarding the economy and immigration.\nTrump spoke to reporters at a press conference on Thursday at Mar-a-Lago , where the Republican nominee slammed Kamala Harris’s intelligence, and popularity. Trump also claimed the U.S. economy was headed toward a depression.\nThe former president also claimed that Biden was forced out of the presidency by his fellow Democrats.\nForeman joined a CNN panel following the event to ‘unpack’ many of the false claims made by Trump.\nThere is a lot to unpack in terms of falsehoods. Let’s start with the economy, a big thing for many issues out there. He said we could literally be in the throes of a depression, not a recession. He said close to 1920s depression, 1920s the depression was 25% unemployment. We’re at 4.3% now. Not even close, not even the same ballgame. He also mentioned, weirdly enough, people can’t buy bacon. I checked on bacon sales. They seem to be doing just fine. On the border, as Brianna noted earlier, he grossly overinflated the number of people coming over the border there. He also repeated a claim that he’s made many times before that he really must like, even as the numbers fall here, saying this notion that people are coming out of mental institutions and prisons, as he said, all over the world, are emptying into the United States, he said this many times, never offered any proof about Kamala Harris.\nHe says she’s the most unpopular, worst vice president in history. Couldn’t pass her bar exam. Scholars surveyed by the L.A. Times , ranked VP’s from 1933 on. They put Harris at 11 out of 18. Not great. Certainly not the worst. And she did pass her bar exam, even though she had to do it more than once. He said President Biden had the presidency taken away from him. Not true. That is false. President Biden agreed to leave the presidency. He wasn’t happy about it. Nobody would be. But he agreed to leave. And he backs Harris and her campaign.\nHe said everybody wanted Roe v Wade overturned. The country overwhelmingly wanted this and returned to the States. Not true. Even now, more than two years afterward, a Pew study said that 63% of people still think abortion nationwide should largely be legal, not left up to the states. And one more thing. He talked for quite some time there about how he protected Hillary Clinton and always wanted to keep her safe, but at least more than a half dozen times in recent years, he has said publicly she should go to jail and a whole lot of other Democrats as well.\nWatch the clip above via CNN .\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com",

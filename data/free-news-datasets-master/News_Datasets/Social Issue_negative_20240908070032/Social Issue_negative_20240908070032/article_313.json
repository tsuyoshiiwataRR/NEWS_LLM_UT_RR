    "text": "Why do people like Donald Trump and JD Vance always belittle or denigrate their opponents? Most of you probably already realize the signs of such behavior but here is what I found, and I am not even a psychologist. 1. They are trying to make themselves feel more powerful or important. 2 They have low self-esteem and need to build themselves up by making others feel inferior. 3. They are insecure in relationships. 4. It is a form of narcissism in that they need to belittle, degrade, and insult in order to chip away at your self-confidence. I think you get the picture. I also wonder if this if part of Trump's strategy or just his natural personality. I remember Trump always calling Biden a \"loser\", when in fact Trump lost 62 out of 63 court cases where he challenged the results of the 2020 election. He also has 34 felony convictions. Do we really want someone like this in the White House? God help us. Joseph Malberg People are also readingâ€¦ Marana Disclaimer: As submitted to the Arizona Daily Star.",

    "text": "By Irene Rotondo | IRotondo@masslive.com The owner of a Boston bar where a 23-year-old Marine veteran was killed by a bouncer in 2022 has closed the establishment and is looking to sell its license, the owner’s lawyer announced this week. The proceeds will go to the Marine’s family, he said.\nThe Sons of Boston bar shut down after the fatal stabbing and reopened at 19 Union St. on May 11, 2023, with a new name, Loyal Nine. The previous establishment had been in operation since 2018 , according to a post on its Instagram account.\nBut on Tuesday, attorney Carolyn Conway went before the Boston Licensing Board and said her client has closed the bar and wants to sell their license. Additionally, Conway said the proceeds of that sale will go to the family of 23-year-old Daniel Martinez.\nThough it is unclear which specific license Conway was referencing, the transaction of liquor licenses is common given the state’s cap on the number issued. Liquor licenses can sell for as much as $600,000 in Boston.\nRead more: Family recounts devastation in wake of marine’s murder outside Boston bar Martinez, who was from Chicago, was a recently discharged U.S. Marine Corps veteran and was visiting Boston with friends for St. Patrick’s Day weekend two years ago. He was denied entry to Sons of Boston, and investigators said the bouncer followed Martinez and his friend down the block and then stabbed Martinez in the chest.\nThe bouncer, Alvaro Larrama, 40, of East Boston, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to up to 20 years in prison in April.\nThe Loyal Nine license transaction was not the initial issue before the Licensing Board, which had corresponded with Conway about a separate assault and battery violation at the bar in June. She responded that the bar was now closed. Further information on that incident was not immediately available.\nThe Licensing Board will address the sale of the license at a later date. The owners of Loyal Nine and Conway were not immediately available for comment.\nMore Boston stories Red Sox option Vaughn Grissom, top offseason trade acquisition, to Triple A Boston police ID Jamaica Plain man killed in stabbing on Sunday Red Sox C prospect acquired from Yankees batting .389 at Worcester Petition to put Robin Williams statue at ‘Good Will Hunting’ bench in Public Garden gains steam Former Boston city councilor pleads guilty in 2023 car crash, must apologize to homeowner If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

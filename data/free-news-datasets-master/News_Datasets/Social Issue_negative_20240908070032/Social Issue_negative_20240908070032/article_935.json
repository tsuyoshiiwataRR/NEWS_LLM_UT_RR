    "text": "UGA upholds sanctions for 6 students over Mideast war protest ATHENS, Ga. - Six University of Georgia students arrested during an April 29 protest against the [Israel-Hamas war](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-latest-2-august-2024-4b5d030519f35181cf92d0313cb583d8) will remain suspended through the fall semester, the university said. They’ll also stay on probation for the remainder of their academic careers at the university. The decision came after a 13-hour disciplinary hearing on July 30. Students can appeal. [AU students moving in this week before heading back to school](https://www.wrdw.com/2024/08/07/au-students-moving-this-week-before-heading-back-school/) It’s almost back-to-school time for Augusta University students and for the first semester with the new chief. An attorney representing two of the suspended students, Josh Lingsch, called the hearing “nothing more than a kangaroo court” in a Thursday statement. Campus police arrested 16 protesters who set up an encampment near university President Jere Morehead’s office on the Athens campus in April. The school suspended the students hours later. Some students informally resolved charges with the school by acknowledging their violations, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. [New AARP poll shows Ga. toss-up between Trump, Harris](https://www.wrdw.com/2024/08/08/new-aarp-poll-shows-ga-toss-up-between-trump-harris/) “Georgia voters 50-plus say they would be more likely to vote for candidates who commit to protecting Social Security and supporting family caregivers,” the association said. During the hearing, the six remaining students said they had a right to protest and none of their actions interrupted academic activities. When they tried to comply with orders to move, students [said](https://www.onlineathens.com/story/news/education/campus/2024/08/06/uga-student-panel-upholds-sanctions-imposed-on-6-suspended-students/74690147007/) officers used force and tried to end their protest. The students also expressed anger with Israel’s actions in the Israel-Hamas war and what they say is the university’s support for Israel.

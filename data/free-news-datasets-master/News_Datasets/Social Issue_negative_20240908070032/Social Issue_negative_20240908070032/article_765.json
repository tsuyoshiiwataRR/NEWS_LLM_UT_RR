    "text": "A judge decided Thursday that there was probable cause for a 62-year-old rural Joplin man to stand trial on charges that he tried to run down a neighbor couple on a moped with his car. Judge Joseph Hensley indicated at the conclusion of a preliminary hearing in Jasper County Circuit Court that he would be binding Richard W. Dousa over for trial on two counts of first-degree assault pending a decision on his attorney’s request to lower his bond. Dousa has remained in custody since his arrest for allegedly chasing and trying to hit a moped that Jonathan Plummer and his girlfriend were riding June 14 on Missouri Highway 171. His cash-only bond was set initially at $500,000 and subsequently lowered to $50,000, an amount the defendant has not been able to put up. The Jasper County prosecutor’s office has filed for the court to treat the defendant as a prior and persistent offender and remains opposed to any further bond modification. His neighbor, Jonathan Plummer, testified Thursday that he could hear Dousa raging about something outside Plummer’s trailer home the day in question. As Plummer went to leave the trailer court with his girlfriend, Dousa kept yelling at him, and Plummer acknowledged that he called the defendant a derogatory term in response. Plummer said that moments later, the couple found the defendant chasing them down with his car. “It was clear to me he was trying to run us off the road,” Plummer said. Defense attorney Bob Briggs asked Plummer how close he believed Dousa’s car actually came to hitting them, and Plummer said he came within 4 to 5 feet. In an attempt to shake him, Plummer said, he pulled into the satellite office of the sheriff’s department at Airport Drive. But Dousa chased them through the yard of the office in his car. Jasper County Deputy Matthew Leek, who responded to a call reporting the matter and went to the defendant’s address to speak with him in the aftermath, said Dousa held out his hands as he approached him and said: “Take me to jail.” Leek said Dousa then proceeded to repeat several times that he would kill Plummer and that his neighbors were lucky Leek showed up because he would have shot them both. The prosecutor’s office cited in a court filing Dousa’s prior convictions for aggravated assault in Pennsylvania and assault with a dangerous weapon in Wyoming as its reasons for treating him as a prior and persistent offender.",

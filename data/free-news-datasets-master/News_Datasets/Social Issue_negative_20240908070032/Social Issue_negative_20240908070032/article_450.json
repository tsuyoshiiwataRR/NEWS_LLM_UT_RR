    "text": "Catholic Church in Venezuela renews criticism of the Chavista government Interview: International pressure continues to increase on President Nicolás Maduro following his highly contested reelection. The Catholic Church issued statements July 30 and 31 calling for verification of the results. This marks a return to its critical stance against the Chavista regime, which had softened in recent years, explains political scientist Guillermo Tell Aveledo Coll, a professor at the Metropolitan University of Caracas. La Croix: The bishops of Venezuela published statements on July 30 and 31 requesting the detailed results of the July 28 presidential election, in which Nicolás Maduro claimed victory. What is the current position of the Venezuelan Catholic Church amid this political crisis? Guillermo Tell Aveledo Coll: We are experiencing a very delicate moment in Venezuela. Following the election, the government released results showing Nicolás Maduro as the winner, which has generated strong rejection and many doubts. The bishops' conference reacted by issuing a statement. In it, they returned to their traditional criticism of the government, with a tone that was much harsher compared to the more moderate statements in recent years. The bishops are calling for the verification of detailed results. While they condemn the violence of the protests, they disapprove of the way authorities have responded to the demonstrators. Two authoritative figures in the church, Cardinals Baltazar Porras and Diego Padron, also sent a letter to the bishops' conference with severe reproaches toward the government. Do these declarations indicate a shift in the church's stance toward Nicolás Maduro's government? Relations between the [bishops' conference](https://international.la-croix.com/world/catholic-bishops-urge-participation-in-crucial-venezuelan-election) and the state have seen a sort of thaw in recent years. After Hugo Chavez came to power in 1999, the relationship was marked by great mutual hostility. Chavismo equated the church hierarchy with the old social and economic elites of representative democracy. As Chavismo presented itself as a critique of this system, the church became one of its natural enemies. Chavez, for instance, used symbols of popular religiosity to distinguish the religion of the people from that of the elites he opposed. In turn, the church adopted a very critical stance against Chavismo, defending democracy in line with the church's social doctrine and for ideological reasons. When Chavismo declared itself socialist, even Marxist, the church responded with traditional anti-communist rhetoric. Did any part of the Church support Hugo Chavez? Initially, yes. Several voices within the church supported him, particularly in Jesuit circles. However, as Chavismo became more authoritarian, these voices grew critical and eventually supported political change. Figures like Bishop Mario Moronta of San Cristóbal, who was the most conciliatory with Chavismo within the hierarchy, eventually criticized the regime's authoritarian turn. Similarly, Father Arturo Sosa, the Superior General of the [Jesuits](https://international.la-croix.com/news/world/venezuelan-jesuits-issue-warning/5324) and a Venezuelan historian and political scientist, initially understood the causes behind Chavismo but gradually became more critical. Has this mutual hostility between the church and the regime softened in recent years? Yes, Nicolás Maduro's government sought to align with conservative sectors. For about five years, just before the pandemic, it toned down its most radical rhetoric and tried to improve relations with the church, including by approving bishop appointments. In Venezuela, church-state relations are governed by a concordat, requiring state approval for church appointments. During the early Chavismo years, these approvals were withheld. Further reading: [In Colombia, the impossible vote for Venezuelan exiles](https://international.la-croix.com/world/in-colombia-the-impossible-vote-for-venezuelan-exiles) The warming of relations was also evident with the beatification of Dr. José Gregorio Hernandez (1864-1919), a popular Catholic figure in Venezuela known for aiding the poor and attributed with many miracles. His beatification had stalled, possibly due to the syncretic devotion he inspired. The government lobbied for his beatification, which was declared in 2021. Additionally, while Maduro courted evangelical churches with financial benefits, he has also supported Catholic parishes to win over local priests. Why did the church soften its criticisms against the government in the same period? The church maintained its general social and political criticisms but refrained from explicitly condemning the government. It called for conciliation and strengthened its role as a mediator, influenced by the context of repression and societal control by the regime. In some ways, Chavismo's authoritarianism worked: the opposition couldn't propose a real alternative, leading sectors of society, like the traditional bourgeoisie, to adopt a cautious stance. The church also followed this trend. However, with recent elections, the church has resumed a critical stance. Does the church's voice still hold weight in Venezuela? Yes, Catholics are the majority in Venezuela. Traditionally moderate, the church rarely addresses issues of sexual morality, gender, or spiritual matters, focusing instead on inequality and poverty. Without direct power, the church holds significant moral authority, and its statements are always anticipated. Cardinal Baltazar Porras, for instance, the Archbishop Emeritus of Caracas and a member of the National Academy of History of Venezuela, is a prominent intellectual figure. Though not a conservative, he has consistently criticized Maduro's regime. It is also important to note that religious freedom is not threatened in Venezuela.",

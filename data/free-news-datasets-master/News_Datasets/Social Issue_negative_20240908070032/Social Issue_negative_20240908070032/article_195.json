    "text": "BOISE, Idaho — Multiple sheriff's offices are sounding the alarm and warning the public after receiving reports of recent phone scams. The Bonneville County Sheriff's Office and the Elmore Sheriff's Office said scammers are faking their numbers to mimic the sheriff's office's number. They are posing as a deputy or officer by using their names and demanding money to cover a fake warrant or court date fee. \"The suspects offer up enough accurate information about our area and portray themselves in a convincing way to make the would-be victim believe they will be arrested if they fail to act or return their call,\" Bonneville sheriff's said. Scammers then create a fake sense of urgency and demand gift cards as payments. [Gift cards](/article/news/local/ftc-joins-idaho-agencies-share-stories-behind-rising-consumer-scams/277-670b106b-3303-47a4-acfd-a7788e97f58c) are a common way scammers steal money from their victims, as once they are redeemed, the money cannot be recovered. The Bonneville Sheriff's said if you believe a scammer is calling you, you should hang up immediately and call law enforcement. Also, if you have been the victim of a scam, call them immediately. In Elmore County, the sheriff's office said if a scammer has contacted you, call them immediately, as your tip can help their investigation. \"If you believe you are being scammed in some manner, it’s always a good idea to monitor your financial accounts, update passwords, and enable security verifications for your online accounts to make sure your information is as safe as possible,\" Bonneville sheriff's said.",

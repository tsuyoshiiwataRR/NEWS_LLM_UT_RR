    "text": "Three members of the Miller family were charged and arrested over a racially charged incident that went viral on TikTok. The family at the center of an incident in Virginia City that has been widely condemned as racist have roots that extend outside of the community where they earned notoriety. The Millers — Gary Miller, Janis Miller and Tiffany Miller — were charged and arrested on Wednesday following an altercation with a Black man during the Hot August Nights kickoff event at Virginia City on Aug. 2. The family posted bail on Wednesday evening, according to the Storey County Sheriff's Department. In a video that went viral on TikTok, Ricky Johnson can be seen confronting the Millers over comments Gary Miller made while Johnson was seeking signatures for a voter petition to cap attorney’s fees in Nevada. “He just said there’s a hanging tree down there to hang people like me,” Johnson said in the video, which received more than a million views before Johnson took it down over community guidelines. The incident has since been condemned by multiple parties who spoke out against racism, including Virginia City, Hot August Nights, Gov. Joe Lombardo and Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford. Several event attendees in the video have also been permanently banned by Hot August Nights . Here is what we know about the Miller family based on public records. The Millers own property in Virginia City Husband and wife Gary and Janis Miller are listed as the owners of 171 S. C Street and 161 S. C Street in Virginia City, according to Storey County Assessor records. The adjoined properties comprise one whole parcel and are currently occupied by the Firehouse Grill Saloon & Grill, which is renting the space from the Millers. The couple bought the property for $2.3 million on March 1 of this year. The Firehouse Grill Saloon & Grill initially welcomed the Millers as landlords, posting on Facebook in April about a party it held for the couple. Following the incident, however, the business disavowed any connection with them, referring to Janis Miller as “the lady in the video wearing a Tshirt that we sell in our bar.” “We absolutely support Everyone, we do not discriminate in any way,” the Firehouse Saloon posted on Facebook in response to the incident before taking the page down. The Millers reside in Minden and moved to the area from California While the Millers have been associated with Virginia City after the viral incident, the couple’s official residence is in a town 30 miles away. Tax records for their Virginia City property list a Minden address as the couple’s official residence, which is in Douglas County. Records from the Nevada Secretary of State’s office also list Gary Miller as the managing member of a limited liability company or LLC based in Minden. Prior to moving to Minden, the Millers also lived in the Bay Area. While living in California, Janis Miller worked as a Catholic school teacher at Grace School and Our Lady of Grace Church in Castro Valley and the Catholic Diocese of Oakland, according to public records. What were the Millers charged and arrested for? The Millers were charged and arrested following an investigation by the Storey County Sheriff’s Office. Gary Miller, who turns 75 this month, was charged with breach of peace, a gross misdemeanor. Janis Miller, 67, who could be seen touching Johnson multiple times in the video, was charged with battery, which is a misdemeanor. Daughter Tiffany Miller, 45, was also charged with a misdemeanor for obstructing and delaying a peace officer.",

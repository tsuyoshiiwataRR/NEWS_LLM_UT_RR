    "text": "We are facing yet another [summer COVID surge](https://fortune.com/well/article/covid-summer-surge-2024-symptoms-treatment-isolation-guidelines/). Infection rates are [ rising ](https://fortune.com/well/article/covid-summer-surge-2024-symptoms-treatment-isolation-guidelines/)across 84 countries, according to the World Health Organization. And amid an [ invigorating Olympics games](https://fortune.com/well/article/simone-biles-mindset-mental-training/), even the most elite of us have proven they are not immune. After winning bronze in the 200-meter finals Thursday, American sprinter Noah Lyles confirmed he tested positive for COVID two days prior. He’s among dozens of other athletes who have tested positive during the Games. He told NBC that he had not disclosed his diagnosis to his teammates. “We were trying to keep this as close to the chest as possible,” Lyles, wearing a mask, [told journalists ](https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/live-blog/olympic-games-2024-live-updates-rcna162873)following the race. “You never want to tell your competitors you’re sick. Why would you give them an edge over you?” According to NBC, Lyles confided in his coach, medical staff, and family, and made the decision to stay in the race because it was his “one shot.” What are COVID protocols at the 2024 Paris Olympics? Unlike the strict protocols of the 2020 Tokyo [Olympics](https://fortune.com/company/olympic-steel/), COVID guidelines in Paris are much more relaxed, leaving the decision of whether or not to compete with the virus up to the athletes and their staff. “I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go. I didn’t have any time to save energy, so that was kind of the strategy for today,” Lyles told reporters at the Games. “This is by far the best day I felt out of the last three days. I still wouldn’t say I’m 100% but I would definitely say I’m closer to like, 90 to 95%.” For many, this move feels like quite the head-turner after years of intense COVID precautions. Some have taken their opinions online, criticizing the sprinter for competing with the highly contagious illness. One person asks what many are thinking: “ [You are allowed to compete if you have covid?](https://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/1ene3y5/noah_lyles_has_covid_according_to_nbc/)” An epidemiologist commented on No matter the illness severity, COVID is still highly contagious, experts have previously told Fortune. Olympians with underlying conditions, including Lyles, who has asthma, may be at an increased risk for complications from COVID. And even athletes with mild cases of COVID may have reduced performance. After Lyles completed his race, he fell to the ground and was led off the track in a wheelchair. Lyles has described his COVID [ symptoms ](https://fortune.com/well/article/covid-summer-surge-2024-symptoms-treatment-isolation-guidelines/)as minor, saying he felt “quite lightheaded after that race, and shortness of breath and chest pain was definitely active … But after a while, I was able to catch my breath and get my wits about me. So I’m feeling a lot better now.” The USA Track & Field organization issued a statement regarding Lyles’ diagnosis: “In response, the USOPC [U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee] and USATF swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors.” It continues: “Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete … After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.” It’s yet to be determined if Lyles will compete in the 4x100m relay this weekend, which would be his last event of the Games. Fans and COVID risk An official statement regarding public health protocol from the 2024 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games, the World Health Organization, the French Ministry of Health and Prevention, the Santé publique France and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control acknowledges that attending mass sporting events “increases your chances of being exposed to respiratory diseases, including whooping cough and COVID-19.” The guidance recommends staying up-to-date on vaccinations and staying home, or wearing a mask if you feel any symptoms of respiratory illnesses, like a fever or cough.

    "text": "Environmentalists have labelled Hydro Tasmania's $1.6 billion plan to refurbish its ageing dams over the next decade as a continuation of \"unnecessary industrialisation\" of the state. Lake Pedder Restoration Committee convenor Christine Milne said with developments in new energy technologies like wind and solar, Tasmanians should be consulted before the government spends billions on upgrading century-old dams and power stations. Her comments came after Hydro Tasmania chief executive Ian Brooksbank unveiled the company's 10-year investment plan on Thursday morning. With many of Tasmania's dams now approaching the end of their lives, the company is embarking on a program to boost output and reliability by refurbishing some of assets over the next decade. Hydro is planning to spend $1.6 billion upgrading 11 power stations and 5 dams across the state by 2035. But the government should instead consult with Tasmanians before enacting the plan, activists say. \"Instead of spending $1.6 billion on automatically patching up dams and power stations, there is an opportunity for Tasmanians to be asked what they want to spend money on,\" Ms Milne said. The Hydro plan includes ongoing work to overhaul the Tarraleah scheme in the Central Highlands, which will enable the station to provide more flexible 'firming' power capabilities instead of providing only baseload generation. The revamp will also add another 80 megawatts of generation capacity to the Tarraleah scheme. Energy Minister Nick Duigan said the plan would enable economic expansion in the state and secure its position as a major renewable energy producer. \"With Tasmanian energy consumption predicted to continue to grow, we can't afford to reduce our hydro generator fleet,\" he said. \"This 10-year investment will ensure that Tasmanian's Hydro generation continues to drive the state's economy and jobs into the future.\" Restore Pedder Campaign coordinator Maddie McShane said the government's \"obsession with unsustainable growth\" was driving the state towards destruction. \"The government should be investing in nature, not unnecessary industrialisation\", she said. Tasmania could unlock \"significant\" benefits for people and biodiversity by decommissioning ageing Edgar and Scotts Peak dams instead of investing to restore them, she said. Restore Pedder claimed that demand for electricity from residential and small business customers declined during 2022-2023, while about half of all power in the state went to \"four old declining heavy industries\". \"Just one of those old industries falling over releases a huge amount of energy to meet any additional Tasmanian demand,\" she said. The government has faced criticism over the past year regarding the low level of surplus generating capacity available for industrial consumers in the state. Labor leader Dean Winter has previously said Hydro rejected a request for an additional 50MW of capacity by Australian Newsprint Mills for a project that would have cut and used electricity in its boiler process. The Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said the lack of available power in the state is deterring investors. The government has admitted that demand and supply of electricity is \"balanced\" in the state. DAILY Today's top stories curated by our news team. Also includes evening update.",

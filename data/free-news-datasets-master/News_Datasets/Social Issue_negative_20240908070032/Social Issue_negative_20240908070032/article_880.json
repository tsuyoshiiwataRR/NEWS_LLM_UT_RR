    "text": "The number of Democrats dropped by 270 more than Republicans in July in Washoe County. The number of Washoe County registered voters plunged by about 6,800 in July, largely due to efforts to clean up voter rolls. On July 1, Washoe County reported 330,685 active registered voters. By Aug. 1, the number had dropped 2% to 323,902, according to the Registrar of Voters’ office. This was largely attributed to 25,000 notification cards sent to registered voters whose primary ballots in June were returned as undeliverable, county elections spokesperson George Guthrie told the Reno Gazette Journal. “Our office had a lot of fresh information to act on,” Guthrie said. “The drop in active registrants is due to us taking action to inactivate those who did not follow up with us a month after we sent them a postcard.” Monday was the deadline to return those postcards. Those voters are still eligible to vote, but they will not automatically receive a mail ballot for the general election in November. They could be removed entirely if they don't vote in two consecutive general elections. \"If a voter received a postcard and did not follow up with our office, we may have inactivated them,\" Guthrie said. \"A simple phone call or visit to our office should help you get squared away for the general election,\" Guthrie said. \"We’ll be reminding voters over the next few months to check up on their registration to make sure their voting experience in November goes as smoothly as possible.\" Check your voter status at washoecounty.gov/voters and click \" Update My Registration .\" Even if you are entirely removed from the voter rolls, Nevada has same-day registration . You must have a valid Nevada driver’s license or Nevada ID card, and you must vote in-person at a polling location. Why did voter numbers drop now? Washoe County has faced frequent criticism during public comment at commission meetings and in lawsuits from conservative groups over claims of people on the voter rolls who shouldn't be. The federal government, though, places restrictions on voter roll changes, and these sometimes keep counties from removing people even when they have good information indicating they are no longer an active voter. For example, the National Voting Rights Act doesn’t allow mass changes to voter rolls of the kind done in routine voter list maintenance 90 days before an election. Between Nevada’s June primary and the November general election, there’s a window of just a few weeks to do clean-up work. On June 26, Washoe County reported sending out more than 58,000 postcards to voters – 25,021 were for undeliverable ballots. The rest, Guthrie said, were sent to people who had some other situation that caused the county to send a notification card. These might be someone who interacted with the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles and said they didn’t want to be registered. Or it could be someone who contacted the Registrar of Voters’ office about a change of address or just wanted to double-check their registration. “If you're getting something from our office, it's either because there was a problem with your registration,” Guthrie said, “or there was some sort of transaction that you initiated with our office that prompted that correspondence.” The county then had until Aug. 6 to make mass changes to its voter lists. It can still remove voters who have died or when an individual reports moving or asks to be removed, even during the 90-day pre-election pause. More Democrats than Republicans made inactive in Washoe County In Washoe County, active registered Democrats dropped by 1,953 in July while Republicans dropped by 1,682. The county’s largest decrease came from nonpartisans, whose active rolls went down by 2,469. As of Thursday, Washoe County shows a total of 323,369 active voters: 104,477 Republicans, 98,062 nonpartisans, 96,411 Democrats and 24,419 affiliated with minor parties. How Washoe County voter registration changes compare with the rest of Nevada Washoe County had far and away the largest decrease in the number of registered voters of any county in the state over the past month, according to data provided by the Nevada Secretary of State’s office, which oversees elections. Clark County showed nearly 16,000 more registered voters. Douglas County also saw a sizable increase – as a percentage of total active voters, it saw a jump of about 3%. Because of Clark County’s big increase, the state itself saw an overall rise of 6,005 registered voters in July. Most counties, though, saw decreases. The biggest drops as a percent of active voters came in Carson City (down 6%), Humboldt County (4.5%), and Pershing and Storey counties (2.5%).

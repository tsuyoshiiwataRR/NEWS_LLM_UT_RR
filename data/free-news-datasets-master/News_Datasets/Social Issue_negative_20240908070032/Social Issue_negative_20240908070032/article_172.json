    "text": "Another one of the Disaster Recovery Centers set up in the wake of the Ruidoso wildfires and flooding over the summer is set to close on Tuesday. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced that it will close down a Disaster Recovery Center (DRC) located at the Angus Church of the Nazarene on Tuesday, Aug. 13, at 7 p.m. Similarly, a DRC that was operated by the State of New Mexico and FEMA at the Mescalero Library on the Mescalero Apache Reservation will cease operations under FEMA at 7 p.m. on Friday. Instead, it will transition to a Disaster Resource Center, located at the Mescalero Community Center, run by New Mexico’s Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management on Saturday. Disaster Case Managers will be on-site to assist residents with their recovery from the South Fork and Salt Fires and flooding from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Meanwhile, the DRC at the Horton Complex in Ruidoso is still providing help with the FEMA appeals process and applications, as well as hosting representatives from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), and state, local and nonprofit community organizations. That DRC is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday and closed on Sunday. FEMA reminded residents that it's imperative they keep in contact with agency, and provide it with the most up-to-date information, especially if situations change. For example, FEMA said that if someone reported their home had no disaster-related damage but later discovered damage, they shouldcontact FEMA to update their application or submit an appeal if they were denied assistance. Likewise, those with low-interest SBA disaster loans should call the SBA Disaster Assistance Customer Service Centerto update information or check the status of an application at: 800-659-2955; by email at disastercustomerservice@SBA.gov or via the SBA [website](sba.gov/disaster). Hard of hearing or deaf individuals may call 7-1-1 to access telecommunications relay services.

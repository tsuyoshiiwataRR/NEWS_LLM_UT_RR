    "text": "PORT CHESTER — Emergency repair crews were seen working to repair an apparent sinkhole Thursday morning before heavy rains are expected to arrive in the Lower Hudson Valley Friday afternoon. Port Chester officials discovered the sinkhole forming on Regent St. near the intersection of Clermont Ave. after part of the Bulkley storm sewer drain collapsed under the road. The exact cause behind the collapse of the storm drain was unknown, village manager Stuart Rabin said. Rabin said repairs are underway for the storm drain in preparation for the upcoming storm on Friday. “We are unable to confirm if the storm of this week cause for the damage,\" Rabin told reporters, \"but it certainly helped us identify the location of the collapse due to the road’s sinking.” Rabin said the repair of the system will include excavation, removal of debris, and the replacement of the natural stone tunnel/waterway with a concrete replacement to allow the stormwater to continue to flow. \"We have much larger storm water infrastructure planned for this area of the village that have been approved as well,\" Rabin said. According to the National Weather Service, Port Chester received 2.2 inches of rainfall due to Tuesday's storm. This story may update.",

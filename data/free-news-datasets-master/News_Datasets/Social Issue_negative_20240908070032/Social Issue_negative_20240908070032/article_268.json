    "text": "Cruise ships have doubled in size over the past two decades, a precedent that could lead to even bigger vessels plying our oceans in the future, bringing potential problems, a newly released report has warned.\nThe largest passenger vessels today are twice as large as they were in 2000, says a study conducted by European clean energy lobby group Transport and Environment (T&E) which warns of the environmental impact of the “rapidly” growing global cruise industry.\nThe report suggests that the biggest cruise ships setting sail in 2050 could be nearly eight times larger than the infamous Titanic, the largest passenger ship in service when it set sail in 1912 (measuring 269 meters or about 883 feet), if the growth rate continues as it is.\nDisney's Wonder cruise ship and Carnival's Fantasy taking to the waters in 2004.\nBruce Weaver/AFP/Getty Images via CNN Newsource “Today’s cruisezillas make the Titanic look like a small fishing boat,” Inesa Ulichina, sustainable shipping officer at T&E, said in a statement.",

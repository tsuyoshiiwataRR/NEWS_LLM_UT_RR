    "text": "RANCHI: Jharkhand HC Thursday directed the state govt to take immediate action against illegal Bangladeshi immigrants entering through the Santhal Parganas in the state.While hearing a PIL, a division bench of acting chief justice Sujit Narayan Prasad and Justice Arun Kumar Rai said Bangladesh is, at present, “politically unstable.”The bench ordered the director of Intelligence Bureau, DG of BSF, chief election commissioner and DG of UIDAI to be made parties in the case.The HC suggested that govt should conduct sudden inspection of Aadhaar cards and voter ID to identify bona fide residents of the state. These drives will help identify illegal settlers and deter others from trying to enter India, it added.HC also said that Centre and state govts should work together to tackle the problem of illegal immigration. The case would next be heard on Aug 22.The petition, filed by Daniel Danish, said immigrants from Bangladesh have entered Jharkhand and many have solemnized marriages in tribal community and settled down after buying land in the state.",

    "text": "NEW YORK — Seven years ago, after a series of subway failures so severe that a stretch of 2017 came to be known as the Summer of Hell, New York officials came up with a plan to make sure a crisis like that would never happen again.\nThrough a tolling program known as congestion pricing, they would raise enough money to restore the system to competency. This would ward off the kind of meltdowns that had left passengers stranded without service, trapped them in dark, hot cars, and injured them in derailments.\nNow, with congestion pricing on hold, experts warn that a return to hell is inevitable.\nThe tolling program would have generated $15 billion to fund critical infrastructure upgrades such as fixing century-old tunnels and crumbling tracks. Just weeks before officials were to begin collecting tolls in June, Governor Kathy Hochul canceled the plan. In doing so, climate change and engineering experts say, she left the continent’s biggest transportation network teetering on the brink of another crisis.\nAdvertisement\n“Concrete and steel, you poke holes in it, subject it to water and chemicals and salt for 100 years, it’s going to give out,” Janno Lieber, CEO of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said during a board meeting last week. “That is what’s happening, and we must do something about it.”\nBut the congestion pricing plan was politically unpopular, perhaps in part because the benefits to the system were harder to picture than the cost to motorists. A Siena College survey in April found that 63 percent of New York City residents opposed congestion pricing. It was even less popular among suburban respondents.\nIn other cities that have adopted congestion pricing, residents have initially reacted negatively, until the plans went into effect and positive effects were realized.\nHochul has said she halted the tolling plan because of New York City’s unstable economic recovery from the pandemic, though economists, business owners, and civic leaders have rebutted her logic.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the governor, John Lindsay, said Hochul was committed to funding the MTA’s capital plan after finding the money last year to save the authority from billions of dollars in deficits to its operating budget.\nAdvertisement\nHe said Hochul oversaw “the largest investment” in the agency’s repair plan in its history and added that she was “working with partners in government on funding mechanisms while congestion pricing is paused.”\nAn MTA spokesperson, Tim Minton, said in a statement that the authority has made strides in improving subway reliability in the past seven years by prioritizing infrastructure upgrades. An average of 84 percent of trains are on time this summer, he noted, compared with only 65 percent during the summer of 2017.\nBut, he added, “We need to maintain this high level of capital investment in order to confront new challenges, including those presented by global climate change.”\nThe disasters that happened during the Summer of Hell were not tied to a single malfunction but a string of engineering emergencies that resulted from decades of deferred repairs to the subway network, said Mona Hemmati, a scientist at Columbia University’s Climate School.\nThe subway’s limits were tested as recently as last month, when power outages and signal problems created lengthy delays for passengers who had to wait inside sweltering stations, where temperatures can surpass 100 degrees.\nRiders were unnerved in January when two separate and unrelated train derailments occurred within a week. A storm last fall shut down half the subway and brought much of the city to a standstill, underscoring the transit system’s difficulties dealing with bad weather intensified by climate change.\nHemmati said that during this time of year, rail operators often impose speed restrictions to reduce the risk of accidents caused by track deformations, which leads to delays.\n“Imagine how people will suffer in this heat in these stations where there is no fan, no air conditioning,” Hemmati said, adding that she nearly fainted from exposure while waiting for a train last month. “It’s a silent killer, and usually will result in more fatalities compared to storms and large-scale events like hurricanes.”\nAdvertisement\nRidership in the city has not rebounded to prepandemic levels; it’s now at about 70 percent of where it once was. When school begins in the fall, passenger counts are expected to reach their highest level in four years, and transit observers believe that the added strain on the system could further test its resiliency.\nCongestion pricing would have charged most drivers $15 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street during peak periods. It was designed to tamp down traffic and pollution while raising $1 billion annually for mass transit.\nLast month the MTA predicted deficits totaling nearly $900 million in 2027 and 2028 in its operating budget because of lower-than-expected revenues from passenger fares and real estate-related taxes. Without the proceeds from congestion pricing tolls, it expects additional operating budget losses of at least $640 million.\nUnable to afford new fleets of buses and train cars, it might have to pay more for emergency repairs and maintenance for older vehicles. The tolls were expected to nudge drivers out of their cars and into subways, buses and commuter rail lines, but now the system cannot count on what had been a projected ridership increase of 1.25 percent.\nHochul has vowed to find a way to plug the hole left by her decision to delay the program.\nLindsay noted that Hochul announced last week that she had found $54 million to revive work on a long-awaited extension of the Second Avenue subway line in Manhattan, a project that was deferred after her decision to pause congestion pricing. But transit advocates have scoffed at what they described as a paltry sum for a single project.\nAdvertisement",

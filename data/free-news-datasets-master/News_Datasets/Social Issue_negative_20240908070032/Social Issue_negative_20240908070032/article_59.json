In fact, food recalls are increasing. Yet, that might actually be a good sign. Here's why. USA TODAY The Boar's Head deli meat recall linked to a multi-state listeria outbreak has reportedly caused at least one more death and 10 new hospitalizations since late July. The additional cases come as health officials continue to investigate the outbreak that has caused at least three deaths, hospitalized at least another 40 people across 13 states and spawned multiple lawsuits. Boar's Head has recalled 71 products since July 26, equating to about 7.2 million pounds of deli meats.\nThe Boar's Head deli meat recall linked to a multi-state listeria outbreak has reportedly caused at least one more death and 10 new hospitalizations since late July, according to an update released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\nThe additional cases come as health officials continue to investigate the outbreak that has caused at least three deaths, hospitalized at least another 40 people across 13 states and spawned multiple lawsuits.\nSince the last wave of information was shared on July 31 , the number of affected people has continued to grow, with the most recent death occurring in Virginia. Nine additional cases of illness were also reported, bringing the total up to 43, all of whom ended up hospitalized, the CDC said Thursday.\nBoar's Head has recalled 71 products since July 26 , equating to about 7.2 million pounds of deli meats. The brand is also facing legal action, with at least one class-action suit on the books as of early August.\nHere's the most up-to-date information on the recall.\nListeria lawsuits: Boar's Head listeria outbreak triggers lawsuit against deli meat company in New York\nWhat Boar's Head products are recalled? Boar’s Head initially announced a recall for 207,528 pounds of liverwurst and other deli meats on July 26, followed by an expanded recall on July 30 to include over 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products.\nIn a July 30 statement from the company, Boar’s Head said that it initiated the expanded recall of all products produced at its Jarratt, Virginia facility after it learned that its Strassburger Brand Liverwurst had been linked to the national listeria outbreak.\nBoar’s Head Ready-to-Eat liverwurst products recalled\nProduced between June 11, 2024 and July 17, 2024, and have a 44-day shelf-life “Boar’s Head Strassburger Brand Liverwurst made in Virginia” 3.5-pound loaves in plastic casing, or various weight packages sliced in retail delis Sell-by dates range from July 25, 2024, to August 30, 2024\nOther Boar’s Head deli meat products\nBoar’s Head also recalled all deli products, including prepackaged deli products. Look for “EST. 12612” or “P-12612” inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels.\nMulti-state listeria outbreak kills three A listeria outbreak linked to sliced deli meat has led to 43 hospitalizations and three deaths in 13 states, according to an ongoing investigation by the CDC and U.S. Department of Agriculture. These numbers are up from the two deaths and 33 hospitalizations reported in late July.\nThe ages of the sick people range between 32 and 94, with the median being 75, CDC data showed. The three deaths were reported in Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia.\nThe CDC and USDA are currently aware of 13 states with infections as a result of the outbreak.\nThese states include:\nNew York: 14 Maryland: 8 New Jersey: 4 Massachusetts: 3 Missouri: 3 Virginia: 3 Georgia: 2 Minnesota: 1 Wisconsin: 1 Illinois: 1 Pennsylvania: 1 North Carolina: 1 Indiana: 1\nListeriosis or listeria poisoning symptoms Listeriosis, or listeria poisoning, is a foodborne bacterial infection most commonly caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. It is considered a serious condition and can be dangerous or life-threatening, especially to older adults, people with weak immune systems and pregnant women.\nAccording to the USDA, symptoms include:\nFever Muscle aches Headache Stiff neck Confusion Loss of balance Convulsions Diarrhea Other gastrointestinal symptoms Miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery and/or life-threatening infection of newborn infants Death People in higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food, said the USDA.\nWhat to do to stay safe The CDC advises people who are pregnant, 65 or older, or have weakened immune systems to take extra precautions to avoid becoming ill.\nAt-risk individuals should do as follows:\nDo not eat recalled deli meats. Throw them away or contact stores about returns. In addition, do not eat any other deli meats you get sliced at deli counters, unless it is reheated to an internal temperature of 165°F or until steaming hot. Let it cool before you eat it. Listeria can grow on foods kept in the refrigerator, but it is easily killed by heating food to a high enough temperature. Clean your refrigerator, containers and surfaces that may have touched sliced deli meats. This is especially important if you purchased any of the recalled deli products. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms: People who are not pregnant usually have fever, muscle aches, and tiredness. They may also get a headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or seizures. Pregnant people usually have fever, muscle aches, and tiredness. However, Listeria can cause pregnancy loss or premature birth. It can also cause serious illness or death in newborns.\nOne of the best ways to avoid listeriosis is to avoid foods that have not been properly stored or that may be more prone to carrying listeria bacteria. People who are at high risk, such as pregnant women and children, should avoid eating the following :\nUnpasteurized soft cheeses, such as queso fresco and brie. Unheated cheeses sliced at a deli. Unheated deli meat, cold cuts, hot dogs, and fermented or dry sausages. Premade deli salads, such as coleslaw and potato, tuna, or chicken salad. Refrigerated pâté or meat spreads. Refrigerated smoked fish. Raw or lightly cooked sprouts. Cut melon left out for more than 2 hours. One hour if it’s exposed to temperatures hotter than 90 degrees. Cut melon in refrigerator for more than a week. Raw (unpasteurized) milk, yogurt, and ice cream.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "text": "House Republicans Go After Anti-Israel Protests With ‘No Tax Dollars for College Encampments Act’\n“would prevent the disgraceful mob riots we saw overtake campuses across the country including Columbia University and make sure school leaders are enforcing policies against hostile campus takeovers”\n3 Comments\nEven if this doesn’t pass, it sends an important reminder to schools.\nThe College Fix reports:\nHouse Republicans introduce ‘No Tax Dollars for College Encampments Act’\nIn the wake of a tumultuous spring semester during which anti-Israel campus protests overtook dozens of universities and resulted in thousands of arrests and police interventions, top House Republicans have introduced a bill that seeks to better hold administrators accountable for such mayhem.\nThe “No Tax Dollars for College Encampments Act” was introduced July 1 by Republicans Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana and Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York. The\n[legislation]would require universities to publicly disclose their protest response policies to receive federal accreditation.\n“I am committed to ridding universities of the antisemitic rot corrupting our students and making campuses dangerous and unwelcoming to our Jewish communities,” Stefanik\n[said]in a news release.\n“This legislation would prevent the disgraceful mob riots we saw overtake campuses across the country including Columbia University and make sure school leaders are enforcing policies against hostile campus takeovers,” the congresswoman stated.\nThe bill, which seeks to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965, would also require universities “to adhere to their own procedures and reporting requirements when responding to civil unrest,”\n[according]to a news release from Bank’s office.\nIf approved, universities would be required to submit annual reports to the Department of Education reporting incidents of civil unrest and the measures campus leaders took in response.\nThe bill’s purpose is to enhance transparency, improve safety, and ensure accountability on campuses, the Republicans said in their news releases.\nSix other House Republicans and multiple policy organizations, including Heritage Action and Parents Defending Education Action, have\n[backed]the bill.\n“[W]e cannot sit idle while these college administrations allow these illegal encampments to continue,” Parents Defending Education Action states in a news release.\n[]https://legalinsurrection.com/subscribe/ DONATE\nDonations tax deductible\nto the full extent allowed by law.",

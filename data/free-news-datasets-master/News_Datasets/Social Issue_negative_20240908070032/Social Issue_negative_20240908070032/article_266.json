    "text": "ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas — A Lufkin man convicted of selling meth and possessing multiple firearms as a felon was sentenced to about 20 years in federal prison Thursday. John Richard Burch, Jr., 40, was found guilty by a jury on Aug. 16, 2023 of four counts of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and intent to distribute on a premises where children are present. He was then sentenced to 235 months on Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a news release. Information shown in court determined that law enforcement conducted an investigation into methamphetamine sales occurring at Burch’s Lufkin home in early 2022. Investigators seized a large amount of meth, marijuana, multiple digital scales used to weigh narcotics, small plastic baggies for packaging methamphetamine, a methamphetamine bong and nine firearms. Among the firearms were a semi-automatic rifle and a gun reported stolen in Livingston along with fully loaded 30-round magazine. Small children. who lived in the home, where present while investigators searched the home, according to the Department of Justice. Investigators learned that Burch has a previous felony conviction for theft and a conviction for assault family violence. Therefore, as a convicted felon, he's prohibited by federal law from owning or possessing firearms or ammunition. The Angelina County Sheriff’s Office, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and FBI worked together to investigate the case.",

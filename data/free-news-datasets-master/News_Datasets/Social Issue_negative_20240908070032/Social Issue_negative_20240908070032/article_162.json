    "text": "As the U.S. men's Olympic basketball team advanced in the\n2024 Paris Olympics, an online rumor alleged the International Olympic Committee (IOC) launched an investigation into NBA star LeBron James for using performance-enhancing drugs, specifically naming a supposed weight-loss product called Rapid Lean Keto + ACV Gummies.\nHowever, this rumor was false. Further, it's connected to a dangerous and long-running scam promoting keto gummies for weight loss.\nThe LeBron James Scam Began in Facebook Ads\nThe rumor, or scam, appeared in several Facebook advertisements in early August. One ad displayed a photo of James with the words \"We Say Goodbye.\" The text of the ad read, \"LeBron Might Sit Out After Paris\" and \"This 'Booster' turned up in his locker.\"\nAs we have previously\nreported, similar Facebook and Instagram ads target celebrities — such as Oprah Winfrey, Kelly Clarkson and others — by falsely saying they have endorsed keto gummies, purportedly for weight loss.\nIn reality, no famous people have ever endorsed any products described as keto gummies for weight loss.\nFake ESPN Article Promoted LeBron James Scam\nThe link in the Facebook ads directed users to a fake ESPN\narticle ( archived) hosted on the scam website greenteamgt.com. The headline read, \"Questions Surround LeBron James As Investigation Dives Into His 'Performance Enhancers.'\"\nESPN never published this page. It was a fictional story. The article, with its many false claims about James' supposed use of Rapid Lean Keto + ACV Gummies, began, in part:\n(ESPN) - With a total of 4 NBA championships and 2 Olympic medals under his belt at the age of 39, there is no doubt that LeBron James is one of the greatest basketball players of our time. However, his most recent blood test is raising eyebrows within the Olympic Commission.\nAccording to the report, his Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) was incredibly high, indicating a higher resting metabolism, and he had an outrageously high Resting Energy Expenditure (REE). What does this mean to someone without a doctorate in Health Science? According to his charts James is somehow able to burn calories at 145% higher than average.\nJames credits his incredible metabolism to the popular supplement, Rapid Lean, a popular weight loss product, that has yet to be banned by the Olympics.\nFor the average user, Rapid Lean is a product that is purported to be highly a effective weight loss supplement, but in the hands of a pro athlete, the results appear to be a complete game changer.\nWhen asked about the controversy surrounding Rapid Lean, James responded with this:\n\"I understand the concern people have, but Rapid Lean is not a dangerous performance enhancer. It's simply a natural product that helps me boost energy and burn fat. And frankly, more people need to know about it.\"\nAgain, James never made any of the statements mentioned in the fake ESPN article.\nAbout the Rapid Lean Keto + ACV Gummies Scam Website\nLinks in the fake ESPN article directed users to another scam page hosted on\nrapidleanbrands.com. That page falsely claimed CBS News, NBC, CNN, Women's Health, Dr. Mehmet Oz and other prominent sources provided favorable reviews of the purported gummies.\nThe same page also misleadingly advertised \"free\" bottles of the gummies — when, in reality, any user who signed up would receive charges amounting to hundreds of dollars as part of a monthly subscription.\nThe Rapid Lean Keto + ACV Gummies website listed (855) 485-8926 as a phone number and care@buyrapidlean.com as an email address. The website featured in the email address —\nbuyrapidlean.com — listed its \"location\" as a mailbox inside a UPS Store in Highlands Ranch, Colorado.\nHistorically, customer service personnel assigned to field inquiries from victims of these scams follow scripts. Those scripts generally only offer a 50% refund to customers asking for money back. Readers who fall victim to these scams should contact their credit card company to alert them to the scam, ask if it's possible to obtain a full refund and block future recurring charges from the same seller.\nFTC Takes Action Against Alleged Gummy Scammers\nOn July 1, weeks before these scam ads started circulating on Facebook, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced in a\nnews release its action against \"two related groups\" that allegedly defrauded consumers nationwide by signing them up for similar recurring charges without their consent. It's unclear if, or to what extent, they included creators of the scam targeting James.\nThe release began:\nA U.S. district court in central Florida today unsealed a Federal Trade Commission complaint charging two related groups of defendants with defrauding consumers nationwide by enrolling them, without their knowledge, into continuity plans where they are shipped and charged repeatedly for personal care products that they did not agree to purchase.\nThe defendants allegedly deceived consumers with ads for \"free\" CBD and Keto-related personal care products, billing many for products they did not consent to purchase, signing many up for unwanted continuity plans, and debiting money from their bank accounts without prior authorization. In addition, the FTC alleges that some of the defendants laundered credit card payments by setting up bank accounts for shell companies using straw signers.\n\"These defendants bilked consumers out of millions of dollars by repeatedly charging them for products they never ordered or agreed to purchase,\" said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. \"The FTC is committed to aggressively pursuing companies and individuals involved in these unauthorized billing scams.\"\nWe will update this story if we uncover any further information about the complaint and/or scam targeting James.",

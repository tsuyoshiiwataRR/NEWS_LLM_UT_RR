    "text": "The United Kingdom’s Met Police Chief has threatened “keyboard warriors” with domestic terrorism charges if they continue to use free speech online. Head of the Met Police Sir Mark Rowley has warned that “inciting riots” will be dealt with harshly.\nAnd by inciting riots, he means, people who type things online, not those who actually commit violent crimes.\nHead of the Met Police Sir Mark Rowley warns even people abroad will be arrested for mean posts. He seems to infer also\n[@elonmusk].\nWith the First Amendment I don’t think an extradition request it’d get past the most under qualified lawyer.\n[pic.twitter.com/buX0Tmc82V]\n— David Atherton (@DaveAtherton20)\n[August 8, 2024]\n“And whether you’re in this country committing crimes on the streets or committing crimes from further afield online, we will come after you,” Rowley threatened. A Sky News reporter then mentioned Elon Musk as a “high profile figure” who was “whipping up hatred,” when in fact Musk merely asked Prime Minister Keir Starmer, “Why aren’t all communities protected in Britain?”\n“What are you considering when it comes to dealing with people who are whipping up from behind a keyboard and maybe is in a different country,” the reporter asked Rowley,\naccording to a report by Modernity News.\n“Being a keyboard warrior does not make you safe from the law, you can be guilty of offenses of incitement, of stirring up racial hatred, there are numerous terrorist offenses regarding the publishing of material, all of those offenses are in play if people are provoking hatred and violence on the streets and we will come after those individuals just as we will physically confront on the streets the thugs and the yobs who are causing the problems for communities,” said Rowley.\nRemember, the “law” is what the ruling class has come up with in order to keep the slaves in line. Rowley is simply “doing his job” by keeping the rulers in power and oppressing the already owned.\nWhat is also disturbing, is that Stephen Parkinson, the Director of Public Prosecutions,\n told Sky News that people do not even need to personally post the content themselves to be deemed to be committing an offence.\nParkinson said social media users could be guilty of “incitement to racial hatred” if they post “insulting or abusive” content that is “likely to stir up racial hatred.”\nThis is straight-up tyrannical and the ruling class knows it. It is now up to those being controlled and ruled over to figure it out.\nAbolitionists Understand True Freedom: It’s Time For The Rest Of Us To Understand It Too",

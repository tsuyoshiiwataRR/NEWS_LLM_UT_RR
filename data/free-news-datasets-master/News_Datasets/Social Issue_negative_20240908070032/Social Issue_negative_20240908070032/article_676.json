    "text": "Noah Lyles was denied an Olympic double in Paris as he finished third in Thursday's 200m final , but the post-race revelation that Lyles took part in the sprint following a positive COVID-19 diagnosis has sparked significant controversy and could have huge ramifications as the Summer Olympic Games wind down this coming weekend.\nLyles, who won the 100m sprint in a photo finish, has quickly seen his hero status wiped away amid frustration from fans that he opted to race on Thursday despite testing positive for COVID -- and entering isolation -- two days prior. The controversy has led many to question what the health and safety protocols are at the Olympics amid a summer surge in COVID cases.\n\"Don't let a cold keep you from the gold\" According to NBC News , at least 40 athletes -- now including Lyles -- have tested positive for COVID during the Summer Olympic Games. COVID spikes during the summer months have been common since the pandemic began in 2020, and strict restrictions were in place for the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo (held in 2021) and the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing .\nNot anymore. The 2024 Summer Games has had no mandatory, preventive measures in place to slow infection rates. Masking and testing have not been required, but an International Olympics Committee spokesperson told NBC that the organization is \" following good practices in managing infectious diseases \" at Paris 2024 .\nSo Noah Lyles ran just now fully knowing that he had Covid. Bet the other athletes are chuffed knowing they have relays tomorrow\n? Cat (@jammycat8) August 8, 2024 The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee implemented its own preventive program under the slogan \" don't let a cold keep you from the gold .\" It encouraged athletes like Lyles -- who was visibly exhausted and laid down to the track following the 200m sprint -- to wash their hands frequently and to wear masks during long travel periods.\nBefore race:\nAfter Race:\nAll the sudden, he has covid and a wheel chair\nArrogant with excuses\nNoah Lyles is a clown https://t.co/OOXmURFVrF pic.twitter.com/pW2vPAWTWZ\n? Brandon (@clickthatfollow) August 8, 2024 Even though officials were confident that the 2024 Summer Olympics would not be a \"superspreader event,\" dozens have cases have now been confirmed and an athlete was permitted to race in spite of a positive COVID test. Only time will tell as to whether the IOC reconsiders its stance or finds a way to minimize the present damage.\nIn the meantime, Lyles -- who embraced 200m gold medallist Letsile Tebogo following the race and exited the track in a wheelchair -- has been called \"selfish\" and \"arrogant\" for running while infected, which has potentially endangered other athletes at the Games.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (TND) — MSNBC’s Joy Reid argued Tuesday that Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., was the “safest” running mate pick for Vice President Kamala Harris partly because he is White like a “mayonnaise sandwich on Wonder bread.” “He to me would’ve been the safest, most conventionally safe pick,” Reid said in a TikTok video . “White, super White like ... mayonnaise sandwich on Wonder bread white.” Sen. Kelly was one of several candidates Harris was reportedly considering to be her running mate before she chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The Arizona lawmaker has received attention for his ability to earn votes in the state, which has mostly favored Republican candidates for the past 70 years. He also stepped into the spotlight when his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, was shot in a 2011 attack at a Tucson, Arizona meeting with her constituents. The two founded an organization to end gun violence two years later, vowing to “balance the influence” of lobbyists opposing firearm restrictions. Sen. Kelly’s twin brother has earned recognition at the national level as well, with NASA conducting and later promoting a study using the two astronauts’ genetic makeup. Each of the family members could have helped Harris and Sen. Kelly attract voters, according to Reid. “A very empathetic wife, Gabby Giffords, who was a victim of gun violence, so a huge advocate on that issue. He has a twin, like, it would’ve been a cool story,” she said. Speculation surrounding Sen. Kelly as a running mate pick also rose because of his state’s geopolitical position. Arizona has been home to the highest number of stops of immigrants by Customs and Border Protection since October. He urged his colleagues to pass Harris-supported legislation that would have funded border security initiatives as well. Reid argued the senator could have made a “strong argument” for the vice president's handling of immigration issues. Following Harris’s selection of Gov. Walz, Sen. Kelly pledged support for the Democratic ticket. “Vice President @KamalaHarris and Governor @Tim_Walz are going to move us forward,” the lawmaker posted on X. “They’re already building a campaign to unite our country — and @GabbyGiffords and I are ready to do everything we can to help them win.” Have questions, concerns or tips?

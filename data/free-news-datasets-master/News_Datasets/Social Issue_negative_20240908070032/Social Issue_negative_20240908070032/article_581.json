    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - A public hearing to discuss crimes committed by illegal immigrants with members of the Missouri House of Representatives is set to be held in Kansas City.\nThe Missouri House Special Interim Committee on Illegal Immigrant Crimes has announced that at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 13, it will host a public hearing in Kansas City. This will mark the third of six hearings to be held statewide.\nHouse officials noted that the hearing is set to take place at the KC Library - Plaza Branch, in the Truman Forum Auditorium at 4801 Main St.\nCommittee members indicated that the hearing is a chance for community members to share their perspectives and insights on matters that concern illegal immigrant crime. They intend to foster an open dialogue to inform future legislative efforts and policies.\n“I encourage all interested parties to participate in the hearing,” said Rep. Lane Roberts, R-Joplin . “Public input is crucial as we work towards developing effective strategies to tackle illegal immigrant crime and ensure the safety and well-being of our communities.”\nThe committee, which was formed in response to concerns about immigrant crime in the Show-Me State, said it will collaborate with law enforcement to assess criminal activity that involves illegal immigrants. Members will create data-driven solutions and evidence-based policies to reduce this type of crime and reinforce the safety and well-being of all.\nIndividuals, organizations and experts have been invited to share testimonies, experiences and recommendations related to the topic.\nFor more information, click HERE .\nCopyright 2024 KCTV.

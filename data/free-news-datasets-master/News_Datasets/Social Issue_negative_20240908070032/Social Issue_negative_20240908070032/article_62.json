    "text": "By Ashley ,\n3 hours ago A former fuel truck driver pleaded guilty to charges related to a deliberate fuel spill that occurred in Pennsylvania in 2021.\nNew Jersey resident George Smith, 39, pleaded guilty in a Delaware County court to felony prohibition against other pollution and felony causing a catastrophe, according to Patch.com .\nThe charges stem from a gas dumping incident that occurred near an elementary school in Brookhaven, Pennsylvania, in 2021 , killing wildlife and forcing the the school into a long-term closure.\nSmith was accused of dumping 4000 gallons of gas on June 11, 2021, at the Gas N Go in Brookhaven in an attempt to speed up his work day.\nAs his work day began, Smith filled up with 8500 gallons of gas to begin his daily deliveries.\nSmith reportedly deviated from his route and went first to a Gas N Go location that was meant to be his last stop. Because another tanker truck driver had already delivered to that location earlier in the day, Smith was only able to fill up the gas station’s underground tanks with 4500 gallons of gas.\nAuthorities say that Smith would have had to make a partial fill up at his next stop and then go back to the fuel depot, adding time to his day’s deliveries.\nSurveillance video showed Smith at the Gas N Go location placing the fuel hose on the ground next to the guard rail and dumping the remaining 4000 gallons of gas down an embankment.\n“We have determined that the defendant’s deliberate actions caused this fuel discharge. Motivated by a desire to speed up his route, the defendant poured in excess of 4000 gallons of gasoline over an embankment bordering an elementary school – causing damage to a nearby stream, wildlife and vegetation and resulting in the closure of the school. As a fuel delivery driver, the defendant was entrusted with a hazardous product – gasoline – and he owed a duty of care to all of us. He chose self-interest over the safety of the Brookhaven community and the safety of the children at Coebourn Elementary School. One of my first actions as District Attorney was to establish an Environmental Crimes Unit, and this prosecution should send a message that we will pursue and prosecute those who commit crimes against our environment,” said Delaware County District Attorney Stollsteimer when charges were announced in 2021 .\nMore than 100 truck’s worth of contaminated soil were removed from the area.\nThe post Driver accused of dumping 4000 gallons of gas ‘to speed up his route’ pleads guilty appeared first on CDLLife .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

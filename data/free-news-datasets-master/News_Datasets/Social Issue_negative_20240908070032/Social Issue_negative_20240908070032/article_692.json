    "text": "WASHINGTON (Gray DC) - About 35% of Americans said tipping culture in America is out of control, an increase of 5% over last year, according to a Bankrate study.\nTed Rossman with Bankrate said a lot of people are annoyed about pre-enter tip screens that pop up at coffee shops, food trucks, and elsewhere.\n“There’s a lot of tip creep that goes on as in being asked to tip in unconventional settings. And sometimes that leads to guilt tipping where you say yes even though you didn’t really want to,” Rossman explained. “And you hit 15 or 20% on the terminal. A lot of people leave feeling negative about these kinds of experiences. And a lot of people, about 4 in 10, think businesses should just pay their staff better.”\nInflation is a big part of the story, because people already feel squeezed. Prices are up, money is tight, and the tip is just one more thing – sort of a hidden surcharge – at the end of a purchase.\n“I do think we should separate places where we ought to be tipping like restaurants and hair salons and barber shops from places where it’s more optional,” Rossman shared. “I don’t think you always need to tip at the counter where you’re just picking up a sandwich or a coffee. But if you’re not tipping well at a restaurant that’s a big deal, because the federal tip minimum wage is $2.13 an hour.”\nRossman said waiters and waitresses rely on these tips. He said what surprised him most was that only a third of Gen-Zers who go to sit down restaurants are always tipping.\nHe noted only about half of millennials are always tipping at restaurants, whereas it’s much higher for the older generations: 78% of Gen X and 80% of Boomers.\nCopyright 2024 Gray DC.

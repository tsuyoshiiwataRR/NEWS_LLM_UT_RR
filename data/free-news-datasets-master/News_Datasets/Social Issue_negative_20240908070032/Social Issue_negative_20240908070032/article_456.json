    "text": "Tim Walz built his career feigning support for the Second Amendment and fundraising as a “pro-gun” Democrat who backstabbed gun owners nearly every chance he got. Gun Owners of America first rated Tim Walz as a “D.” Later, we downgraded him to an F after a litany of anti-gun votes. So why did he earn such poor marks from the only No Compromise gun lobby in Washington D.C.?\nRepresentative Tim Walz’s Voting Record\nTim Walz was first elected to Congress in 2006 and in his tenure up till 2018, he voted against gun owners consistently. In Congress, Tim Walz:\n❌ Voted to create a national registry of concealed carry permit holders.\n❌ Voted against the First and Second Amendments by attempting to force GOA to disclose our membership list (as a registry) to create a gun owner registry for the Federal Election Commission;\n❌ Voted to expose gun owners’ personal medical history, leading to bans and confiscation;\n❌ Voted to restrict the ability of Gun Owners and Hunters to use the Washington Rochambeau National Historic Trail area to create a 600 mile gun-free zone for sportsmen and hikers; and\n❌ Voted to ban carrying firearms for self-defense in national parks.\nThese votes caused Gun Owners of America to rightfully downgrade Walz from a “D” to an “F.”\nWhat Gun Control Does Governor Tim Walz Support?\nDuring his career as a congressman, Tim Walz feigned support for the Second Amendment, even though his record showed otherwise. But since becoming Governor of Minnesota, he has completely come out of the closet to reveal his true colors. Hiding behind his hunter and veteran “status” he proclaimed support for:\n👎Backdoor gun registration checks (by weaponizing background checks);\n👎Gun confiscation laws (with fake due process);\n👎A “no-fly, no-buy” gun ban (with no due process);\n👎Eliminating concealed carry permit reciprocity between states (to infringe on self-defenders);\n👎A backdoor semiautomatic firearms ban (with a fake “bump stock ban);\n👎Banning commonly owned self-defense firearms (with a so-called “assault weapons” ban)\n👎Mandatory storage requirements (with criminal penalties for access to self-defense firearms);\n👎Banning firearms on government lands (despite them being open to the public);\nClearly, being a hunter or a veteran does not automatically make a politician pro-Second Amendment.\nGovernor Tim Walz Is Responsible for These Infringements\nGovernor Walz didn’t just propose gun control, he actively infringed on the Second Amendment. As governor, Tim Walz:\n❌ Created backdoor registration checks by signing Universal Background Checks;\n❌ Weaponized gun confiscation laws with no due process against at least 71 American citizens; and\n❌ Banned lawful semiautomatic firearms with ATF-approved binary triggers;\nThese gun controls would never have infringed the rights of Minnesotans if Governor Walz had honored his oath to the Constitution.",

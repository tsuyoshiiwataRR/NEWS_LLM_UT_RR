    "text": "The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has largely been inert and stagnant over the years. It seems that the organization has forgotten the fundamental objectives which were visualized at its inception in 1969. The main purposes of the OIC included protecting the Palestinian people from Israeli aggression, enhancing the quality of life of Muslims living all around the globe, and fostering cooperation among the Islamic countries. However, the organization has failed to achieve its goals. For instance, since October 7, Israel has been continuing its genocide of the Palestinians largely unimpeded, killing more than 40,000 people including children and women. Iran is also being victimized as the West seeks to destabilize the country. The sudden assassination of Ismail Haniyeh backs this view. Amidst all this, the OIC has largely failed to stand by its brethren countries and has provided little in terms of concrete assistance. All OIC members need to be vigilant and safeguard the interests of Muslims globally. Israeli barbarism can be stopped if the OIC takes firm action against it.

( [WRDW](https://www.wrdw.com/2024/08/07/new-details-emerge-baby-death-that-led-3-arrests/)/Gray News) - Three people were arrested when a baby died after being wrapped in a wet blanket and placed in front of an air conditioner, according to police. According to arrest warrants, 3-month-old Josiah Noel Seright was found unresponsive at a Budget Inn hotel in Augusta, Georgia, early Tuesday. Richmond County Coroner Mark Bowen said Josiah was pronounced dead at 2:30 a.m. at the hospital on Tuesday. The three suspects, the baby’s mother, 19-year-old September De’Asia Seright, 42-year-old Diane Lamish Seright and 39-year-old Antonio Bennie Nash were charged with felony murder and child cruelty in the second degree. According to arrest warrants, Josiah was wrapped in a wet blanket in his car seat in the hotel bathroom while September Seright was in the shower. September Seright then placed Josiah in front of the air conditioner, set at 61 degrees, “for an unknown amount of time” while she was lying on a couch and the other two suspects were lying in a bed, according to the arrest warrants. The investigation is ongoing. Copyright 2024 WRDW via Gray Local Media, Inc. All rights reserved.",

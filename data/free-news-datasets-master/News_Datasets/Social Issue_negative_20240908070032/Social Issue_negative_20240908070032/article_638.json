    "text": "The Big Lots store in Portland will close this year as part of a major scaling back by the national discount retail chain.\nBig Lots, Inc. previously disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it would close 35-40 stores this year. In a July 31 SEC filing , the company asked to up that number to as many as 315 stores.\nThe Portland store at 1,100 Brighton Ave. is the only one of the companyâ€™s five Maine stores marked for closure . Other Big Lots stores are in Auburn, Augusta, Brunswick and Farmington.\nThe planned closure comes just shy of a decade after Big Lots pulled the plug on its Bangor store in January 2015.\nAt that time, the Bangor Daily News reported that Big Lots operated 1,400 stores nationwide. Today it has 1,389 stores, according to its website .",

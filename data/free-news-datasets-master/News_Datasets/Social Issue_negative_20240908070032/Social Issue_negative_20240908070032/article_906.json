The weapons used were seized, and efforts are ongoing to apprehend additional suspects who have been identified, according to a statement by the Public Security Directorate (PSD).\nThe PSD also reported that 210 vehicles were ticketed in various governorates, adding that all vehicles involved in the violations would be impounded, with legal and administrative actions taken against the offenders.\nThe directorate noted that these actions were the result of patrol deployments and responses to reports and complaints received through designated hotlines.\nThe directorate expressed gratitude to all those who contributed to maintaining security and reporting violations, emphasising that it will continue to work firmly and take strict measures against all violators.",

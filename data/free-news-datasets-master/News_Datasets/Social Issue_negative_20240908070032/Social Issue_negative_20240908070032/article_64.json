    "text": "Languages: Français | Deutsch Print Email Facebook X LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram\nUpdates This post has been updated to add a post by X's global government affairs team. Social media giant X has suspended the processing of some personal data from EU users’ public posts to train AI models, two days after the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) launched court proceedings over the practice.\nThis was the first time a leading data protection authority had decided to seek a court order to suspend a platform’s data processing activities , the DPC said about it the court proceedings .\nFollowing the court filing, X agreed to suspend the processing of personal data from EU users’ public posts collected between 7 May and 1 August to train the Grok AI model, the DPC said.\nThe Irish DPC is responsible for overseeing compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for many Big Tech platforms, as many of their European headquarters are in Dublin.\nThe timeframe for which the suspension applies relates to X’s request for consent, reported Irish Examiner .\nThe data processing started on 7 May to train Grok and X gradually introduced an opt-out option for users from 16 July, the judge hearing the case said, according to the Irish Examiner .\nX’s suspension will hold until the court decided on the DPC’s request, a lawyer representing X told the Irish newspaper.\nGrok is developed by Elon Musk-founded xAI and is a search assistant for premium accounts on the social media platform.\nAsked to comment on this story, X pointed Euractiv to a 9 August post from its government affairs team which reads: “We are pleased that people using X in the EU can continue to use Grok and control how their data is used with a simple privacy setting. We will continue to work with the DPC about Grok and other AI matters as we have been doing since last year. ”\nIn a Tuesday post, the same team said that the court case unfairly singled out X.\n“ X directly communicated to users how it uses data to train AI and X’s policies have been updated since 2023 to better reflect that,” the post reads.\nDigital rights activists praised the DPC’s decision to take X to court, saying it showed the authority appeared to have turned a new page on enforcement under new leadership.\nThe Irish DPC had engaged extensively with X on the issue prior to filing the court case, the data watchdog said.\nOn Monday (5 August), consumer groups alleged that X was in breach of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU’s landmark data protection law, in a complaint filed with the Irish DPC .\nIn June, Meta similarly halted plans to train AI models with the personal data of EU users from public posts, following data protection complaints .\n[Edited by Daniel Eck]\nRead more with Euractiv UK competition authority launches merger inquiry into Amazon-Anthropic partnership The UK's main competition watchdog has formally opened an investigation into the merger between Amazon and AI company Anthropic, a statement released on Thursday (8 August) reads.",

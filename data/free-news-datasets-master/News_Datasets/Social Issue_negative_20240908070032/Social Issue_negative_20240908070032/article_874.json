    "text": "Gainesville businesses will see an increase in trash fees, while residential fees are set to be reconsidered GAINESVILLE, Fla. (WCJB) -The Gainesville City Commission is considering increasing trash fees to support its zero waste goals. At their meeting today, commissioners did not follow through with the full proposal to raise trash pickup rates. Rates will go up for companies that pick up commercial trash, but a plan to raise residential rates is going back to the drawing board. RELATED: [Gainesville commissioners consider raising residential garbage cart fees](https://www.wcjb.com/2024/08/08/gainesville-commissioners-consider-raising-residential-garbage-cart-fees/) Taking out the trash might end up costing more. City commissioners approved raising the fee commercial haulers pay to pick up trash from 10- to 15- percent. They did not approve a plan to raise residential rates. Nevertheless, some say it’s worth it. The Gainesville zero waste ordinance was adopted in 2022 and the city is hopeful to have zero waste by 2040. The fees are expected to bring in about 2.9 million dollars a year. Some residents are hopeful this proposal will help with litter. Gainesville resident, Michael Ekbladh said, “If you have ever driven out of town and seen the dump where our trash goes. You won’t argue that we need a trash fee increase. We have to take care of our environment and it costs money to do that “. City leaders aim to make Gainesville an appealing area for residents and visitors. Litter makes the city unattractive. “When people come to this city it’s important that they understand we are good stewards of our property of the city at large, and that they understand that trash deserves to be put in certain places. It deserves to be recycled and so definitely making sure the city is clean is a priority” added Commissioner Desmon Duncan-Walker.

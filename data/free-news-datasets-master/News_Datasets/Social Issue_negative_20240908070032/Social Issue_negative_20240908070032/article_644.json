    "text": "By Yaffee August 8, 2024 Share Facebook Twitter Email (U.S. CBP/Flickr) Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall is making the legal case that illegal aliens should not be receiving healthcare benefits from the federal government.\nMarshall joined a coalition of 16 states in filing a lawsuit to stop the Biden-Harris administration from allowing illegal aliens from receiving the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare).\n“The latest assault on the American worker by the Biden-Harris administration is forcing tax paying American citizens to subsidize Obamacare for illegal aliens,” Marshall said. “Not only is this unconstitutional, but it is just plain wrong.”\nThe final plan, set to take effect November 1, would make more than 200,000 deferred actions for childhood arrival (DACA) recipients eligible for taxpayer-subsidized health plans, including 3,460 in Alabama.\nDACA is and executive order that was put forward by then President Barack Obama. It is an immigration policy that allows some individuals with unlawful presence in the United States after being brought to the country as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit in the U.S.\n“First, this administration is demanding that hardworking Americans pay for someone else’s college degree, then it forces them to pay for medical procedures that violate their beliefs, and now they want to dictate paying for healthcare for people who shouldn’t even be in this country,” Marshall said. “At some point the taxpayers are going to run out of money to give the government to fund their ill-conceived entitlement programs.”\nMarshall said that the new regulation announced by the Department of Health and Human Services violates the plain text of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, itself.\n“In the ACA,” the complaint reads, “Congress limited eligibility to participate in a qualified health plan through a subsidized health exchange to citizens or nationals of the United States and individuals ‘lawfully present’ in the United States.”\nAccording to the complaint, the proposed rule also violates a federal law that prohibits giving public benefits to aliens.\nIn addition to Attorney General Marshall and Kansas Attorney General Kobach, attorneys general from Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Virginia also joined the suit.\nYaffee is a contributing writer to Yellowhammer News and hosts “The Yaffee Program” weekdays 9-11 a.m. on WVNN .

    "text": "Two national pharmacy retailers are closing stores across the country, how does this affect Santa Clarita locations? Walgreens and CVS are closing stores across the country. Walgreens announced in late June that it plans to close up to a quarter of its 8,000 stores nationwide by 2027. CVS is in the midst of a three-year plan to close 900 stores, aiming at approximately 300 store closures a year, according to the pharmacy chain. Instead of operating more locations, the brand would focus on converting smaller stores into “health hubs” offering diagnostic testing, mental health services and hearing services, according to [CVS](https://www.hometownstation.com/santa-clarita-news/coronavirus/cvs-to-administer-covid-19-vaccines-at-100-california-locations-including-l-a-county-365265) officials. “The company has been evaluating changes in population, consumer buying patterns, and future health needs to ensure it has the [right kinds of stores](https://www.hometownstation.com/santa-clarita-news/crime/santa-clarita-deputies-arrest-suspect-in-walgreens-robbery-90880) in the right locations for consumers and for the business,” CVS said in a 2021 statement. Meanwhile, Walgreens also aims to complete its three-year plan of shuttering 900 stores by the end of this year. The company has roughly 10,000 remaining retail locations. As of Thursday morning, no information is available as to the future of the five [Walgreens](https://www.walgreens.com/storelocator/find.jsp) and seven [CVS](https://www.cvs.com/store-locator/landing) locations in Santa Clarita.

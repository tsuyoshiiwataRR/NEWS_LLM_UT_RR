    "text": "Please forgive me, but I'm in severe pain and need to vent my frustration. Toothache began on Monday, but it was mild so I thought I'd wait and see if it settled down. By Tuesday morning it was quite bad, so I went through the NHS list online, trying to find a dentist accepting patients. None in my area, so I rang 111, which has a line dedicated to dental queries. Spoke to a lovely lady who said she would refer me for emergency treatment to a dentist about 4 miles away. She said to wait 10 minutes and then ring them, saying it's a 111 referral. When I rang, the receptionist said there weren't any NHS appointments, she'd ring me back when one became available but couldn't give any idea of when that might be. She was very snooty and dismissive. This morning the pain was even worse, so I rang Ms Snooty again. She said there were still no NHS appointments and, when pressed, said it would be 3 weeks or longer before I could expect an emergency appointment! At this point, I rang 111 again and spoke to another lovely lady, who gave me a list of other dentists to try. There was only one on the list who could give me an emergency appointment before next week - 53 miles away! So I'm going tomorrow, but fuming about having to travel such a long way, not to mention being left in pain for so long. I know the NHS is under huge pressure, but surely I'm not being unreasonable to think this is unacceptable?",

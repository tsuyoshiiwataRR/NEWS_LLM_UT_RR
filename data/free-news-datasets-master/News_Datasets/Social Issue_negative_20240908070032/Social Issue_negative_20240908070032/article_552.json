    "text": "USA TODAY Sports released its 2024 Preseason US LBM Coaches Poll on Monday. USC was placed right outside the top 20 at No. 23 overall.\nThe US LBM Coaches Poll is voted on by a panel of AFCA-member FBS head coaches who are chosen from a pool of coaches willing to participate. Each coach submits a Top 25 team rankings list weekly, with a first-place vote worth 25 points, second-place worth 24 points, and so on. This year’s panel includes 55 coaches from across the country, representing the major conferences and independent schools that will be competing this season. The coaches ranking results are published by USA TODAY Sports online on Sundays and in print on Mondays during the college football season.\nThis will be the longest season in college football history with the start of an expanded College Football Playoff system that features 12 teams competing in the playoff tournament.\nHere’s a look at the full preseason US LBM Coaches Poll from USA TODAY Sports:\nRank Team Points 1st Place Votes 1 Georgia 1,364 46 2 Ohio State 1,302 7 3 Oregon 1,228 — 4 Texas 1,223 1 5 Alabama 1,077 – 6 Ole Miss 1,019 – 7 Notre Dame 969 – 8 Michigan 944 1 9 Penn State 889 – 10 Florida State 867 – 11 Missouri 808 – 12 LSU 742 – 13 Utah 665 – 14 Clemson 657 – 15 Tennessee 621 – 16 Oklahoma 609 – 17 Kansas State 416 – 18 Oklahoma State 359 – 19 Miami (Fl) 292 – 20 Texas A&M 273 – 21 Arizona 230 – 22 North Carolina State 216 – 23 USC 199 – 24 Kansas 186 – 25 Iowa 144 – Others Receiving Votes Washington 123; Louisville 95; Virginia Tech 64; SMU 47; Memphis 44; Boise State 30; Auburn 25; West Virginia 22; Wisconsin 17; Liberty 15; Iowa State 15; Kentucky 12; Florida 11; South Carolina 10; North Carolina 6; UNLV 5; Maryland 5; UCF 4; Texas Tech 4; UTSA 3; Tulane 2; Texas State 2; Nebraska 2; Colorado 2; Appalachian State 2; Troy 1; Syracuse 1; Miami (OH) 1; James Madison 1; Air Force 1\nYou may be wondering who are the biggest threats to USC this season in the top 25 of the preseason polls. Let’s take a deeper dive as we rank the hardest teams in the path for the Trojans in 2024.\n1. Penn State Nittany Lions\nMatthew O’Haren-USA TODAY Sports\nNo. 9 Penn State is the biggest threat to beat USC and keep the Trojans out of the Big Ten and CFB Playoff races this year.\nHead coach James Franklin begins his 11th season as Penn State’s head coach with a roster that returns 16 starters, including seven each on offense and defense led by quarterback Drew Allar.\n2. Notre Dame Fighting Irish\nMatt Cashore-USA TODAY Sports\nNo.7 Notre Dame is the highest-ranked team on USC’s 2024 schedule, relative to the preseason US LBM Coaches Poll. After the loss at the Fighting Irish last season, USC is looking for major revenge in a game that could decide the outcome of its season.\n Marcus Freeman’s Irish are coming off a 10-3 season and a No. 14 final ranking in 2023. They face Texas A&M to open the season.\n3. Michigan Wolverines\nTroy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Michigan Wolverines come in at No. 8 in the preseason poll. The Wolverines have 944 points and received one first-place vote.\nThere are four Big Ten teams ranked inside the top 10 of the US LBM Coaches Poll heading into the 2024 season. Two teams in the conference are ranked inside the top five. There are six Big Ten teams ranked in the top 25 to start the year.\nThe defending national champs are coming off a 15-0 season but lost J.J. McCarthy, Blake Corum and head coach Jim Harbaugh.\nMichigan hosts the USC Trojans in the “Big House” on September 21 in a game where we will find out a lot about both teams.\n4. LSU Tigers\nMatthew Dobbins-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Trojans open this season against the LSU Tigers on Sept. 1 inside Allegiant Stadium in the Vegas Kickoff Classic. This is one of the most highly anticapted games of the season.\nBrian Kelly is entering his third season as LSU’s coach. He is looking to be an SEC and national championship contender; it starts in Vegas. Kelly will have to replace three first-round picks in Malik Nabers, Jayden Daniels, and Brian Thomas Jr.\n5. Ohio State Buckeyes\nUSA TODAY Sports Syndication — Columbus Dispatch\nThe Ohio State Buckeyes are the No.1 team in the nation. Though they do not play USC in the regular season schedule, Ohio State is still a huge threat to the Trojans in the conference and national landscapes.\nThey could meet either in the Big Ten Championship Game or the the 12-team CFB Playoff. Either way, Ohio State is expected to set the standard in the conference for football in 2024.",

    "text": "DUISBURG (dpa-AFX) - Employees of Thyssenkrupp's steel division protested against the planned job cuts with wooden crosses, grave lights and torches in front of the steel headquarters in Duisburg on Thursday evening. According to the works council, around 200 people took part in the 30-minute \"visual guerrilla action\". Four men dressed in black carried a coffin with a doll inside. Bengal flares and smoking pots were also lit.\n\"Setting an example\"\nThe employees wanted to demonstrate for the future of the steel division with the action, explained the works council. On the eve of an important Supervisory Board meeting, they wanted to \"set an example\", said Jens Burnicki from the General Works Council.\nThe Supervisory Board of Germany's largest steel producer Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe (TKSE) will discuss a fundamental realignment on Friday. In order to become more competitive, a reduction in production capacity is planned, which will also involve job cuts. However, redundancies for operational reasons are to be ruled out. The division is about to become independent. However, the financial resources that the parent company will use to make the steel division independent are still in dispute.\nWorks Council sees danger of insolvency\nThe Chairman of the Works Council at the Duisburg/Beeckerwerth site, Ali Güzel, expressed concern on Thursday evening that the parent company is not providing enough money. \"The fear is that we will be given as little dowry as possible, so that at the end of the day the insolvency administrator will be at the door,\" Güzel told journalists. \"The risk of insolvency is very high,\" he continued.\nAccording to him, the commissioning of a further expert opinion on the necessary financial resources of the division is also on the agenda of the supervisors on Friday. The previous ideas of the steel management, the thyssenkrupp Executive Board and co-determination were still too far apart. According to Güzel, the employee side will only agree to a business plan drawn up by the steel management once the future financing has been clarified.\nAround 27,000 people work in Thyssenkrupp's steel division, 13,000 of them in Duisburg./tob/DP/he\nShare Go to the original article .\nLegal disclaimer Legal disclaimer\nContact us to request a correction\nBack © dpa-AFX - 2024",

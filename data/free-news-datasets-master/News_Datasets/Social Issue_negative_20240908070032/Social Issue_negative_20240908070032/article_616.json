    "text": "Ashley Jones, Bariki ‘Bar’ Smith\n‘Teen Mom’ Star Ashley Jones’ Estranged Husband, Bariki ‘Bar’ Smith, Held Her Hostage & Threatened To Break Her Jaw Before Arrest Scary details have surfaced on Bariki “Bar” Smith’s recent arrest.\nAs previously reported, in July news broke that the MTV reality TV dad was arrested in Henderson, Nevada on second-degree kidnapping, coercion with threat of or use of physical force, contempt of municipal court, and harassment charges. At the time of the initial reports, full details on what occurred, including Bar Smith’s alleged victim, were limited. However, some speculated his estranged wife, Teen Mom: The Next Chapter star Ashley Jones , was on the receiving end of the 27-year-old’s attack.\nAshley Jones\nThe recently obtained police report has confirmed those whispers. The crazy incident reportedly started on July 6, after Ashley Jones , 27, posted a now-removed picture of herself with her new boyfriend to her Instagram Story. It’s said that an enraged Bar Smith contacted the mother of his 7-year-old daughter and warned her he was making the drive across state lines from California to her Nevada home.\nThe following day, before walking into her apartment, she reportedly called her mother over concerns her ex broke in. Her mom shared with authorities that while on the phone with her daughter she heard a man’s voice in the background say, “Hello, baby momma” before the call disconnected.\nAshley Jones and her mom\nHer mother immediately called 911 and made her way to Ashley Jones’ home. Per the police report, once officers were able to get Ashley safely to the front door she was “scared,” “crying, shaking, and very emotional.”\nReportedly, Bar has been “harassing and stalking Ashley for years.” After he was arrested she shared with police that he was “waiting for her on her couch,” and quickly took “her phone [and] all her electronics.” She also said he barricaded the doors using two kitchen barstools and said, “If you’re not leaving with me, you’re not leaving, period.”\nBariki ‘Bar’ Smith\nAllegedly, he claimed he’d give the items back only if she would take him to her boyfriend’s house. When she refused he reportedly told her,\n“Say something again, and I will break your f***ing jaw.”\nA threat Ashley believed “due to [Bar’s] violent past with her.”\nBar is currently behind bars on a $35,000 bail. Ashley officially filed for divorce on August 1, noting Bar’s recent attack against her in the filing. She requested sole custody of their daughter.\nAshley Jones, Bariki ‘Bar’ Smith, and their daughter\nWhat are your thoughts on this entire situation? Tell us in the comments below!\n[ VIA ]",

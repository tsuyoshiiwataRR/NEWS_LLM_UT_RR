    "text": "Africa CDC in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia – is a promising way for countries to domestically invest in strengthening their health systems. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) plans to declare mpox a public health emergency of continental concern next week, marking the first such declaration in the agency’s history.\nThe decision follows a surge in mpox cases across Africa in 2024, matching 2023’s total in just six months. Since January 2022, over 38,000 cases and 1,456 deaths have been reported. This year, 10 African Union states have recorded more than 14,000 cases and 450 deaths, with 2,750 confirmed — 160% higher than the same period in 2023.\nRecent outbreaks in Ivory Coast, Kenya and Uganda highlight the virus’s expanding reach. Mpox infections in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda are the first on record in these countries.\nA new variant of the mpox virus, known as clade 1b, is fueling the outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that has spread to neighboring countries. The DRC, where mpox was first detected in 1970 and remains endemic, bears the brunt of this outbreak, accounting for more than 96% of both cases and deaths.\nJean Kaseya, director of Africa CDC, announced the impending declaration Thursday, emphasizing its significance in controlling the outbreak and mobilizing resources. The declaration is expected to boost African production of diagnostic tools and ease import restrictions on medical supplies.\n“This declaration will increase coordination between Africa CDC and member states,” Kaseya said, adding it would accelerate research and development of diagnostics and vaccines.\nThe move coincides with the World Health Organization considering a similar global declaration. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday an emergency committee would be convened “as soon as possible” to advise on whether the outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.\n“In light of the spread of mpox outside DRC and the potential for further international spread within and outside Africa, I have decided to convene an emergency committee under the International Health Regulations,” Tedros said at a press briefing in Geneva.\nThis is a developing story.\nImage Credits: Africa CDC .",

    "text": "Former President John Dramani Mahama has urged President Nana Akufo-Addo and Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia to undergo the same level of scrutiny that he faced during the Airbus scandal investigations.\nThis follows the Special Prosecutor’s investigation clearing him of any wrongdoing in the case.\nIn a press statement issued on Thursday, August 8, Mr Mahama expressed his satisfaction with the investigation’s outcome, stating that it has vindicated him from the unfounded accusations levelled against him.\nHe emphasised the importance of transparency and accountability for all public officials, regardless of their rank, and challenged the current administration to demonstrate its commitment to these values.\nMr Mahama criticised the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) for allegedly using the Airbus scandal as a tool to tarnish his reputation for political gain.\nHe argued that the truth has ultimately prevailed and urged the government to focus on addressing the country’s pressing issues rather than engaging in smear campaigns.\nRead also: OSP found no evidence of corruption against Mahama in Airbus bribery scandal The former president also called on President Akufo-Addo and Vice President Bawumia to subject their own conduct while in office to similar investigations.\nHe suggested that such transparency would reflect their dedication to combating corruption and would help build public trust in their leadership.\nVice President Bawumia and President Akufo-Addo “President Mahama has always made himself available for any investigation. He has consistently stated that he has nothing to hide and has been ready to cooperate fully with any inquiry.”\n“In this spirit, we extend the same challenge to Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia and President Akufo-Addo to subject themselves to equal scrutiny and transparency as we strive for accountability in our leadership,” the statement said.\nIn 2020, former Special Prosecutor Martin Amidu identified former President John Dramani Mahama as the mysterious ‘Government Official 1’ in the Airbus scandal involving the procurement of aircraft for the Government of Ghana.\nAlthough Mr Mahama denied the accusation, members of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) continued to insist on his involvement in the bribery scandal.\nHowever, during a press conference on Thursday, August 8, the Special Prosecutor Kissi Agyebeng stated that his office, after a thorough investigation, found “no evidence” of corruption against the former President.\nMr Agyebeng further clarified that the processes leading to the purchase of the military aircraft adhered to all necessary procurement standards.",

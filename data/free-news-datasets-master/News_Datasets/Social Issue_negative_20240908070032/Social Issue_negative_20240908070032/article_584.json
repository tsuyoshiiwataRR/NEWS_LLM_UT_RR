    "text": "English Español FOX 2 Detroit reporter on JD Vance’s aggressive answer: “I didn’t think that was a bogus question!” JD Vance came off particularly unhinged at a Michigan campaign stop yesterday, where he gave “icy responses” to even the most softball questions like “what makes you smile” — acting hostile and calling the reporter’s question “bogus.” John James’ spin after this embarrassing showing? Blame the media! Answering why he believes the race is “so close,” James bizarrely attempted to claim that “the stories people have been getting from the media have, frankly, been slanted.” According to James, it’s “slanted” to report on topics like JD Vance’s deep connections to Project 2025, his recent bizarre and sexist comments denigrating women, or the prolific history of anti-choice extremism Vance has recently attempted to cover up. It’s also apparently “slanted” to highlight James’ own support for banning abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest, his plan to gut Social Security and Medicare, or his laundry list of dark money donors. John James owes Michiganders answers: why is it “slanted” to report MAGA extremists’ very own words and actions? DCCC Spokesperson Aidan Johnson: “Michiganders got up close and personal with JD Vance’s utter lack of charisma yesterday, watching him proudly display his gross extremism as he lashed out at voters and the media alike. John James is happily hitching his wagon to Vance’s disaster, and with fundamentally the same far-right agenda and self-serving beliefs as Vance, there’s no way for James to hide from voters this November.” ### Share on Facebook Share via Email",

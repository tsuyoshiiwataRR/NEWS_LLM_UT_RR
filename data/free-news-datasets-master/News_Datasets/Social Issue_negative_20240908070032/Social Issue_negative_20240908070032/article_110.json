    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Two women who say they were sexually harassed by former chief deputy mayor Thomas Cook [ have sent a letter](https://interactive.wthr.com/pdfs/SexualHarresmentLetterHogsettOsili.pdf) to Mayor Joe Hogsett and City-County Council President Vop Osili. 13News obtained a copy of the letter. It reads in part: \"We write today to continue our urgent calls for transparency, accountability, and bold action from the City of Indianapolis to implement stronger sexual harassment and abuse prevention policies, an independent reporting system, and comprehensive support services for survivors.\" - The women also outlined four steps they want the city to take to prevent future abuse: - Hire third-party experts to audit and study the scale of the problem - Train and educate all employees, not just management, on workplace rights. - Provide an independent, third-party for survivors to report to. - Extend no-cost mental health services to survivors. Here is the full letter the women sent: On Aug. 7, Democratic Councilor Jesse Brown (D-13) shared a statement calling for Mayor Joe Hogsett (D-Indianapolis) to step down. Brown cites allegations of predatory behavior by Hogsett's [former chief deputy mayor, Thomas Cook](https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/mayor-hogsett-announces-changes-to-cabinet-in-2021/531-ac0ad2b5-af30-4acd-a70d-50916c858b04). \"Any reasonable public official would recognize his culpability in these abuses,\" said Brown [in a statement posted online](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pygpQnOPKzRsS-rzmGsK8nhi2F-wz53y30jxYtjSo8w/edit). \"Any good public official would make sure that such abuses never, ever reoccurred.\" Brown says Hogsett has resisted calls for answers from city-county councilors. \"When councilors demanded a meeting with Hogsett to have their questions answered, only Hogsett attorneys and a silent, junior staffer attended the call,\" wrote Brown. Brown said Hogsett has failed to make sure something like the allegations doesn't happen again. \"Even now, weeks after news of Cook’s pattern of predation broke publicly, Hogsett has not implemented a clear and confidential process for reporting sexual harassment, nor has he provided sexual harassment training for all City employees,\" said Brown. 13News has received a copy of a letter that went out to all city-county employees on Aug. 5. It reads in part \"sexual harassment training is mandatory for all city and county elected officials, councilors and supervisory-level employees of the city and county government.\" The letter said that arrangements were being made for this mandatory training. It went on to say \"any employee who becomes aware of an incident of harassment, whether by experiencing the incident, witnessing the incident, or being told of it should report that incident to their immediate supervisor or any representative of management.\" On Aug. 8 Hogsett said \"every time a complaint was made, it was handed over to my legal team. It was fully investigated. Sanctions were leveled. He no longer works for me.\" Hogsett also said he complied with the sexual harassment law passed in 2019. The allegations of predatory behavior against Cook were revealed in reporting by the [IndyStar](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2024/07/19/indianapolis-mayor-hogsett-aide-thomas-cook-accused-sexual-harassment/74444929007/) and [Mirror Indy](https://mirrorindy.org/indianapolis-mayor-joe-hogsett-thomas-cook-aide-sexual-harassment/). (Note: You can read more on the allegations in the before linked stories.) When the story first broke, Hogsett [posted a response on X](https://x.com/IndyMayorJoe/status/1814360034773741989), formerly known as Twitter. The posts read in part: \"Sexual harassment reporting protocols were updated as recently as 2023. This Administration remains committed to protecting the safety and wellbeing of every employee, and we will always seek ways to improve our policies and best practices.\" Brown declined an interview, saying he wanted to give the administration and fellow councilors a chance to respond before speaking to the press. Just before 1 p.m. on Thursday, the Republican caucus of the City-County Council announced they wanted an investigative committee to look into the allegations. They said they would introduce a resolution with Democratic councilors at the council's meeting on Aug. 12. They released a statement that said in part \"the fact that multiple women came forward over the years only to have their serious allegations about a senior administration official ignored is disturbing and need to be properly addressed.\" The statement went on to say \"in order to properly restore the trust in our executive branch, we must have an outside body thoroughly investigate these and any other allegations that may exist.",

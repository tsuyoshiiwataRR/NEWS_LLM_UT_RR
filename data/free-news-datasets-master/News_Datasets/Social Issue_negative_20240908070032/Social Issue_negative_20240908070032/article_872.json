    "text": "Since President William Ruto announced that he would form a broad-based government, part of the opposition has warmed up to his administration. Then time came for the President to name his Cabinet and there was a split in the opposition, with some supporting the idea of having its members included while others said they were not interested. The matter was even the subject of discussion in Parliament, with some members of ODM saying Article 232 of the Constitution should be evoked in all appointments. The article is about the values and principles of public service which include high standards of professional ethics, efficient, effective and economic use of resources; responsive, prompt, effective, impartial and equitable, involvement of the people in the process of policymaking and transparency and provision to the public of timely, accurate information. The President took the next step and named his second batch of Cabinet Secretaries including four top ODM leaders, a move that saw some of his harshest critics join his administration. Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma has emerged as one of the ODM legislators who support Ruto’s move. “History is made as John Mbadi becomes the first Luo to be appointed Minister of State in charge of the Treasury! Congratulations my brother. May God go ahead of you as you serve our motherland,” said Kaluma after the Cabinet Secretaries were sworn in yesterday. On Wednesday in Parliament, Kaluma said the President not only ensured ethnic and regional balance but also included minorities. Besides the National Treasury, ODM also got the Energy and Cooperative development dockets, the latter of which is in charge of Hustler Fund, Ruto's pet project. The docket went to former Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. The Energy ministry went to ODM stalwart Opiyo Wandayi. Former Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, who has been one of the two ODM deputy leaders, is the new Mining CS. “Before the nomination of the last batch of nominees, I spoke passionately about the need for appointing authority to always comply with provisions of Article 232. When I spoke so, I did not know who the President had under consideration. I was speaking because when you come from Homa Bay across Migori to Nyamira and Kisii we had only one CS in Ezekiel Machogu, former Education CS and one Principal Secretary, Raymond Omollo for whom we had thanked the President,” Kaluma said. Even before ODM warmed up to Ruto, Kisumu Senator Tom Ojienda openly supported the government, which put him at loggerheads with party leaders. Ojienda is now calling on Kenyans to give the President a chance to deliver. “A message to Kenyans let us give the government an opportunity to deal with those issues that led to a near collapse of government, to deliver on the promises of economic growth, inclusivity an give broad based government chance to deliver to the people,” Ojienda said yesterday.

Apart from the Gen Z issue, there was the question of representation of other political formations in Government. As he ensured that Kenyans are part of Government, he gave an olive branch to Azimio and has brought in four new faces,” Ojienda said in an interview. ODM leaders in Nairobi, led by Makadara MP George Aladwa joined the calls for youth to call off anti-government protests. They said that the President had demonstrated goodwill and is ready to change. “If the country is destroyed, we will all lose. Even those in leadership positions will not have anywhere to run to. Gen Zs, you have been heard and the leadership will continue to listen to you,” Aladwa said. Aladwa also lauded ODM leader Raila Odinga for agreeing to work with Ruto, even as he dismissed claims that the ODM Cabinet members went against the party by joining the government. “We cannot solve the challenges facing the country when we take to the streets on a daily basis. Many people have lost their livelihoods and lives, which as a country should not be allowed to continue,” the leaders added. Yesterday, a Kisumu businessman said residents were no longer interested in protests that have been happening in the country because \"they are now part of the government\". According to the businessman, they will not be part of demonstrations because ‘they are now in Government’ by virtue of the now former ODM MPs being part of the Cabinet and thanked President Ruto and Raila for making this to happen. “Business is running as usual. We do not want to be involved in demonstrations anymore because we are now in government. We thank the President because he gave us four Cabinet slots. We do not want violence, we want peace in the country,” said the businessman.",

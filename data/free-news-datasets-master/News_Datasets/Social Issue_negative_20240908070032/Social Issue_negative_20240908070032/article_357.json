    "text": "WASHINGTON (7News) — A D.C. official resigned after she was caught working a second full-time job, a Washington Post article revealed. Caroline Lian worked for the District’s Department of Buildings for almost two years. She was hired as Chief Operations Officer in 2022 and promoted to Deputy Director in 2023. A report from the District of Columbia’s Board of Ethics and Government Accountability Office revealed she was working full-time with Freddie Mac where she made six figures. The report detailed how Lian had a hybrid schedule for both jobs which allowed her to work from home or in the office on different days of the week. READ MORE | Dozens of DC Circulator employees protest at Franklin Park ahead of mass layoffs Lian was elected as a Falls Church City Council Member in January 2022 and resigned from her position effective August 8, city officials said in a statement. “Upon review, the City discovered that the former council member listed only Freddie Mac as her employer and did not disclose her employment relationship with the District of Columbia,” said Mary Catherine Chase, spokesperson for the City of Falls Church. Lian has agreed to pay a $25,000 fine to the city for violating its code of ethics. Falls Church officials said they reported the incident to the Commonwealth’s Attorney for investigation.",

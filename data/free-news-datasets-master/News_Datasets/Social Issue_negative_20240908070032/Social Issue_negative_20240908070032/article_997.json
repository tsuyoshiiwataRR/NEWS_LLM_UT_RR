    "text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) yesterday sent a Health Alert Network (HAN) update to clinicians, urging them to remain on alert for mpox in people who have recently visited the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) or any of eight border countries, some of which have reported recent cases linked to an ongoing large outbreak in the DRC. The HAN update, the first since December 2023, came the same day the World Health Organization (WHO) [announced](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/who-convene-emergency-committee-weigh-mpox-spread-africa) plans to convene an emergency committee to assess if outbreaks in Africa, some involving a novel clade 1 virus, warrant a public health emergency of international concern. So far, no infections involving clade 1 have been reported outside eastern and central Africa, the CDC said. However, due to the risk of additional spread, clinicians should have a heightened index of suspicion for people who have been in the region, and present with rash and other symptoms, such as fever, chills, and fatigue. Clade 1 is endemic in parts of Africa and is different than the clade 2 virus circulating globally, primarily in men who have sex with men. Risk of imported cases remains very low The CDC said the risk of imported clade 1 mpox cases in very low, due to a limited number of direct commercial flights to the United States from the DRC and neighboring countries. It added that the United States has robust mpox testing capacity, including clade-specific methods, and that the CDC continues to sequence a subset of samples to look for mutations. Also, the group said to provide early warning it continues to support community wastewater testing for both clades, including sites around select airports.",

    "text": "Media Center Egypt condemns Israeli Finance Minister's statements, stresses that security of Palestinians are the responsibility of the occupying state Thursday، 08 August 2024 - 06:16 PM Egypt condemns the statements made by the Israeli Finance Minister and emphasizes that the security of Palestinians is the responsibility of the occupying state. In a statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday, August 8, 2024, Egypt denounced the Israeli Finance Minister's claim that there is a moral justification for starving Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip. Egypt considers such shameful statements to be unacceptable both in form and substance, representing a clear violation of international humanitarian law and the four Geneva Conventions. These laws impose an obligation on Israel, as the occupying power, to ensure a safe life and provide basic living necessities for the Palestinian people under occupation. Furthermore, Egypt views these irresponsible statements as incitement against the residents of the Gaza Strip and an ongoing evasion of the interim measures demanded by the International Court of Justice regarding Israel. Egypt reminds all parties in the international community that the foundations of international humanitarian law have been developed over the past decades to combat and prevent practices that violate human dignity. It calls for an effective international effort to address the tragedies faced by civilians in the Gaza Strip, ensuring the preservation of minimum legal and moral standards in times of conflict.

    "text": "HOUMA, La. — A man was arrested for drunk driving after he slammed into a state police unit and injured a Trooper, according to the Louisiana State Police. Deak Matteson Jr., 63, of Guin, AL was arrested on Wednesday following the crash on LA Hwy 24. State police said Matteson was driving a 2004 Ford F-150 going south in the northbound lanes. When a State Trooper saw he was going the wrong way, they tried to stop Matteson using their emergency sirens and lights. Matteson failed to stop and \"struck the State Police unit head-on,\" a release said. The Trooper suffered minor injuries from the accident, was taken to a hospital, and released. Troopers said Matteson was impaired and gave a breath sample that showed his blood alcohol level was over the legal limit. He was booked into the Terrebonne Parish Jail on a DWI first offense, vehicular negligent injuring, one-way roadways, and a driver must be licensed charge. ► Get breaking news from your neighborhood delivered directly to you by downloading the new FREE WWL-TV News app now in the [IOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/new-orleans-news-from-wwl/id1453203460) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_d6bcd10196773d6203b7e9b10e53fea3&hl=en_US&pli=1).",

    "text": "A recent study showed a significant decline in the navigability of the Northwest Passage, Arctic Archipelago due to obstructions caused by multilayer ice in the region.\nA new study published in Communications Earth & Environment revealed that the Northwest Passage, which connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans through Arctic waters, has experienced a significant reduction in navigability in recent years. This reduction is mainly attributed to the southward drift of multiyear ice, obstructing key shipping routes.\nSince the first recorded transit of the Northwest Passage in 1906, fewer than 400 voyages have successfully navigated these waters. Despite the challenges posed by unpredictable ice and weather conditions, the passage has remained an attractive option because of the significant distance it can save on shipping journeys between the two oceans.\nHowever, according to an analysis of satellite data from 2007 to 2021, the shipping season in the Northwest Passage has been shrinking. This occurs despite a general decline in sea ice thickness and extent across the Arctic, which is often believed to make the passage more viable during the summer months.\nThe map shows all ship tracks 1990–2018 (grey lines), and shipping routes (four different line colours) along the Northwest Passage (NWP).

Credit: Nature/Authors On July 13, 2024, NASA’s PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, Ocean Ecosystem) satellite captured a mostly cloud-free image of the Northwest Passage. The image showed that ice was obstructing all shipping routes around Victoria Island.\nAccording to Walt Meier, a sea ice scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), despite the Arctic sea ice extent ranking seventh-lowest in the satellite record for mid-July, the ice coverage around the Canadian archipelago remains near record-low levels for this time of year. While the southern route around Victoria Island is expected to clear by late September, conditions in the channels could change depending on wind patterns and drifting ice, Meier added.\nThe study identified the movement of multiyear ice from higher-latitude regions as a key factor in maintaining “choke points” along certain sections of the passage. This older, thicker ice is more resilient to atmospheric and oceanic changes, making it a persistent barrier in the channels.\nDespite the overall decline in Arctic sea ice thickness and extent, the presence of this multiyear ice in the northern Canadian islands and Greenland continues to obstruct shipping routes.\nAn analysis of 40 years of satellite data shows a long-term decline in Arctic sea ice, with older, more durable ice becoming increasingly rare.\nAccording to NOAA’s 2023 Arctic Report, ice older than four years covered nearly 2.5 million km 2 (965 255 mi 2 ) in September 1985. By September 2023, that coverage had dwindled to less than 100 000 km 2 (38 610 mi 2 ).\nThe Northwest Passage remained largely ice-covered in the past, blocking the inflow of Arctic Ocean ice. However, as the channels have melted in recent years, thick, hazardous ice has increasingly infiltrated the passage, posing new challenges for navigation, according to Meier.\nReferences:\n1 Sea ice choke points reduce the length of the shipping season in the Northwest Passage – Cook, A.J., Dawson, J., Howell, S.E.L., et al. – Commun Earth Environ 5 , 362 (2024) – https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01477-6 – OPEN ACCESS\n2 Sea Ice Chokes the Northwest Passage – NASA/EO – Accessed on August 8, 2024\nFeatured image credit: NASA/EO",

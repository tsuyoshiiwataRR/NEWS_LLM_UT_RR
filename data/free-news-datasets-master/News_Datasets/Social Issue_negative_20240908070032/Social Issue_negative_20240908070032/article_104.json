    "text": "CROWN POINT — A Lake Criminal Court judge compared a 62-year-old man's sexual assault on a woman with an intellectual disability to a child molesting during the man's sentencing hearing Thursday morning. \"He took a woman that had the mental capacity of a ten to 12 year old, groomed her and had sex with her,\" Judge Samuel Cappas said. \"She was not capable of understanding what was going on at the time.\" Danny L. Allen Sr., of Gary, pleaded guilty to sexual battery and criminal confinement for having sex with the woman whom he met through work at a Hobart restaurant. The woman was 19-years-old at the time, according to testimony from her mother, and had a low IQ. She was not fully aware of what was happening due to her disability, her mother said. Allen was sentenced to 7-and-a-half years in prison for the crimes, all suspended and to be served on sex offender probation. Both the prosecution and defense agreed on this term because of Allen's age and lack of criminal history. People are also reading… Deputy Prosecutor Jessica Arnold said if Allen makes a mistake while on probation, he will serve the remainder of the term in prison. Defense attorney Patrick Young said he doesn't believe Allen intended to harm the woman. \"The defendant now understands what he did was wrong and against the law,\" Young said. \"Now he understands?\" Cappas asked. Allen apologized to the woman and her mother in court for any pain he caused. \"I admit that I was wrong,\" he said. The victim's mother told the court her daughter met Allen on her first day of work in August 2020. She said she remembers going to pick her daughter up from work and seeing Allen with his arm around her shoulder. He introduced himself and told the woman's mother that if the woman ever was concerned about her daughter at work to call him. She said she remembered her daughter's bubbly personality changing over time—she became more withdrawn and would go straight to her room after work. \"She was no longer happy, no longer smiling,\" the woman's mother said. After the woman started crying more frequently, her mother probed further about what might have happened. The victim eventually disclosed that Allen had assaulted her but she didn't want to get him in trouble. \"Just because someone is 18 doesn't give [the defendant] the right to take advantage of anyone,\" the woman's mother said. \"Especially [someone] with special needs.\" The girl herself said she initially trusted Allen when they became friends, but then things took an uncomfortable turn. \"Danny would make me do things I didn't want to do ... when I would go home, I would try not to think about it.\" She told Cappas she remembers feeling intense anxiety throughout this time in her life. She said she is in therapy to work on healing and improving her self-esteem. She said Allen used to like her hair long, so she cut it short. \"I am learning to love myself again,\" she said.

    "text": "A driver in Colorado was recently busted while allegedly traveling at a notably excessive speed of 126 miles per hour. Regardless of where someone is at in the state, this is obviously far above the posted speed limit. The incident was covered in a [release](https://www.facebook.com/ThorntonPD/) from the Thornton Police Department on August 7, with a simple statement: \"126 MPH is definitely dangerous, even for the highway.\" Further coverage from [KDVR](https://kdvr.com/news/local/thornton-pd-warn-of-court-summons-towing-after-driver-caught-at-126-mph/) noted that the driver was caught on I-25 and that the person was cited for speeding more than 40 miles per hour over the posted limit, as well as for careless driving with a mandatory court appearance. Of the [720 traffic fatalities](https://www.codot.gov/safety/traffic-safety/data-analysis/fatal-crash-data) that took place in Colorado in 2023, [excessive speed was the leading factor](https://www.codot.gov/news/2024/july/speeding-top-cause-fatal-crashes-colorado-2023) in those deaths, involved in 258 fatalities through the end of the year and above both impaired driving fatalities (228) and unrestrained passenger fatalities (222).",

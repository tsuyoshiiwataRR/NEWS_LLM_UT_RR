    "text": "State water quality officials advise the public to avoid swimming in North Carolina coastal waters from the Wright Memorial Bridge in Kitty Hawk to the South Carolina line due to heavy rain accompanying Tropical Storm Debby.\nThe N.C. Department of Environmental Quality said testing will begin as soon as conditions are safe. The advisory will remain in effect until results are available.\n“Since the impacts are widespread, it is not possible to post signs in all areas,” the agency said in a release.\nRecreational water quality officials sample 215 sites throughout the coastal region, most on a weekly basis, from April to October.\nStormwater runoff can contain harmful bacteria as it drains into coastal water bodies, the release said.\n“The excess rain has caused flooding of streets, yards and housing that have resulted in some municipalities having to pump flood waters into the ocean and sounds,” the release said. “Avoid swimming near ocean outfalls, including the wet sand where the floodwater is pumped, even if no sign is posted.”\nAt Cape Hatteras National Seashore, the National Park Service is advising visitors to stay out of the ocean at the north end of Rodanthe, near Corbina Drive, due to a compromised septic system.\n“Visitors to Rodanthe should avoid the beach between the north end of Rodanthe and South Shore Drive until conditions improve,” the release said.\nIn addition to potential bacteria, dangerous rip currents and rough seas are forecast for the weekend, prompting red “No Swimming” flags Thursday across the Outer Banks.",

    "text": "Many older adults live in mobile homes or RVs. But those can be deadly in Arizona's summer Summer heat is deadly, especially for those who are unhoused. But it can also be dangerous for those who do have housing. People living in mobile homes, trailers or RVs are likely to lack adequate cooling, yet many older adults reside in these kinds of dwellings. \"Yeah, they're definitely more affordable,\" said Dana Kennedy, state director of AARP Arizona. They also tend to be older, and the older the dwelling is, she says, the more likely they are to have problems in the extreme heat. \"But mobile homes just generally don't have the insulation that a home does. You know, sometimes they could be made with materials that may not help deflect the heat,\" Kennedy said. [Last year, nearly a quarter of indoor heat deaths were in mobile homes, trailers and RVs](https://www.maricopa.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/5820). \"It obviously has a huge impact on the elderly population. â€¦ And so we're trying to do everything possible to at least let people know that there are programs available to them. And they should reach out, you know, either to their energy provider, their utility provider or the city that they live in,\" Kennedy said.",

    "text": "Musk, amongst others, shared the false story At the most superficial level, glimpsed in a flash on social media, it looked like a legitimate Telegraph piece. “Keir Starmer considering building ‘emergency detainment camps’ on the Falkland Islands,” said the headline. Beneath it, the subheading read: “The camps would be used to detain prisoners from the ongoing riots as the British prison system is already at capacity.” The byline attributed the story to a real Telegraph employee. The fonts and formatting were accurate. There was even a plausible date stamp. But the story was utterly false. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has considered no such thing in response to the unrest that has swept Britain’s streets over the past week and a half. Nor has anyone at the Telegraph written anything of the kind. The first incidence of the fake image appears to have been on X, formerly known as Twitter, yesterday afternoon, at the end of the post from a user calling themselves L. Richardson, whose profile claims they are “challenging deceit with bold truths”. Their post was liked by 28 accounts, retweeted 14 times and attracted 22 comments. By Thursday lunchtime, it had gained 3,100 views. The misinformation was seemingly turbocharged when it was shared in the middle of the night by Ashlea Simon, the co-leader of the far-Right political party Britain First, who added the comment “we’re all being deported to the Falklands”, along with two laughing emojis, in a post at 1am. When she was asked where she had found it, she said Darren Grimes, a presenter at GB News. Grimes had reposted the fake headline, captioned with the comment “So we’ll send British protestors to the Falklands, but put up illegals in taxpayer-funded private accommodation and grant them amnesty? This man is a ****ing menace.” Grimes took down his post. “A journalist I follow shared it, and I assumed it was genuine given the trusted source,” he says. “I should have verified it through my Telegraph subscription before sharing. However, doesn’t this incident highlight the government’s erratic direction, making headlines seem plausible? I acknowledge my mistake and take full responsibility.” Darren Grimes, pictured leaving his court hearing over a fine by the Electoral Commission in 2019, also shared the false article - Jeff Gilbert But the fake story continued to spread. Elon Musk, the owner of X, reposted it, emphasising the phrase ‘detainment camps’. He has 193 million followers, nearly three times the population of the UK. Within 15 minutes, the image had been seen more than a million times. He took down his repost half an hour later, but not before the image had been seen more than two million times in total. What percentage of those viewers will have bothered to check whether the story was genuine? Legitimised by the Telegraph font and styling, the fake headline appears to speak to a martyr complex among many members of the far-Right, who routinely present themselves as the victims of political persecution. “It’s incredibly easy to fake a news article,” says James Ball, a fellow at the think-tank Demos and author of books including Post-Truth: how Bullshit Conquered the World. “By using the ‘inspect element’ function in your browser you can take any article and edit the text. All the fonts look proper. You screen-grab it and it looks like a real article. It’s a daily thing.” When readers see something that fits their prejudices, they are more likely to share it unthinkingly, he adds. “When you see anything that hits you emotionally or feels right politically, you react with your gut before you stop and think about it. However much you know about misinformation, if you see a headline that’s outrageous, but it looks real, you post it. “If you see a headline that doesn’t hit you emotionally or that you disagree with, you’re much more likely to [fact]-check it. That jolt of emotion, combined with the ease of acting, means it bypasses our critical thinking. We hit share before we have done anything. This is how normal people spread fake news.” Behaviour that might be forgivable in an innocent browser at home is less easy to understand in Musk, a tech tycoon considered by many, or at least many of his fans, to be highly intelligent. “It’s a bit of a mystery,” says Prof Charlie Beckett, the founding director of POLIS, the media think-tank at the London School of Economics. “Obviously Musk is a genius at things like electric cars, but I suspect either way he is a classic disinformation spreader in the sense that he has a particular worldview, and anything he sees that confirms it, he doesn’t even have to think about it. This is how most of us operate, to a degree, it’s just he is more extreme in his worldview and a lot more powerful in his ability to spread it. I don’t think he thinks about it. Anything he puts up will be seen by millions and millions of people.” Other social media sites have made concerted efforts to crack down on false images and information since the furore over the 2016 US presidential election, which saw considerable attention paid to fake news. Facebook now hires thousands of contractors to monitor posts for pornographic, fake or otherwise problematic content. Some believe that since Musk bought Twitter last year and renamed it X, the site’s algorithm has changed to give more weight to Right-wing opinions. “Facebook has created a safe environment,” Beckett says. “It has shown that if you want to get rid of hate speech and pornography, it is possible to do so. Twitter (X) has always been based on controversy and a range of views, but [Musk] clearly has changed the algorithm to favour more extreme views, especially Right-wing views, and suppress moderate views.” For Ball, the fake Falklands headline is proof that while much of the recent concern around social media has focussed on AI, disinformation and misinformation can be spread just as easily via old-fashioned, doctored photographs. “Big things about AI and deepfakes aren’t what you need to worry about,” he says. “People are more than happy with a screengrab or a video clip out of context.” Although a few million views are a drop in the ocean of the world’s attention, inflammatory posts add to a fraught atmosphere online, even without being amplified by the world’s richest man.

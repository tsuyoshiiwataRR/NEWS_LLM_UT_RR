    "text": "OPINION Comedians have had their fun with the downright disturbing confession from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about his dumping of a dead bear cub nearly a decade ago. It is impossible to grasp the rationale of his thought process, which would have difficulty attracting viewers if billed as a dark comedy on Netflix. It has grabbed people’s attention because it is outlandish to imagine someone deciding to do this or even consider doing this vile act. We have often heard that there are no bad ideas, but this was a bad idea. The entire story is reprehensible and disgusting. As a state legislator once nicknamed “The Bear” for my local advocacy, I have embraced that name to the core. It has allowed me to learn much about the bear population in our country and find a kinship with these majestic mammals, which compelled me to share my thoughts as someone who will always fight for the humane treatment of animals. To some, this story is a tremendous comedy material and will score plenty of laughs. Still, the thought process behind this incident has a variety of consequences that are far from funny, and Mr. Kennedy should be ashamed. Carol Murphy is the majority whip of the New Jersey State Assembly.",

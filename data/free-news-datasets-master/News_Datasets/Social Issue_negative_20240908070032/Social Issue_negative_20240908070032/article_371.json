    "text": "We have generated a rent roll; however the amount is incorrect, but is entered correctly.\nSounds like there may be a problem with a date. See if the information from this article helps:\nPM Generate Rent Roll charge is prorated incorrectly (sage.com)\nI am also having a similar issue. For me Sage is changing a single tenant a slightly higher amount in January. Every other month it is charging the correct amount. The other tenants at the same property do not have this issue, it is just the one tenant. Is there anything else I can look at to troubleshoot my issue? When I run a rent through through to next January I see the same issue appear again.\nI am also having a similar issue. For me Sage is changing a single tenant a slightly higher amount in January.

    "text": "Taylor Swift fans from around the world, who had swarmed to Vienna with friendship bracelets on their wrists and the pop star’s lyrics etched in their minds, were left heartbroken after an averted attack derailed their plans and cast her world tour’s future into uncertainty. “The happiest that we had ever seen her was when we told her last year that we got the tickets,” Hovington said. “And the saddest we have ever seen her was when we told her last night that the shows were canceled.” thank you lovely church in— kristi hovington (@kristihov) [#vienna]that played Taylor swift songs the day of the first cancelled concert and gave lots of sad swifties a place to gather. Thanks to the police for keeping us all safe! [#ViennaTStheErasTour] [pic.twitter.com/p9eZeIJaeT] [August 8, 2024] The Eras Tour — the highest-grossing concert tour in history — is scheduled to resume Aug. 15 with the first of five shows in London’s Wembley Stadium. The canceled shows in Vienna mark the biggest disruption to the tour since November, when a show in Rio de Janeiro was postponed following extremely hot temperatures that led to a fan’s death. The threat in Vienna came to light days after a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed yoga and dance class in the town of Southport in North West England, and coincides with a wave of terrorist threats against large events in Europe as well as mass shootings in the United States and other countries. Emily Best, a 40-year-old Swift fan from Brussels who had snagged tickets to all three Vienna shows, found herself wondering how she would explain what had happened to her 7-year-old son at home. “I think I would tell him that there are bad people who want to ruin things,” she said, and added: “They can’t see the beauty and joy of what the Eras Tour represents. It’s sickening.” Swift herself has admitted to having a fear of an attack at one of her shows. “I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months,” she told Elle Magazine in 2019, following the Manchester Arena attack and the Vegas concert shooting two years prior. “There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe.” Many Americans planned vacations to see Swift perform overseas, where the flight, hotel and ticket can cost less than admittance to once of her U.S. shows. [Skip to end of carousel](#end-react-aria-:R2frqdl76:) click here . Autumn Allen of Columbus, Ind., said she and a friend had bought some tickets to attend multiple shows at Wembley Stadium this month. But now they have decided to give the tickets to fans who couldn’t see the show in Vienna. Allen, who runs a Swift-related Facebook page, said news of the terrorist plot sent many into an “emotional spiral.” But she noted that fans stranded in Vienna didn’t stay despondent for long. A swath of videos and pictures posted to social media show Swifties singing in the city. Fans in Vienna gathered on Corneliusgasse, a small street close to Happel Stadium, to celebrate the 14-time Grammy winner. The street’s name echoes a song on Swift’s 2019 “Lover” album, “Cornelia Street.” “Our friends that were supposed to be attending a concert are dancing in the streets of Vienna; they are creating their art on sidewalks with chalk … and trading friendship bracelets,” she said. “Our friends in Vienna seem hopeful and unafraid.” As Hovington and her daughter walked through Vienna on Thursday, they discovered Esme’s birthday plans were not entirely ruined. On their way from the Austrian National Library to a shopping district, the teen heard Swift’s music being sung i n a church . They went in. “There were people in their Taylor Swift concert outfits … with their arms around each other, holding hands, taking pictures, taking videos,” Hovington said. “We sat through a couple of songs, just everybody was singing quietly. It wasn’t like at the concert — where people are screaming and dancing — it wasn’t like that. It was more of a somber, reflective, but really kind of cathartic moment. It was really beautiful, just completely unexpected.” “It was really sad,” Esme said. “But knowing that other people felt the same way I did … made me feel better.” - Old rivals Bill O’Reilly and Jon Stewart reunite to spar on ‘The Daily Show’July 17, 2024Old rivals Bill O’Reilly and Jon Stewart reunite to spar on ‘The Daily Show’July 17, 2024 - Just nowJust now - The 26 best things to do in D.C. this weekend and next week1 hour agoThe 26 best things to do in D.C. this weekend and next week1 hour ago",

    "text": "Venezuelan socialist regime strongman and long-suspected drug lord Diosdado Cabello claimed on Wednesday evening that YouTube awarded his television show Con el Mazo Dando (‚ÄúHitting with the Mallet‚Äù) a commemorative plaque for allegedly reaching 100,000 subscribers on its YouTube channel .\n‚ÄúThey sent me this plaque, get wrecked, escualidos! [‚Äòscrawny ones,‚Äô a slang term for the opposition],‚Äù Cabello said , claiming that YouTube administrators sent him a letter ‚Äúcongratulating [him] for the content and international reach of the channel.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe vermin cut [my channels] every time they can,‚Äù he continued.\nCabello ‚Äúpredicted‚Äù that the award would lead to the closure of his YouTube channel, claiming that long-time critics, such as Venezuelan journalist Alberto Ravell, would ‚Äúexert pressure‚Äù to such an end.\n‚ÄúNext week, they will knock down this channel. I guarantee it,‚Äù Cabello said. ‚ÄúYou will see because, here, the Ravells will get a hernia in because they have not even been thanked, and they were looking for me to give me the plaque.‚Äù\n#EnFotos üì∑| Primer Vicepresidente del PSUV, @dcabellor dio a conocer que recibi√≥ una Placa del equipo de YouTube, en reconocimiento al crecimiento continuo de su canal Con El Mazo Dando. #DesinstalaElOdio pic.twitter.com/pIiOVvYfq0\n‚Äî VTV CANAL 8 (@VTVcanal8) August 8, 2024\nCabello, a former member of the Venezuelan military, is widely known as one of the most powerful members of Venezuela‚Äôs authoritarian socialist regime, having occupied numerous high-ranking positions throughout the past 25 years. Cabello is presently the vice president of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) and one of the lawmakers of the National Assembly, which the Maduro regime seized control of from the Venezuelan opposition through a sham election held in December 2020.\nCabello was a close ally of late socialist dictator Hugo Ch√°vez and was one of the military officials who participated in Ch√°vez‚Äôs failed February 1992 coup attempt against the government of former President Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez.\nU.S. authorities have long accused Cabello of being one of the leading figures of the Cartel of the Suns, an intercontinental cocaine trafficking operation that high-ranking members of the Venezuelan military and some PSUV leading figures run.\nExperts have accused the Cartel of the Suns of engaging in ‚Äúasymmetric warfare‚Äù against the United States by trafficking cocaine into the U.S. The socialist drug cartel is believed to have forged alliances with the Shiite jihadist organization Hezbollah and other drug trafficking organizations, such as the Mexican Sinaloa Cartel, the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and the National Liberation Army (ELN) terrorist organization.\nThe Southern District of New York federal court indicted Cabello in March 2020 on charges of conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine, and associated firearms charges. Since then, U.S. authorities have enacted a still-active $10 million bounty for information that can lead to Cabello‚Äôs arrest and/or conviction. The Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Cabello and included him on its Specially Designated Nationals list in 2018.\nEl Mazo , Cabello‚Äôs weekly Wednesday evening show, was launched in February 2014 amidst a wave of protests against the Maduro regime that took place at the time.\nThe show is infamously known for featuring Cabello espousing insults and issuing intimidating threats against journalists, activists, dissidents, and critics of the ruling socialist regime ‚Äî including presidents and government officials of other countries. El Mazo is commonly recorded in front of an audience of socialists, military officials, and other ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù guests. Socialist dictator Nicol√°s Maduro is a recurring guest on the show.\n#VenezuelaSeRespeta\nRESUMEN DEL PROGRAMA CON EL MAZO DANDO #489 (07-08-24)\n¬°Revi√©ntense escu√°lidos! Youtube otorga placa de reconocimiento al canal de Con el Mazo Dando https://t.co/b9LaPpjZbp\nCabello: ¬°Nosotros lo advertimos! Edmundo Gonz√°lez es un asesino‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/tatr4MCBxm\n‚Äî Con el Mazo Dando (@ConElMazoDando) August 8, 2024\nCabello‚Äôs show is broadcast locally through state-owned television channels, such as Venezolana de Television and TVes, and online platforms, such as YouTube . Both Cabello and his show have extensive presences across several social media platforms .\nSeveral of the show‚Äôs past broadcasts have featured Cabello openly leaking private conversations between journalists or politicians that the socialist regime‚Äôs intelligence apparatus obtained by breaching the privacy of its participants in violation of Venezuela‚Äôs own privacy laws.\nIn 2015, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) denounced Cabello and Con El Mazo Dando after the show revealed the names and exact locations of a group of people that had come before an IACHR hearing that took place at the time.\nGoogle states that the plaques distributed throughout YouTube‚Äôs Creator Awards program are the video platform‚Äôs way of ‚Äúrecognizing the extraordinary effort creators put into their growing channels and to build thriving communities, responsibly.‚Äù\nChristian K.

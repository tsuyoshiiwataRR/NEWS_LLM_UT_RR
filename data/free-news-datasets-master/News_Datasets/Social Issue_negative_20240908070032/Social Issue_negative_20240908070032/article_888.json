    "text": "The Gen Z protests also disrupted travel plans for students and teachers proceeding to and from the Kenya Music Festival in Eldoret. Schools’ principals had to adjust their travel plans to safeguard their students as well as give learners an opportunity to take part in the festival. Several Regional festival officials issued a travel advisory, urging school buses to avoid the risk of being caught in the demonstrations. Through their WhatsApp groups, the officials warned teachers against risking lives. “To guarantee learners’ and your own safety, it has been advised that teams intending to leave Eldoret for Nairobi in the morning should delay their departure slightly until the situation can be assessed and further guidance given,” one official communicated. Teams leaving Nairobi for Eldoret were advised to proceed with caution, ideally setting off early in the morning to beat the protests. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter Many schools took this advice, with students departing as early as 4:30 a.m. to navigate the roads before any disruptions could occur. “We are in Naivasha en route to Eldoret. Pray for us for journey mercies,” one teacher posted at 6 a.m. This precautionary measure deviates from the Ministry of Education’s usual guidelines, which typically restrict school bus travel. Festival officials closely monitored the situation throughout the day.",

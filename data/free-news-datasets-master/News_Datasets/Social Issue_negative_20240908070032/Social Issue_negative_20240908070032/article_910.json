    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — An investigative committee needs to be formed in order to look into sexual harassment claims, says the Indy GOP Republican Caucus.\nThomas Cook, former Indianapolis deputy mayor, has been accused by former Hogsett administration staffers Lauren Roberts, Caroline Ellert, and a third, anonymous woman of years of grooming, sexual assault and harassment. The accusations were revealed in investigative reports by the Indianapolis Star and Mirror Indy.\nThe Mirror Indy report revealed claims that Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett knew of Cook’s behavior for years but did not act upon it.\nIt’s that accusation plus the original reports about Cook that have Republican City-County Councilor and Minority Leader Brian Mowery saying it’s time for everyone to come together and find out what’s going on in city government, “we can actually have the power to subpoena people to come testify before us and we would be able to call on people and really get the full story.”\nMowery calls the accusations disturbing and disheartening and says neglecting this kind of behavior puts city employees at risk.\nFull interview with Councilor Mowery. Article continues below:\n“I think the city employees deserve the full story, and they deserve to know they’re safe when they come to work,” Mowery explains.\nMowery wants to see Democrats join the call for a committee during the full council’s meeting this Monday, August 12th. He says this cannot happen without bi-partisan support and he’s already heard from Democrat councilors who want to see a similar action taken.\nMowery did not fully support the idea of Mayor Hogsett resigning. He says that is a possible outcome but reinforced the importance of letting the mayor defend himself and “have his day in court.” Democrat councilor Jesse Brown was the first member of the city-county council to call for Mayor Hogsett, also a Democrat, to step down for what several people have called “inaction” and “neglect” on the part of the mayor.\nREAD ALSO: Lauren Roberts and Caroline Ellert have released a letter addressed to the city calling for systemic change in Indianapolis.\nAs for city employees, Brian Mowery says the door is open if you have concerns about sexual misconduct, “I know for sure that I can speak for my caucus that you’re always welcome to reach out to any one of us with your concerns. We are happy to take those concerns seriously and try to give you the best guidance and connect you with the right people to make sure your issue is handled in the appropriate manner.”\n-\nTony Katz Today 2nd Hr 8/2/24: Biden Boards Hostage Plane After Hostages Left, Harris Word Salad, Owl Ring Bearer, Dems Disenfranchise Their Voters\n-\nAndretti Global Looks to Expand To NASCAR, Still Pushing For Formula One\n-\nDonald Rainwater: My Plan Is That We Basically Eliminate Property Taxes\n-\nItalian Olympian Angela Carini Tearfully Quits After Intense Punch From Transgender Opponent\n-\nMike Braun's Property Tax Proposal Is A Nice Start But Does Not Address The Fundamental Problem With Property Taxes\n-\nRecent Study Claims Indiana Has the Second-Best Quality Roads In US\n-\nTony Katz: Kamala Harris Isn't Here Because She Cannot Show Her Base Of Radicals As Being Somebody Who's Willing To Sit Down With Netanyahu\n-\nIndiana University Student Drowns in Lake Tahoe",

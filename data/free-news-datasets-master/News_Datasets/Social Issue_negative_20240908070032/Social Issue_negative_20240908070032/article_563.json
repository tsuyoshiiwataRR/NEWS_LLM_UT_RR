    "text": "NCHC doctor sees uptick in patients experiencing psychosis after using THC and synthetic products WAUSAU, Wis. (WSAW) - Marathon County is researching a potential THC ordinance. While there are no immediate plans to present an ordinance proposal to the county board, doctors are speaking out about an alarming trend due to THC and synthetic products. One North Central Health Care doctor said he’s seen an uptick in patients experiencing psychosis. Often after taking THC and synthetic marijuana. The Wausau Fire Chief said it’s sometimes a mix of drugs or people just simply don’t know what they’re taking. “Trying to figure it out on the fly is a very challenging task,” said Wausau Fire Chief Jeremy Kopp. Figuring out what drugs a person took is crucial information in how to treat them. But first responders are often left guessing. “What we’re finding a lot of time is your younger folks that are experimenting for the first time and thinking they are doing one thing and not fully understanding what they are all doing and what’s all mixed in with what they may be trying,” said Fire Chief Kopp. Checking for vital signs and symptoms. Kopp said the presentation of a patient can always be different in how they handle things, whether it’s hallucinations or loss of consciousness. The Wausau Fire Department administered Narcan to 40 patients in 2023 and so far this year 17. That’s consistent with what some doctors are seeing. “Incidents have gone up over the last two years,” said Dr. Waqas Yasin, Psychiatrist at North Central Health Care. Meaning he’s seeing more frequent cases of psychosis after taking THC or synthetic products. “Especially in patients who are younger associated with this synthetic cannabinoid,” said Dr. Yasin. He says the majority of the patients experiencing this are between 15 and 25. “They start hearing things that aren’t there and then they start responding,” said Dr. Yasin. Dr. Yasin works in the inpatient psychiatric unit at North Central Health Care and he sees some of the most severe patients. “Sometimes it takes up to weeks and months for them to get back to baseline,” said Dr. Yasin. In other cases, it can look more subtle like impacting the ability to function in school, jobs, and family environment. Dr. Yasin said it makes it difficult to think or solve problems. He said how it impacts young minds is complicated, just like the chemical makeup of the products. Delta 8,9,10 are the psychoactive component in cannabis. Delta 9 is what is naturally in the cannabis plant. Delta 8 and 10 are altered in a lab to change the chemical makeup. Their lab-created versions still qualify as federally legal “hemp” under the 2018 Farm Bill so long as the starting point for the process was a hemp plant. That same bill defined hemp as a plant having less than 0.3% of Delta 9 THC and since it focuses specifically on Delta 9, Delta 8 and 10 are a gray area. There is also synthetic marijuana, often known as K2 or ‘Spice,’ which is illegal. With all these variations with different chemical makeups, it’s hard to know what you’re taking. “The package looks like and says one thing but what’s actually in the product is a whole another game,” said Chief Kopp. The FDA doesn’t regulate them. Dr. Yasin said they all can have a powerful impact on the brain. “[They] bind to receptors in the brain which alters the chemicals which affect our emotions, our sense of reality and reasoning,” said Dr. Yasin. Causing people to act out of their character and worry loved ones. “Although they are being sold and they are being marketed as they don’t have side effects and they are okay to use, that’s absolutely wrong,” said Dr. Yasin. “We want to get out there and we want to educate people and we want to be more proactive in dealing with it,” said Chief Kopp. Copyright 2024 WSAW.

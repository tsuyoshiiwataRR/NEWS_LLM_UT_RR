    "text": "\"Why Democrats don't invoke the 25th Amendment to remove him from office immediately.\" Franks speculates that \"Democrats do not really want Harris as president\" or that \"some actually think Biden is not mentally impaired.\" Look at the windfall of donations Harris received in one week to answer the question about Democrats wanting her as president. See that Biden is still mentally fit enough to free the Russian prisoners, make changes to the Supreme Court, work on immigration reform and inflation — issues Trump never accomplished. The concern is not Biden's present mental fitness. It is obvious age is taking a toll, so the concern is his condition in four years when he's 86 years old. Perhaps the Republicans should address the same issue with their candidate who is truly mentally unfit to be president a second time — lying, ranting and raving, confusion, non-sequiturs, unable to give a straight (and honest) answer ... and if he should legitimately and tragically win the election, he will be 82, older than Biden is now.

    "text": "Man admits to fatally stabbing woman during fight at St. Louis gas station ST. LOUIS, Mo. (First Alert 4) - A man admitted in a St. Louis court that he fatally stabbed a woman during a dispute at a gas station. Booker T. Boyd, 53, pleaded guilty Thursday to first-degree involuntary manslaughter in the Aug. 21, 2023, killing of Natalie Stepney. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. Charging documents state that surveillance video at the Gas Mart at 5745 Delmar Boulevard showed an argument between Boyd and Stepney near the front door of the business. During the argument, Boyd threw what appeared to be a sandwich at Stepney, after which Stepney hit Boyd with a garbage can lid. Stepney was then stabbed in the chest with a pocket knife. During the sentencing hearing, Boyd said he had seen Stepney but had barely spoken with her before the argument. He admitted their argument “got physical” and led to him stabbing her in the chest with a pocket knife. Copyright 2024 KMOV. All rights reserved.",

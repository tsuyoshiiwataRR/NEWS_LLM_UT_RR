    "text": "'I'm speaking': Harris response to pro-Palestinian protesters shows she's not open to criticism Although Democrats are divided on Israel-Palestine, many want to support the Harris-Walz ticket. Brushing off protestors makes that hard. Two weeks ago, I wrote about [the dangers of idolizing Kamala Harris](https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/07/25/kamala-harris-campaign-biden-support-criticism-censorship/74518606007/) and dismissing her critics following her bid for president. Harris is not a perfect presidential candidate. This is a truth many knew but were avoiding in the excitement of the new Democratic ticket. The honeymoon is over. At Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s, joint rally in Michigan on Wednesday, a group of pro-Palestine protesters began chanting “Kamala, Kamala, you can’t hide, we won’t vote for genocide,” while Harris spoke about freedoms Americans would lose under another Trump presidency. She [snapped at the protesters](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/07/harris-to-protesters-if-you-want-donald-trump-to-win-then-say-that/74714086007/), conflating their demonstration with wanting Trump to win the election. “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that otherwise, I'm speaking,” she told them. This response lacks critical thinking and is also wildly insensitive while having a rally in Michigan of all places, the state with the largest Arab American population by density. Democrats are divided on Israel-Palestine Michiganders and other pro-Palestine Democrats genuinely want to support Harris’s presidential campaign. Members of Michigan’s uncommitted movement, a grassroots effort, encouraged voters to withhold support for Biden during the primary election in February due to the Administration's policies on Israel and Palestine. The group held a press conference the same day as the Harris-Walz rally, and is asking for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an arms embargo on Israel. The uncommitted movement is withholding an endorsement for Harris until they learn more about her position. Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of the movement and a Democratic National Convention delegate [told the Detroit News](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2024/08/07/uncommitted-leaders-demand-kamala-harris-back-israel-weapons-embargo-to-get-presidential-endorsement/74699770007/), “I want to be there, right there with my fellow Democrats, with the energy as we're getting exciting updates about the president's vice presidential pick.\" But Alwaeih and others cannot do that if they know their vote will result in further atrocities in Gaza. That’s not an unreasonable ask. Beyond what is happening overseas, many have rightful concerns over the influence Israel, a foreign government, has over United States politics. On Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Cori Bush, D-Missouri, who has been openly critical of Israel, lost in the primary to her opponent Wesley Bell. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobbying group, [boasted their contribution to the loss](https://x.com/AIPAC/status/1821291980724556193) on X. AIPAC has been spending millions to push Bush and other critics of Israel out of Congress in order to replace them with pro-Israel Democrats, according to [reporting from The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/05/israel-house-election-cori-bush-aipac/). AIPAC’s influence over the United States government cannot be understated, with 194 members of the House and 22 members of the Senate receiving donations during the 2024 cycle according to [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/american-israel-public-affairs-cmte/recipients?id=D000046963), a nonprofit that tracks campaign finances and lobbying. President Biden [has been lauded](https://www.aipac.org/resources/president-biden-strengthens-us-israel-relationship-on-first-presidential-middle-east-trip) by AIPAC for his commitment to U.S.-Israeli relations. Harris must be receptive to criticism to win the election I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Harris needs to be receptive to criticism if she wishes to differentiate herself from the Biden administration and strengthen her chances of winning this election. Imprudently, she has yet to provide a solid policy agenda and mostly positioned herself as an alternative to Trump. Compromise and understanding can only serve to help her campaign. The Harris-Walz ticket is balancing on a very delicate unity that left-leaning and moderate Democrats have formed over the last few weeks. Every move from Harris and Walz is precarious and should be handled with the utmost care. Popping off at the mouth at pro-Palestine protesters in Michigan? Not the smartest move. There are inherent flaws to single-issue voting, and a lot is a lot at stake with this election − reproductive rights, health care and protections for transgender youth just to name just a few − but this is a red line I will never fault one for making. As we inch closer to election, she will find that it is an issue she will increasingly not be able to brush off like she did at Wednesday’s rally. If Harris continues this lack of willingness to take criticism it could be her downfall, and I would sincerely like to avoid that possibility.

    "text": "Officials warn of phone scam KANAWHA COUNTY, [W.Va](http://W.Va). (WSAZ) – The Kanawha County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office is warning of a new phone scam. Officials said there has been a spike in complaints regarding phone scams claiming to be from the prosecutor, law enforcement and court officials. The schemer claims to be calling about a missed court appearance from Kanawha County Judge Douglas. During these conversations or voicemail messages, the scammer claims that he is a deputy with the Kanawha County Sheriff’s Office and that Prosecutor Debra Rusnak has obtained a warrant for arrest that will be effectuated unless the target pays money to the caller. Law enforcement and court officials will never contact you via phone requesting payment of any kind. Officials say although these scammers can be convincing officials say do not send money or other forms payment without taking steps to verify the legitimacy. If you get a similar call, officials say hang up and call 911. Copyright 2024 WSAZ. All rights reserved.",

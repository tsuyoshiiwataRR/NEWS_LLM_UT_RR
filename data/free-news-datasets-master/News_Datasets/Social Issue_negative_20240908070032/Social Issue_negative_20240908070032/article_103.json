    "text": "The world, both online and offline, has long been dominated by cats. JD Vance made the mistake of messing with them. His repulsive “childless cat lady comments,” saw him scratched, mauled, clawed and meowed at. Not surprisingly, a clarification for his sexist, misogynist and deeply patriarchal comments was directed at cats, not women. “I’ve got nothing against cats,” he said.Instead of attacking JD Vance, Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign chose simply to quote him, setting the internet on fire with a host of explosive memes, editorials and videos, as cat lovers, childless women and Taylor Swift fans helped unravel the hollowness of JD Vance’s family values.In a Fox News interview a few years ago, Vance had said, “We’re effectively run in this country—via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs—by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. If you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5fCJqFywCQFamily mattersHate-mongering, by its very definition, does not lend itself to logic or fact-checking, a point proved by Vance. Besides the obvious fact that men judging women on their reproductive choices or using childlessness as an insult is vile and repugnant, the people he chose to attack include devoted parents. Harris has helped raise her husband Doug Emhoff’s children from his first marriage. “How can you be childless when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I?” Harris’s step-daughter Ella asked in an Instagram post.Emhoff’s former wife Kersten has also strongly defended Harris, and praised her for being a loving, nurturing and fiercely protective co-parent who is always present.In keeping with the Republican Party’s obsession with women’s reproductive rights, Vance’s childless cat lady slur was aimed at women in politics, and not men. America’s first president George Washington did not have biological children, but was a parent to his stepchildren, much like Harris. 112369534Inexplicably, the “childless cat lady” slur was followed by an attack on US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, a gay man raising twins with his husband Chasten. Buttigeig told CNN that Vance’s comments came at a time when he and Chasten had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in their adoption journey. “He couldn’t have known that, but maybe that’s why you shouldn’t be talking about other people’s children,” Buttigeig added.Defending her husband, Usha Vance said what he was trying to say was that it was really hard being a parent in America, and sometimes the country’s policies were designed to make it even harder. If that’s what she understood from her husband’s comments on childless cat ladies, her translation app may have a bug in it.This is not the first time that JD Vance has attacked the childless. He has called for higher taxes from those without children, and greater voting rights for those with children, policies that can best be described as unhinged. Vance himself grew up in a dysfunctional family, with a father who put him up for adoption at six and a mother who was a drug addict, married several times, dragged him from home to home, and once threatened to crash a car in which she was driving him. And yet, he believes that biological parents have a greater stake in the future of America, however dysfunctional their homes are, compared to those who provide a happy home for children who don’t carry their DNA. Vance’s own life contradicts his ideology, exposing the sheer hypocrisy of his family values. medium112369932Vance is supporting a presidential candidate accused of sexually assaulting women, cheating on his wives and making lewd comments about his daughter is further proof of the emptiness of conservative America’s belief in family.Instead of arguing with Vance’s absurd statements, the Kamala Harris campaign, in a stroke of sheer genius, dug out a video of his vitriolic childless cat lady speech, galvanising support for Harris, giving her campaign the perfect rallying cry. After all, nearly 22 million US women between 20 and 39 do not have children. Cat ladies have had Zoom calls to raise money for the Kamala Harris campaign. 'Childless Cat Ladies for Harris 2024' is a slogan that can be found on a range of merchandise from T-shirts to bumper stickers. Cat ladies are reminding Vance that they plan to vote in the American election. And they won’t be voting for him.Vance may find his comments hard to walk back on, given that he has a history of using “cat-lady” as an insult. He once tweeted against Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman, calling him a weird cat lady. The word “weird” is now being used as the Harris campaign’s adjective of choice to describe both Vance and Trump, an adjective the two men will have a hard time shaking off.",

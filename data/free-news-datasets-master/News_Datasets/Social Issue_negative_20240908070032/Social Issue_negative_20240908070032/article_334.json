    "text": "Local government has never been under more financial stress, according to Corangamite Shire chief executive officer David Rae.In the council's submission to the state government's Inquiry into Local Government funding and services, Mr Rae said the ability to fund and maintain services and infrastructure was becoming increasingly difficult.Mr Rae said there were a number of services the state government had provided initial funding for but the burden had then fallen to the council.Mr Rae said regional and rural councils were hit harder by cost shifting than metropolitan councils due to limited revenue opportunities, larger geographical areas, dispersed population and settlement patterns.Mr Rae said local councils were severely impacted by government legislation and policy changes.Mr Rae said local councils needed to be consulted prior to structure or system changes.Mr Rae said the council was also being forced to look into becoming a childcare provider due to the lack of available spots for families.Mr Rae said another challenge for rural and regional councils was offering similar salaries to those in other areas of the state.Mr Rae said the state government should also consider reviewing the rate cap policy.Warrnambool City Council's mayor Ben Blain and chief executive officer Andrew Mason spoke about similar cost shifting issues in the city's submission.The submission said cost shifting had occurred with school crossing supervisors, maternal and child health services and maintenance of Crown land.Despite a better injury rate, Warrnambool City Council's WorkCover premium has increased from $600,000 to more than $1 million, the submission states.It also draws attention to the increased landfill levy and the windfall gains tax.Attracting skilled employees is also an issue for the Warrnambool City Council, the submission states.Moyne Shire Council's submission was prepared by Peter Brown, the council's former acting chief executive officer.He said there were a number of factors that were contributing to this, including cost shifting from other levels of government to local government and rate capping.Mr Brown said rate capping was not equitable.He said rate capping had recently been set at lower levels than inflation and the increases to wages and other costs.He said rural councils were also forced to spend large amount of money on roads.",

Apparently, Milwaukee is part of Minnesota. This, according to Fox News' Laura Ingraham. \"If you know Minnesota well, and I know it well especially Milwaukee it's changed,\" she said during her program on Wednesday. \"It has never recovered from 2020 and it is not the same place. And Tim Walz was empathizing with all the DEI initiatives that were swirling about.\" I don't know how to attach the tweets sorry.

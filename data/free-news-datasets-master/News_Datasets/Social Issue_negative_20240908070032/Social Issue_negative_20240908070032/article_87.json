    "text": "Andy Cohen is adding his voice to the recent backlash Luis Ruelas has been facing since the Real Housewives of New Jersey finale. During a recent appearance on Bitch Sesh: A Real Housewives Breakdown , Cohen admitted that his perspective on the franchise “has shifted a little bit since becoming a dad.” He admitted that he was especially struck by the “dark” comments Ruelas’ made about Margaret Josephs’ family in the RHONJ finale. The episode showed Ruelas and Teresa Giudice discussing how they wanted to face their castmates during “The Last Supper.” “Tell her to stay away from our family,” he told Giudice. “I hope Margaret and her family suffer. I hope her fucking son suffers the way I suffered, the way other people in our family suffered, dealing with a woman like that.” He also called Josephs a “disgusting, vile human being.” While reflecting on the episode, Cohen said, “If someone that I didn’t care for invoked either of my children’s names, I would go…as ‘mellow yellow’ as I usually am, that is what it would take for me.” He then compared himself to RHONJ star Danielle Cabral . “Danielle Cabral’s button is ‘Don’t talk about my husband’s pecs.’ Mine would be, ‘If you mention my children in an unfavorable way,'” he said. “Like, I would go absolutely mental. I assume that’s just very common.” Podcast co-hosts Casey Wilson and Danielle Schneider noted that Giudice and her RHONJ cast mates have “never gone after each other’s children.” “Children have always been of importance to these women,” they pointed out. Ruelas addressed the controversial moment on social media after watching the finale and attempted to explain his perspective. “I was disappointed in my actions in bringing up Margaret Josephs’ son,” he said. “The reason he was even brought up was because I have been dealing with being falsely accused of calling Margaret’s son at his work which is simply not true.” He claimed Josephs had bene spreading a false “narrative” for the past year. “Still, I know better not to bring someone’s child up and it is something I deeply regret so I do want to apologize and acknowledge that I was wrong,” he said. The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 14 is currently streaming on Peacock .",

    "text": "Trending: Noahj456 Cheating Controversy: Fuslie Breaks Silence, Says Had An 'Emotional Affair' Streamer Leslie Ann Fu, known as Fuslie, recently admitted to an affair with NoahJ456 during a YouTube Livestream. The affair reportedly happened at EDC 2021 and played a role in canceling the ZHouse project. Fuslie apologized for her actions, acknowledging her mistakes, while NoahJ456 has yet to issue a statement. One of the recent allegations that emerged in the online gaming/streaming industry is one from streamer Leslie Ann Fu—Fuslie, taking down another popular figure NoahJ456. The drama started after Canadian YouTuber MrTLexify shared the gossip while watching his own allegations from ex-girlfriend Reagan McNulty (Puresoftie) about an affair they had committed. As per a video from MrTLexify, the reported affair between Fuslie and NoahJ456 took place at Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) 2021 that ultimately led to why ZHouse project number three in Texas was canceled.

Fuslie, who broke up with Edison Park just weeks ago has confirmed the infidelity during an emotional YouTube Livestream. She revealed she bonded with NoahJ456 at the 100 Thieves creator camp after realizing they both have their own struggles. However, Fuslie told Ludwig that she developed respectful feelings towards them and began to disregard their ethical line.

She may or may not have gone on and did the same thing in an emotional apology where she lamented, \"I just wanted to say that I'm a person who definitely fucks up — doesn't want to be put on a pedestal… I do not want you to be me or forgive my soul. \"Her vulnerability underscores her awareness in the complexity of what I write and how she has personally f---d up.\" Fuslie apologized for her actions in an open post, but NoahJ456 has not issued a statement. This story has triggered a great deal of discussion in the broader online community.

    "text": "On a recent episode of The Ranveer Allahbadia Show, John Abraham shared intriguing insights into his career journey and personal experiences. Reflecting on facing harsh comments from Bollywood celebrities on Karan Johar's chat show Koffee with Karan, John recalled how, during that period, he was perceived unfavorably on the show. He mentioned that not just on Koffee With Karan, but Bollywood magazines were also writing against hi. He recalled an editor from a film magazine once declared him “over,” a sentiment echoed by many in the industry at the time. Interestingly, that same editor is now one of his producers. John revealed that he never understood the reasoning behind the editor’s harsh judgment and learned that sometimes negativity stems from personal issues rather than valid reasons. John emphasized the importance of focusing on one’s work despite external criticism. He compared himself to a horse with blinkers, suggesting that he remains focused on his goals and ignores distractions. He admitted that he sometimes reacts to provocation but always tries to return to focusing on his work. Discussing his recent film Vedaa, John talked about a press conference where he was intentionally provoked. He acknowledged that his reaction was a loss for him, as it distracted him from his primary goal. John advised the host and others to not let negative comments or attempts to pull them down affect their focus.112297537John revealed that he has always prioritized his work over social interactions and networking. He noted that he doesn't engage with social media and avoids reading comments, which helps him stay unaffected by online negativity. He believes that dealing with trolls and criticism becomes easier when you remain focused on your goals and maintain self-conviction. Reflecting on his early career, John shared that winning the Gladrags modeling competition was a significant moment for him, but at that time, he was not considering a career in films. He wanted to be a supermodel and appreciated the support he received from his boss who allowed him to take a sabbatical from work to pursue modeling.112351992 John concluded that success is about setting and achieving personal benchmarks rather than comparing oneself to others. He expressed pride in his journey and emphasized that one's focus should remain on their own path and growth.",

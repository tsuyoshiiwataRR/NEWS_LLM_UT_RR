    "text": "PRAYAGRAJ: Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. “Ghosts” seem to prowl Uttar Pradesh police files when the complainant was dead three years before FIR filing, the Allahabad HC observed in one such bizarre matter.The paranormal parable did not end there in the cheating case filed with Kushinagar police. The investigating officer was shown duly “recording” statement of the dead man and even filing a chargesheet against the accused. Justice Saurabh Shyam Shamshery was left more baffled when the files showed the complainant had even signed the vakalatnama (affidavit) “on Dec 19, 2023” when he had died in 2011. The FIR was lodged in 2014.“It appears that all the proceedings are undertaken by a ghost,” Justice Saurabh Shyam Shamshery said, unable to take the surreal saga anymore during a hearing on Aug 6. The HC quashed the proceedings and ordered Kushinagar SP to probe the IO’s conduct in the case.“It is strange that a dead person has not only lodged an FIR but has recorded his statement before the IO and, thereafter, a vakalatnama has also been filed on his behalf,” Justice Shamshery said.The FIR was filed at Kotwali Hata police station of Kushinagar. Shabd Prakash, the complainant mentioned, had died on Dec 19, 2011. This was corroborated by his official records, including the death certificate, and testimony of his wife.",

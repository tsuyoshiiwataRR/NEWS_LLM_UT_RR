    "text": "Questions are being asked about the use of force by an undercover Toronto police officer against a civilian during the arrest of another individual last weekend.\nVideo exclusively shot by CityNews shows a group of undercover officers attempting to subdue another individual in an alleyway in the area of Dundas Street East and Victoria Street Lane around 7 p.m. on August 3.\nAs the officers continue to subdue the individual, a man walks up and puts his hand on one of the officers which is quickly swatted away. Two of the officers then identify themselves by producing their badges when a third undercover officer rushes in and forcibly pushes the man to the ground.\nThe man appears to hit his head on the concrete and is immediately surrounded by other passersby. The officer who was seen pushing the man to the ground approaches the group and while being questioned, gestures toward the other officers while appearing to provide an explanation before going back to the group of officers.\nThe province’s Special Investigations Unit tells CityNews it is looking into the incident, adding that “the man was taken to hospital via EMS and diagnosed with serious injuries in hospital.”\nThe Toronto Police Service tells CityNews it informed the SIU about the incident in the early morning hours of August 4 but could not comment any further as they are currently investigating.\nIn response to the video, Toronto Police Association President Jon Reid tells CityNews civilians should never involve themselves in police operations as it creates “unpredictability in a situation that is already tense and volatile.”\n“Aside from this case, we can say that members of the public should never interfere with police operations, including physically engaging with officers. Officers do not know the motive or intent of the person interfering, nor do they know if they are armed, under the influence, etc.,” Reid said in a statement. “We understand that watching someone get arrested can be upsetting; often there is a struggle. Officers are trained to use the least amount of force necessary but are lawfully entitled to use the force that is required to render a situation safe for all involved, including themselves. “\nAlok Mukherjee, the former chair of the Toronto Police Services Board, says that based on what he saw in the video there are “serious reasons” to be concerned about the actions taken by the undercover officer.\n“There are several officers there, but it’s the action of one that is the most disturbing and concerning,” he tells CityNews. “It constitutes an unprovoked violent assault. There’s no two ways about it in my mind.”\nRegardless of the outcome of the SIU investigation, Mukherjee says Police Chief Myron Demkiw can further investigate the incident and proceed with charges under the Police Services Act.\n“I think that is something that should be very seriously conducted.”\nThe incident comes on the heels of a Toronto police officer charged with aggravated assault after a person in custody was injured last January and an investigation into another officer’s conduct after she was captured on video making an inappropriate gesture towards a citizen during a spat about illegal parking.\nShauna Hunt contributed to this report\nSubmit a Correction Accessibility Feedback Top Stories Train washing post for yet-to-be-opened Eglinton Crosstown LRT raises ire Ontario government officials haven't provided a public, in-depth update on the Eglinton Crosstown LRT since December.\n1h ago\nToronto, GTA under special weather statement ahead of possible heavy rain from Tropical Storm Debby A special weather statement is in effect for Toronto and the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area as incoming rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to saturate parts of the region on Friday.

    "text": "Does the Nevada GOP support dismantling the Department of Education? YES In its 2024 party platform, the Nevada Republican Party calls for breaking up the federal Department of Education. “We support the elimination of the unconstitutional US Department of Education,” the platform reads, asserting that “education is a state and local responsibility.” Congress created the Department of Education in 1979 as an agency to establish education policies, implement laws and oversee, coordinate and distribute federal financial aid. Republican calls to dismantle the agency have been made since it was founded. This Fact Brief is responsive to conversations such as this one .

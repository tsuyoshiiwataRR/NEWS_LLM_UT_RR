    "text": "Republican States Sue Biden Administration Over Health Insurance for DACA Recipients Fifteen Republican-led states, spearheaded by Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, have filed a lawsuit to prevent the Biden administration from granting health insurance access to DACA recipients. The states argue this violates federal law by offering public benefits to individuals lacking legal immigration status. The lawsuit arrives amid heated immigration debates ahead of the 2024 presidential election. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 09-08-2024 02:35 IST | Created: 09-08-2024 02:35 IST Fifteen Republican-led states, led by Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, filed a lawsuit on Thursday to block the Biden administration's plan to provide health insurance to up to 200,000 immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. The lawsuit challenges a May rule by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that classifies Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) participants as \"legally present\" in the U.S., allowing them access to healthcare programs under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Kansas and the other states claim the rule incentivizes illegal immigration by encouraging DACA recipients to remain in the U.S., thereby increasing states' public service costs. The White House and HHS have yet to comment. Meanwhile, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has mandated state officials to track medical care costs for illegal immigrants. (With inputs from agencies.)",

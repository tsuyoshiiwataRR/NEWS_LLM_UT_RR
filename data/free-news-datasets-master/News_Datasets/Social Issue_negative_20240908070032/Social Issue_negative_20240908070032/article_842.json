    "text": "Source: Business InsiderAug 8, 2024, 9:27 AM EDT A group of Democratic lawmakers wants answers from a major student-loan company on its debt relief process for the borrowers it services. On Thursday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Madeleine Dean led 33 of their Democratic colleagues including Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ayanna Pressley in requesting more information from Navient on how it handles debt discharges for borrowers who said they were defrauded by the schools they attended. The issue at play: There's a process for borrowers with federal student loans to apply for a debt discharge if they can prove they were defrauded by their school. It's known as the borrower defense to repayment. President Joe Biden's Education Department has canceled debt for millions of borrowers over the past few years under that process. But borrowers with private loans managed by Navient cannot access the federal process. They can request a school-misconduct discharge application from Navient to attempt to get rid of their loans, but some borrowers previously told Business Insider the process was lengthy and burdensome, leaving some of them with discharge denials they struggled to understand. The lawmakers wrote in their letter to Navient first viewed by BI that borrowers were continuing to be \"improperly\" rejected for relief and that they wanted updated information on how the company was carrying out the process.Read more: https://www.businessinsider.com/student-loan-company-navient-rejecting-debt-cancellation-borrowers-defrauded-relief-2024-8",

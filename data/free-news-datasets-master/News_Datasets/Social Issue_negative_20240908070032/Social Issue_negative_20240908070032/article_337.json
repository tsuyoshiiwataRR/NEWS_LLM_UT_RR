But I think the people of Jan. 6 were treated very unfairly. “The biggest crowd I’ve ever spoken before was that day,” he continued. “And I’ll tell you, it’s very hard to find a picture of that crowd. … If you look at Martin Luther King, when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours. Same real estate. Same everything. Same number of people, if not, we had more.” “We actually had more people. They said I had 25,000, and he had 1 million people. And I’m OK with it, because I liked Dr. Martin Luther King,” Trump concluded.

Old Weirdo is melting down fast. His campaign team needs to stick him in the freezer before he’s just a puddle or orange goo on the floor.",

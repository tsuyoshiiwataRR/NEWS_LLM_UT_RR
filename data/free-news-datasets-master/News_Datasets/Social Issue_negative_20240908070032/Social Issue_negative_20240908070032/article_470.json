    "text": "‘A slap in the face’: Attorney representing Sade Robinson’s family criticizes information release in murder case, WISN reports 33-year-old Maxwell Anderson is charged with murdering 19-year-old Sade Robinson after a first date in April MILWAUKEE, Wis. ( [WISN](https://www.wisn.com/article/a-slap-in-the-face-attorney-representing-sade-robinsons-family-criticizes-information-release-in-murder-case/61820953)) - The attorney representing the family of murdered 19-year-old Sade Robinson is calling the release of information in Robinson’s murder “a slap in the face,” according to a report from WISN, Action 2 News’ Milwaukee affiliate. [A recently unsealed search warrant obtained by WISN 12 News](https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-informant-reveals-anderson-planned-to-kill-dismember-robinson/61805317) Tuesday highlights a statement a confidential police informant made to Milwaukee police detectives. The informant claims 33-year-old Maxwell Anderson, charged in Robinson’s murder, had a plan to kill Robinson for weeks before the murder took place. Attorney Verona Swanigan, representing Robinson’s family, tells WISN 12 News that family members first heard this information from news reports Tuesday. “Anderson is calculated and callous, and he treated Sade Robinson like prey,” Swanigan said in a statement to WISN 12 News Wednesday. Robinson was last seen alive out on a dinner date with Anderson to Milwaukee’s Twisted Fisherman on April 1. The next day, someone found her severed leg at Warnimont Park in Cudahy. Days later, her burned-out car and other body parts were found near 30th Street and Lisbon Avenue in Milwaukee. [Anderson was charged with killing her on April 12.](https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-man-charged-with-homicide-in-severed-leg-investigation/60479757) In the newly unsealed search warrants obtained by WISN 12 News, detectives said a confidential informant was inside Anderson’s basement on March 5 — weeks before Robinson’s murder. The informant described a room in the basement with a sanitation sink and tarps “taped to the floor and the ceiling, covering the walls and the floor.” The informant also told investigators Anderson detailed a plan to shoot Robinson before dismembering her in the basement and “disposing her body throughout the city.” “It all indicates a pattern of behavior by Maxwell Anderson that is vile, heinous, evil - that must be investigated further,” Swanigan said. Swanigan said Robinson’s family first heard about these gruesome details from news reports, and now she is asking for advance notice from officials before such documents are unsealed. Robinson’s mother, Sheena Scarbrough, tells WISN 12 News that finding out new details about her daughter’s murder from the news is deeply upsetting. “The devastation and the heartache that it’s taking on her to find all of this out in piecemeal portions...It sort of feels like a slap in the face,” Swanigan said about Scarbrough. Swanigan also tells WISN 12 News Robinson’s family doesn’t understand why the confidential informant didn’t come forward with the details of Anderson’s plan before Robinson’s murder. “Are these questions really eating at Sade’s family?” asked WISN 12 News reporter Emily Pofahl. “They are. They are disturbing to them,” Swanigan said. Maxwell Anderson’s lawyer is disputing the informant’s claims. Attorney Anthony Cotton said in a statement to WISN 12 News that “information from people who want to be labeled as ‘confidential informants’ is often false and exaggerated.” Anderson is currently being held in the Milwaukee County Jail, charged with first-degree intentional homicide, mutilation of a corpse and arson. [He has pleaded not guilty.](https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-man-maxwell-anderson-charged-killing-dismembering-milwaukee-teen-sade-robinson-not-guilty-plea/60571146) Anderson’s trial is scheduled for December.

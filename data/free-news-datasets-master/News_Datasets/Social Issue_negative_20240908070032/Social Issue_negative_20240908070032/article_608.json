    "text": "MONTREAL – About 2,600 unionized employees from hotels in some of the province’s largest cities walked off the job Thursday, protesting an impasse in contract talks.\nThe 24-hour strike hit 23 hotels in Montreal, Quebec City and Sherbrooke.\nÉric Hamel, general manager of an association representing Montreal hotels, said that despite the strike it was business as usual in the city.\nWorkers demonstrate in front of the Hilton DoubleTree in downtown Montreal on Thursday. Over 2,600 workers from 23 hotels in Montreal, Laval, Quebec City and Sherbrooke held a one-day strike to exert pressure on their employers. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Pierre Saint-Arnaud Negotiations between hotel owners and the workers’ union — Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN) — have stalled since the union first threatened a provincewide strike last week.\nHotel employees have seven key demands, including a 36 per cent pay raise over four years and an end to the use of private employment agencies.\nHamel says the employers are ready to negotiate but do not have the capacity to pay the salary demands.\nThe strike involved 16 Montreal hotels, including the Queen Elizabeth, Bonaventure and The Ritz-Carlton, five in the Quebec City region and two in Sherbrooke.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 8, 2024.",

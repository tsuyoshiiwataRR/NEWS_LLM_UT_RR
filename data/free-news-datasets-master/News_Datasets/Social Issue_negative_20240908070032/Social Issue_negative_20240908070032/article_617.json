We have more newsletters\nShow Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice A paedophile who sexually touched up a young girl in his care volunteered more offences to the police when he was interviewed, a court heard. Stephen William Wells told officers who interviewed and charged him with five counts of sexual assault on a young girl that if they searched his phone and personal computer they would discover hundreds of images of children being sexually abused - which they did.\nAppearing before Truro Crown Court for sentencing today (Thursday, August 8), having pleaded guilty to all charges against him at Truro Magistrates&apos; Court last month, it was heard that the 68-year-old from Northey Close in Shortlanesend started touching up the girl.\nJason Beal, prosecuting, said Wells&apos; crimes were discovered when his victim gave reason for her mum to become suspicious and she then informed the NSPCC children&apos;s charity and Devon and Cornwall Police . In a victim impact statement read out in court, Well&apos;s victim&apos;s mother said the assault had devastated her whole family and left her daughter traumatised, angry and sad.\nRead next: Jailed in July at Truro Crown Court: Fake builder who lied about wife&apos;s death and other criminals banged up\nRead next: Paedophile left girl, 13, so traumatised she was unable to go to school\nRobin Smith, defending, said Wells had not shrunk from his shocking behaviour and had made a full admission to the police after being arrested and charged almost three years ago. He said: \"In his interview with the police he admitted other things to officers and told them that they would find indecent pictures of children on his electronic devices. He accepts his fate today.\"\nMs Smith added: \"He was in the grip of an alcohol dependency and had been for some time which had a degree of impact on his thinking. Being arrested by police in 2021 was a watershed moment for him.\"\nGet the best stories and latest news delivered to your inbox every day. Choose what you want here .\nHis honour Judge Simon Carr told Wells the abuse he inflicted had been systematic and prolonged adding that he had broken this young person&apos;s and her family&apos;s trust in the worst possible way.\nHe added: \"This abuse went on... for your own sexual gratification and when your devices were examined hundreds of images of the worst type of child abuse were found. Your actions have had a profound effect on your victim and her family who have shown great courage to appear in court today. Your alcohol problem does not justify or explain your behaviour in any way.\"\nWells was sentenced to five years in prison. He will also remain on the sex offenders register for life.\n⚠️ Want the latest Cornwall breaking news and top stories first?

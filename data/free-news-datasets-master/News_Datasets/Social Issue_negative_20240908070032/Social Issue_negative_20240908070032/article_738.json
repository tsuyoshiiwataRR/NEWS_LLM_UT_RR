Apart from this, surveillance cameras should also be installed inside these buildings at appropriate places like underground parking, generators power control rooms.\nPolice have asked bus drivers and conductors to park buses under their supervision, keep a strict watch on the bus and immediately inform the police through any medium in case of any suspicious situation.\nAccording to the guidelines, every mall management and industry owner should appoint security guards at their place and get their character and criminal record verified. Also, instruct the security guards to immediately inform the police station about any suspicious person.\nMobile phone and SIM card sellers should issue mobile phone connections only after proper identification and verification of identity documents, police said.\nGuest house, hotel, and restaurant owners should keep complete details of the people staying at their place and maintain their complete records.

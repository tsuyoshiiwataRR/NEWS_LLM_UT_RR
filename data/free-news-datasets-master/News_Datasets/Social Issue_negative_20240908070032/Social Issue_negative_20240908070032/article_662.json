    "text": "MIDDLETOWN TOWNSHIP, Pa. (CBS) â€“ Rugby players are angry and frustrated after vandals targeted their home field in Delaware County.\nDeep trenches were dug into the grass Tuesday night when a group of drivers apparently made doughnuts at Longview Park in Middletown Township.\nThe large ruts and divots left behind are a trip hazard for the Media Rugby Football Club, which uses the field for games.\n\"We were upset, disappointed as you can understand,\" Media Rugby Football Club facilities manager Travis Kokoska said. \"We've put a lot of time and money into curating the field.\"\nThis is the second time in less than a year that vandals have torn up the turf. The same thing happened in October 2023, after which the township put up a row of boulders and a concrete bench to prevent people from driving on the field.\n\"Unfortunately, we're finding out with this episode that it did not work,\" John McMullan, township manager of Middletown Township, said. \"We'll have to go back and review the steps we've taken.\"\nCrews will have to work quickly to repair the field before rugby season begins in September. The damage is estimated at $10,000.\nMore from CBS News Video shows Zach Bryan fans sheltering from heavy storms during concert in Philadelphia NJ community remains partially flooded as more rain expected Friday Delco firefighters grieve former fire chief who spent 80 years with department New design planned for Radnor Township overhead warning system to prevent bridge strikes Sheep, goats seized from Pa. farm after reports of young animals \"suddenly dying\" In: Pennsylvania Rugby Vandalism Delaware County Madeleine Wright Madeleine Wright is a bilingual general assignment reporter for CBS News Philadelphia who is fluent in Spanish.

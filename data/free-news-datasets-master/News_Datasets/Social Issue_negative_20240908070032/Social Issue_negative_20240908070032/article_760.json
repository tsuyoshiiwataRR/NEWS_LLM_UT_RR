    "text": "JOHNSTOWN — A 2023 report on veteran suicides released by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs suggested suicide among veterans is on the rise. There were 6,392 veteran suicide deaths in 2021 — 114 more than in 2020, according to the report. On West Main Street in Johnstown, the Vet-to-Vet Center, backed by the Mental Health Association in Fulton and Montgomery Counties under the Joseph P. Dwyer Peer Support Foundation, opened this summer seeks to help veterans who are at risk of suicide. PFC Joseph P. Dwyer was an Iraq combat medic from Long Island, who returned from the war with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and ended up taking his own life in 2008. As a result, then-state Sen. Lee Zeldin from Long Island led the initiative to launch the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Peer Support Project, which began first in Suffolk, Jefferson, Saratoga and Rensselaer counties, in order to help veterans meet with other veterans in a secure, comfortable atmosphere to help each other cope with the effects of PTSD and TBI. State funds for the program were first a part of the 2012 New York state budget. The program has since expanded to even more counties across the state, including Fulton and Montgomery counties. The program's veteran-to-veteran approach allows for complete anonymity without fear of reprisal. It utilizes peer support from those who can relate to the struggles of transitioning into civilian life. And its goal is to link veterans for socialization and friendship. The non-clinical program does not provide case management for individuals. However, it does connect veterans with other service providers in the community if there is a specific need. Tom Elwood, program director for the Fulton County chapter, is himself a veteran. The St. Johnsville High School graduate joined the National Guard in 2004, and later deployed to Iraq in 2009 as military police sent to train Iraqi police in combat operations. He was honorably discharged in 2012. “The sole purpose behind the program is to prevent veteran suicide,” he said. Just last week, a 30-year-old National Guardsman who was getting ready to deploy again took his own life, Elwood said. “We are reaching out to those still serving and veterans because it matters,” he said. With approximately 4,000 veterans residing in Fulton County, the program is highlighting the need for solidarity for mutual support. “Let the veteran know they are not alone. There are some hidden in the woodwork but know this — that we are here’” he said. When someone deploys, their life changes, Elwood explained, and this is a factor in suicide. “One of the biggest issues is that most veterans like to have firearms. They stay away from the clinical aspect for fear their weapons will be taken away,” Elwood said. He said when veterans talk to each other it is a whole different lingo, a whole language of their own. Among the programs and partnerships is with a fitness club. Elwood hopes to create a family support group. And there are plans to take a trip to Pine Tree Rifle Club. The center at 128 West Main St. is open Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. “We don’t turn anyone away,” Elwood said. -",

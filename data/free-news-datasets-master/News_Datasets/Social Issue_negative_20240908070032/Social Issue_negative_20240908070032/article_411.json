    "text": "A suspect has been arrested in connection with a stabbing that left a man dead last month in the victimâ€™s Chula Vista apartment.\nMembers of the San Diego Regional Fugitive Task Force arrested Jesus Salas Medina, 44, on Monday afternoon on suspicion of killing 49-year-old Rodolfo Duron Jr., according to the Chula Vista Police Department.\nAn assault was reported at the Terra Vista residential complex on Santa Lucia Road on July 19, and officers found Duron mortally wounded about 8 p.m., Sgt. Anthony Molina said. The victim died at the scene.\nAccording to witnesses, the killer broke into the apartment wearing a mask and attacked Duron before fleeing, possibly aboard a motor scooter.\nMedina remains jailed without bail.\nPolice have released no suspected motive for the fatal assault and have disclosed no known relationship between the two men.\nMedina has been charged with murder, plus an allegation of using a knife in the killing. He pleaded not guilty during an arraignment on Wednesday and faces up to 26 years to life in state prison if convicted.",

    "text": "The National Communications Officer of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Sammy Gyamfi, has stated that the investigations into the Airbus deal were solely initiated because former President John Mahama and his brother, Samuel Foster Adam, were linked to it.\nAccording to him, the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) saw it as an opportunity to tarnish Mr Mahama’s reputation.\nHe argued that the former Special Prosecutor, Martin Amidu once alleged that President Akufo-Addo was mounting pressure on him to indict the NDC flagbearer.\nSpeaking on Joy FM’s Top Story, he explained that this was the NPP’s attempt to promote the propaganda that Mahama is not fit to run for office again, alleging that during his term as Vice President, he awarded contracts to his brother.\nMr Gyamfi told the host that candidate Mahama is clean and incorruptible, and the Office of the Special Prosecutor has only enhanced his image publicly.\nRead also : Airbus bribery scandal: John Mahama is ‘Government Official 1’ but… – OSP “Martin Amidu, the first special prosecutor actually came out to say that there was incessant pressure on him from President Akufo-Addo for him to indict John Mahama at all cost relative to this airbus matters.\n“It’s been clear from day one that the NPP had an evil agenda to smear Mahama with lies that have been exposed. John Mahama’s innocence is vindicated and today he stands squeaky clean as an incorruptible leader, seven and half years after leaving office,” he said on August 8.\nRead also : Airbus bribery scandal: Once again, John Mahama has been vindicated – Sammy Gyamfi The Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) named former President John Dramani Mahama as the individual referenced as ‘Government official 1’ in the Airbus bribery scandal, but said there is no evidence to show that he was paid any bribes.\nThis conclusion, according to the Special Prosecutor Kissi Agyebeng, follows an extensive investigation spanning four years by his office.\nAddressing the media in Accra, Mr Agyebeng explained that the investigation into the scandal and the revelation of the identities of the persons involved were necessary due to the public interest in the issue.\nThe NDC’s National Communicator explained that Mr Mahama had no intention of awarding contracts to his brother.\nHowever, Mr Adam and his associates were introduced in the Airbus deal as intermediaries after the government had agreed to the purchase. As the Special Prosecutor put it, this “was a case of a lacklustre coincidence.”",

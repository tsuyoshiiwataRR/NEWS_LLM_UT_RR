    "text": "Personally, I’ve had experience with any number of incredibly creative and talented people who couldn’t market their way out of a wet paper sack. And I totally get it. When you’re using all of your talent to build things, other things fall by the wayside. That’s why I’m glad to see folks trying to solve that problem for promising entrepreneurs — and everyone else. Meet\nBLUPRNT.\nIn the past, businesses would invest large amounts of time and money into a once-every-few-years strategic workshop to establish their market positioning, value proposition, the works… because these experiences were highly time consuming and expensive, most anyone who has gone through the experience has become conditioned to believe that this is not an iterative process – with BLUPRNT, startups can update any element of their identity, customer profile or competitive set in a few minutes and in doing so, change their market positioning almost instantly. This allows startups to iterate their brand as often as any other element of their business. Cool, right?\nI had a chance to test drive an early version of this. And as a marketing person for the last — checks watch — 30 years or so, I have to say that, even in its formative stages, the tool helped reveal some interesting insights and focus points. So even if you consider yourself a marketing-type, it’s still worth a look.\nBest of all? BLUPRNT struck me as a practical example of leveraging AI for a specific market that might not be comfortable with AI. It didn’t strike me as an “AI for AI’s sake” sort of pursuit.\nThe product starts at $99/year and is currently taking on new users. In fact,\nthey appeared on Product Hunt today. (So if you’re into that sort of thing, maybe swing by and support them.)\nAnd another fun fact: BLUPRNT cofounder Austin Buell was the one who did this\ninteresting analysis of the 2024 Oregon Innovation Index using AI.\nFor more information, visit\nBLUPRNT.",

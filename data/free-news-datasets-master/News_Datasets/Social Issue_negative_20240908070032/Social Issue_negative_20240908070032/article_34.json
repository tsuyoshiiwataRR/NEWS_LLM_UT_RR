    "text": "Photo: Marcia Straub/Moment/Getty Images\nSeveral locations of a popular retail chain are closing around North Carolina in an effort to address financial struggles.\nNational big box chain Big Lots, known for giving customers the opportunity to shop for discount home goods, is seemingly closing nearly 300 of its 1,389 stores around the country weeks after initially revealing plans to only close around 40 locations amid the company's financial struggles. Big Lots reported a $114.5 million sales decrease from the first quarter of 2023 to the first of 2024 and has seen a 84% drop in stock over the past year.\nIn an effort to address financial issues and stave off bankruptcy, the company appears to be shuttering hundreds of stores around the U.S. While states like California are seeing dozens of stores closing, a handful in North Carolina are affected.\nOf the 75 Big Lots locations in the Tar Heel State, seven are set to close down, according to the company's website, which features a banner announcing the select location's closure alongside notice of a sale. Here are all the North Carolina Big Lots stores set to shut down:\n8215 University City Blvd., Ste. E, Charlotte 9535 S Blvd., Ste. C, Charlotte 2000 Avondale Dr., Ste. E, Durham 3420 Southwest Durham Dr., Durham 822 E Main St., Jefferson 1515 Garner Station Blvd., Raleigh 6540 Glenwood Ave., Raleigh For a full list of Big Lots locations in North Carolina, visit the company's website .",

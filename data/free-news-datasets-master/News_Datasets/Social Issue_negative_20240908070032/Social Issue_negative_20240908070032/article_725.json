    "title": "Tennessee Republican Congressman Andy Ogles faces FBI investigation",
    "text": "FBI probe of Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles is serious. District 5 voters don't seem to care The question Tennessee congressional District 5 voters should ask themselves at the polls is which candidate will best represent their values in Congress. The FBI confiscated incumbent [District 5 U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles’ phone](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2024/08/06/fbi-confiscates-rep-andy-ogles-phone-amid-campaign-finance-issues/74692131007/) the day after he won the Aug. 1 Republican primary election. Two things can be true: First, Ogles should not be presumed guilty of anything. This is an investigation, not a trial, and the congressman said in [a post on X](https://x.com/AndyOgles/status/1820916720510357929) that he plans to cooperate with authorities. “I am confident all involved will conclude that the reporting discrepancies were based on honest mistakes, and nothing more,” he said. Second, this investigation does not mean that the Biden Administration singularly targeted Ogles for political purposes despite speculation about a deep-state conspiracy theory from his supporters on social media. Republican politicians, including Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, have accused the [White House of engaging in “lawfare,”](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/30/trump-conviction-trump-felon-tennessee-lawmakers-reacted-to-the-verdict/73912596007/) or using the power of the government to go after rivals including former President Donald Trump. No other Tennessee member of Congress is being probed by the FBI Nevertheless, this inquiry is incredibly serious and it is important to note that none of Tennessee’s other members of Congress, all Republicans except one – two senators and eight representatives besides Ogles – have had their property seized by law enforcement. Not Senators Marsha Blackburn or Bill Hagerty. Not Republican U.S. Reps. Diana Harshbarger (District 1), Tim Burchett (District 2), Chuck Fleischmann (District 3), Scott DesJarlais (District 4), John Rose (District 6), Mark Green (District 7) or David Kustoff (District 8). Not Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen (District 9). Trump-backed Ogles [filed articles of impeachment](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/23/andy-ogles-files-impeachment-articles-against-vp-kamala-harris/74517856007/) against Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. However, Green, in District 7, successfully led the effort in the U.S. House of Representatives to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, though the Senate did not convict the Cabinet secretary. Trump calls Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee [a phony Republican. This deserves a response.](https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/david-plazas/2024/08/06/trump-tennessee-gov-bill-lee-republican-insult-rino/74688154007/) This goes to show that political disagreements and rhetoric do not lead to lawfare. Ogles has faced campaign finance problems since he was elected Ogles said in his post that he believes the FBI is investigating him over campaign finance filing irregularities. The District 5 congressman, who was elected in 2022, has faced campaign finance problems for the last two years. The Tennessean reported that he was required to pay [$5,750 in civil penalties for violations](https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pithinthewind/andy-ogles-pays-fec-fine/article_1cdd47c4-9484-11ee-898a-6f40d83b66c7.html) during the 2022 election cycle. A [$320,000 loan to himself](https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pithinthewind/andy-ogles-pays-fec-fine/article_1cdd47c4-9484-11ee-898a-6f40d83b66c7.html), which was reported as cash to the Federal Elections Commission, turned out to be just a pledge for the 2024 election, Ogles recently admitted. Voters in District 5, which includes all or parts of Davidson, Wilson, Williamson and Maury counties, knew this information. VP Kamala Harris word salads [reveal something sinister about her political worldview](https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/civility/2024/08/07/election-2024-kamala-harris-word-salads-ideology/74693347007/) In fact, Ogles’ GOP opponent Courtney Johnston ran a better-financed campaign exploiting these irregularities. But the 54.8% of voters who backed Ogles on Aug. 1 did not know or did not care. Will District 5 voters think Ogles or Abolfazli is a better fit? The FBI will not comment on the investigation, but the Department of Justice typically does not overtly take investigative action against candidates 60 days prior to an election, The Tennessean reports. Now, the news is out and voters in the Republican-leaning district – which was created in a 2022 gerrymander that diluted Nashville-Davidson County’s vote – will have to decide if the phone seizure is relevant. Ogles faces Democrat [Maryam Abolfazli](https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/editorials/2024/07/01/tennessee-election-congress-maryam-abolfazli-house-district-5/74268649007/) in the Nov. 5 general election. In a statement Tuesday, she said, “The FBI’s execution of a search warrant and confiscation of Andy Ogles’ cell phone is deeply upsetting, especially given an ongoing pattern of misappropriated funds and falsehoods regarding his education and work history.” Johnston could not make the case that this mattered to the majority of voters in District 5. Will the FBI’s phone seizure make a difference in November? The question voters should ask themselves at the polls is which candidate will best represent their values in Congress. The answer on Nov. 5 will be incredibly revealing. David Plazas is the director of opinion and engagement for the USA TODAY Network Tennessee. He is an editorial board member of The Tennessean.

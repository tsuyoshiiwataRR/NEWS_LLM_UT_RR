    "text": "Despite ranking among the best in the nation in terms of the number of pharmacies on street corners, pharmacists in Kentucky say stores are closing, and there’s little relief in sight. LEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT)—Kentucky is ranked among the best in the nation for the number of pharmacies on street corners. We’re third per capita, trailing just New York and West Virginia. Despite those numbers, pharmacists say stores are closing, and there’s little relief in sight. “I get phone calls literally daily of pharmacies that are considering closure,” notes Dr. Ben Mudd. Mudd used to work in a retail pharmacy. Now, as the Executive Director of the Kentucky Pharmacists Association, he advocates for them. “Pharmacies are filling more prescriptions than they ever have, but they’re not making enough money to keep the lights on and pay their folks,” he says. “Not only are we seeing under reimbursement for the drug, we’re not getting paid dispensing fees, so it’s not just about the cost of the drug. It’s also what it costs to have employees and have an actual location for people to visit, have a pharmacist that they can talk to,” explains Dr. Shelley Roberts. Roberts started Grassroots Pharmacy in Lexington with her husband seven years ago. She says costs have risen since then, and reimbursements have fallen. In the past two years, 80 independently owned pharmacies—like Grassroots—have closed their doors for good, according to the Kentucky Pharmacists Association. The closures come on top of CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid closing stores and slowing their own growth. There is some hope for pharmacists. The governor signed Senate Bill 188 earlier this year. It’s supposed to restrict pharmacy benefit managers, also called PBMs. They help negotiate prescription drug sales and keep a share of all proceeds. Several years ago, Kentucky passed a law cutting PBMs out of the state’s Medicaid program. Senate Bill 188 has similar restrictions but on private health insurers. The bill won’t go into effect until January 1, 2025. Copyright 2024 WKYT. All rights reserved.",

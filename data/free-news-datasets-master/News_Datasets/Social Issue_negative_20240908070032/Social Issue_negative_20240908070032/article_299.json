    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday issued an [executive order](https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/EO-GA-46_HHSC_Alienage_Data_IMAGE_08-08-2024.pdf) that requires Texas public hospitals to collect information on undocumented immigrants who receive care, including the cost of care, in an effort to get the federal government to pay the state for those costs. In a release, Abbott said he issued the order because of what he called President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' \"open border policies.\" RELATED: [Abbott ordena a hospitales públicos de Texas recopilar información sobre inmigrantes indocumentados](/article/news/local/texas/abbott-ordena-hospitales-texas-inmigrantes-indocumentados/285-dc68f55d-bb3d-4ab2-81c8-b2f2c45d6ba8) Abbott said the state would be fighting to get the federal government to pay for the medical costs associated with treating undocumented immigrants. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission will: - Direct hospitals and additional identified providers to collect information regarding the cost of medical care provided to undocumented immigrants, beginning by Nov. 1. - Direct covered hospitals to report such data to HHSC quarterly, with initial submissions due March 1, 2025. - Direct those hospitals to inform the patient that federal law mandates that any response to such questions will not affect patient care. - Report annually, beginning on Jan. 1, 2026, to the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, and the Speaker of the House on the preceding year’s costs for medical care provided to undocumented immigrants. The order applies to hospitals enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program as well as any others identified by the HHSC. Harris Health, which runs Ben Taub, LBJ and other county health clinics, told KHOU 11 News that it would comply with the order. KHOU 11 Legal Analyst Carmen Roe said other states and cities have similar laws in place. She also said people in need of care can't be forced to answer a question about immigration status and can't be denied services based on their immigration status. KHOU 11 has reached out to local hospitals to find out if they'll comply as well as the governor's office and Texas Health and Human Services for comment.",

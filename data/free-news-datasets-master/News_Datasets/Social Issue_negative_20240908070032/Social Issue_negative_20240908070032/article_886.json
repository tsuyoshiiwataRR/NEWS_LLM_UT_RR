    "text": "The Harris campaign issued a response to Donald Trump's recent news conference, criticizing the former president for what they described as a 'public meltdown.' The statement from the Harris campaign highlighted Trump's alleged lies, attacks on the media, and excuses for being off the campaign trail. One of the key points raised by the Harris campaign was Trump's absence from the campaign trail, contrasting it with the active campaigning of Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The campaign pointed out that Trump had not campaigned all week and had not visited any swing states, while Harris and Walz were engaging in a battleground campaign blitz. During his news conference, Trump defended his lack of campaigning by stating that he was leading by a significant margin and was allowing the opposition's convention to proceed without interference. This explanation was met with skepticism by the Harris campaign, which implied that Trump's reluctance to campaign was due to other reasons. The back-and-forth between the Harris campaign and Trump underscores the intensity of the ongoing political campaign and the contrasting approaches taken by the two sides. While Trump opted for a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence, Harris and Walz were actively engaging with voters in key battleground states. As the election season progresses, it is likely that such exchanges and criticisms will continue to shape the narrative of the campaign and influence voter perceptions. Both campaigns are expected to intensify their efforts in the coming weeks as they seek to secure support and sway undecided voters.",

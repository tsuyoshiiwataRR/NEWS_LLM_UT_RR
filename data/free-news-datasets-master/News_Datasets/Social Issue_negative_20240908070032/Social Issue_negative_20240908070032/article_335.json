    "text": "Now hear me out on this one.I am not saying the roads in south-west Victoria are not in bad shape.In fact, in some cases they are appalling.But like we often observe, there really is nothing new under the sun.Going back through our archives here at \\u003ci\\u003eThe Standard\\u003c/i\\u003e, we have come across some photographs that show problems with Warrnambool and district roads are an age-old issue.Of course comparing historic passages in time is fraught with danger and like apples and oranges, but these comparisons do provide for some interesting observations.The obvious knock on the people fixing the roads today is they do not stand the test of time, a frustrating thing for the aggrieved as they believe modern technology should make the process faster and more steadfast.But to counteract that, the cost of such modern road making and repairing methods can be exorbitant.Also the amount of cars and trucks traveling on the roads are far greater than they once would have been. \\u003cbr\\u003eThis puts extra strain on the roads, as well as limiting the time available to carry out repairs or road building.CRB stood for Country Roads Board, a body which was created by the Victorian government in 1912 to oversee main roads in the state.Cars were relatively new at this time but poor roads were already a bugbear for many.While more money was put into roads as cars became more common, the CRB remained a whipping boy for those seeking the perfect road to travel on.The CRB stayed alive until 1983, when it was replaced by the Road Construction Authority.In 1989, VicRoads was named as the new authority, a status it still holds today.(We should note at this stage that local councils also hold responsibility for some roads in their municipalities). Like many government authorities, VicRoads cops its share of public scorn.Like many things that have come and long gone, the CRB is sometimes remembered through rose-coloured glasses. But newspaper articles and photos from back in the day show the CRB also suffered from brutal critiquing from the public.In the mid-20\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e century Warrnambool was a growing city and this was always going to challenge the conditions of the roads - whether they be under state or local jurisdiction. An example is the photo on this story which shows a car sunken up to its back axles in October 1974.The accompanying article in\\u003ci\\u003e The Standard\\u003c/i\\u003e said the car had sunk into the road on the corner of Liebig and Lava streets. \\u003cbr\\u003eThe cause of the sinking was blamed on sand laid over the top of new underground pipes. The sand had buckled under the weight of what looked like an old-school Ford family sedan.The fact it happened in Warrnambool's main street in the middle of the day heightened the seriousness of the issue.Maybe all involved retired to the old Grand Hotel (pictured across the road) to discuss the answer to the problem.We should note that one of the big issues with Warrnambool and roads has been the city's drainage.When it rains in Warrnambool in the middle of winter, it just keeps raining, and the photo we have from 1964 shows the damage that can be caused.Water pooling on the middle of Jamieson Street, with a line of school buses driving through it, give the road very little chance to survive unscathed. Lennon Avenue in Warrnambool's west was a goat track in the July of 1956, with this resident pictured above having to get off her bike to get through the mud.But the photo from September 1957 shows it wasn't just winter that caused all the trouble.This access road to Nicholson Street in East Warrnambool is little more than a muddied track, with even the most robust cars of the time having to work hard to get their way through. One of the most used roads in Warrnambool has always been Viaduct Road, a scenic route that gives breathtaking views of the city's beaches.But the road has always had a bit of a reputation for being a little bumpy, and in May 1962, things weren't looking good.\\u003cbr\\u003eOur photo shows the road riddled with potholes that had been filled up by autumn rain. When it comes to the country road surrounding the city, the state of play can be dire.In the news at the moment is a push to upgrade the Cobden-Warrnambool Road, an important thoroughfare that is crying out for some love.\\u003cbr\\u003eBack in October 1991, this road had some even bigger issues than it does today.\\u003cbr\\u003eAs our photo shows, the hole in the road looks like it could extend to the the depths of the earth.\\u003cbr\\u003eInteresting to note the road sign being held warns drivers to slow down.\\u003cbr\\u003eIn a more cautious 2024, that sign would not only be changed to stop, but a full road detour would likely be in place.",

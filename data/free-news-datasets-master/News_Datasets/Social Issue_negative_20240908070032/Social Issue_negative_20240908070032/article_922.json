Elon Musk has deleted a post on X, the social media platform he owns, in which he spread fake news about detainment camps being established in the Falkland Islands. A fake article, mocked up to mimic The Daily Telegraph newspapers style, had been shared on X (formerly Twitter) by the co-leader of Britain First, a far-right political party. The byline added: The camps would be used to detain prisoners from the ongoing riots as the British prison system is already at capacity. ... In a slew of tweets aimed at Starmer over the past week, Musk has questioned whether the riots were taking place in Britain or the Soviet Union and even claimed that civil war is inevitable.

The woman, from near Chester, was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of publishing written material to stir up racial hatred and false communications. She is being held in custody by Cheshire police. ... Sunder Katwala, director of the thinktank British Future, highlighted a number of high-profile online figures, including Laurence Fox and former kickboxer Andrew Tate, who were sharing that false information on X. A number of experts said this misinformation had been used by a vocal minority to sow division and fuel their own agenda and trigger a summer of thrill-seeking impulsive insurrection after violent disorder in the days since the attack.

Background on Britain First: they're fascist. The Wikipedia entry: Britain First is a far-right,[9] British fascist[1] and neo-fascist[2][10] political party and hate group[10][2] formed in 2011 by former members of the British National Party (BNP).[11] The group was founded by Jim Dowson, an anti-abortion and far-right campaigner.[12] The organisation's co-leaders are former BNP councillor Paul Golding and Ashlea Simon.[13][7] Jayda Fransen formerly served as its deputy leader.[14] Britain First campaigns primarily against multiculturalism and what it sees as the Islamisation of the United Kingdom, and advocates the preservation of traditional British culture. It attracted attention by taking direct action such as \"Christian patrols\" and \"invasions\" of British mosques.[11][15] It has been noted for its online activism.[16] ... The party's structure is similar to that of Ulster loyalist groups in Northern Ireland, insofar as the group has a political wing backed up by a paramilitary action force (named \"Britain First Defence Force\" .[citation needed] The action force's members assume titles such as \"provost marshal\", and a document written by Jim Dowson said that \"I have lived in the worst trouble spots of Belfast; I have had high powered machine gun fire rip bricks from my house and have been injured by grenade attack. Sometimes we had to defend our homes from the traditional enemy, other times from the forces of the state, the police and army.\"[21] ... In November 2017, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, caused controversy by re-tweeting three anti-Muslim videos shared by Jayda Fransen. The re-tweets were responded to by Fransen and Paul Golding with the statement \"God Bless you Trump! God Bless America!\".[118][119] Britain First boasted of a surge in support after Trump retweeted its videos.[120] ... In 2023, Golding and Britain First were unblocked on Twitter.[133][134][135] Britain First campaigns primarily against multiculturalism and what it sees as the Islamisation of the United Kingdom, and advocates the preservation of traditional British culture.

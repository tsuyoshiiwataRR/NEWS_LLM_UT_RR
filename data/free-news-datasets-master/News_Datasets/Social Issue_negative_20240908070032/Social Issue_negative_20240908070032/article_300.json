    "text": "The week of Walz continues, and despite being tapped to be the vice presidential nominee, it hasn't been a great one for America's newest dad, as regime media wants you to call him.\nHe's a normie, media claims. He's just like every middle-aged male in Middle America, they'll tell you. It took about 48 hours before the real Tim Walz began to be revealed, despite media's best intentions to roll him out in the most positive light possible.\nKeep in mind how the week unfolded. Walz, who is not Jewish, became the backup plan for Kamala Harris, and this is how George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America reacted.\nBecause Joe Biden was pushed to the curb by Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and the Democratic Party elite, Kamala Harris and the DNC were put in the unenviable position of having to throw together an emergency ticket without the benefit of any serious vetting process.\nVetting, by the way, isn't just running the traps on a potential candidate's financial records, possible criminal skeletons in the closet, or any other political unexploded ordinance that could be used as opposition research for the other party, though that is definitely a big part of vetting.\nWhat I'm talking about is the vetting that comes as the result of running a primary campaign. Typically, a candidate files for office, announces their candidacy, and then begins a grueling and expensive tour around the country to earn votes of citizens from their party. Those votes are earned by how they acquit themselves in town hall appearances, debates, media interviews, press conferences, rallies, and fundraisers. Kamala Harris engaged in exactly none of that for the 2024 cycle. She leapfrogged over all the vetting that would 'out' problems with campaigns that normally keep them from becoming successful.\nIf Biden had been pushed out a year ago, Kamala Harris would no doubt have run for president. She would probably have been the frontrunner at the outset, and she very well might have won the primary outright. But she almost certainly would have had competition from Bernie Sanders, Gavin Newsom, and possibly a whole host of up-and-comers in the party that would have viewed Donald Trump as vulnerable, and Harris as unelectable due to her not being able to robustly defend the Biden record, much less her own. But the process of the primaries would have sorted all this out.\nWalz has gone through no vetting whatsoever, other than to check off the 'non-Jew' box. So what happens when the dirt begins to pile up on all facets of the Tim Walz story? The Harris campaign is AWOL. They aren't engaged and pushing back directly. If Walz actually had been vetted, the campaign would have known ahead of time what lines of attack would come, and they would be ready for it. They're radio silent.\nYamiche Alcindor, who is among the most left-leaning members of media, said this to Kristen Welker on MSNBC.\nOther stand-in surrogates have been caught flat-footed, and maybe none more so than Tina Smith, who I've been told is actually a senator from Minnesota. Who knew? Here's her appearance trying to deflect from the Walz stolen valor scandal on CNN.\nWhen you're trying to play military service whataboutism with J.D. Vance and you get fact-checked by Jim Acosta of all people, you know the Democrats aren't fully in command of their messaging. Van Jones even acknowledged this stolen valor story is going to be a problem.\nSo because Kamala didn't vet Walz, other than how close to her liberal ideology he appears to be, and, of course, the fact that he's not Jewish, there's been a torrent of material released online about the Minnesota governor. And it's not just on the stolen valor story, which we'll come back to in a little bit. The attacks on Walz can be classified into three buckets: Personal/character flaws, views and policy and issue sets, and his record as governor of the Gopher State.\nOn the personal and character front, as a 31-year-old teacher and professed high school football coach, Walz was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, testing well over the .08 limit in Minnesota, and was clocked driving 96mph in a 55mph zone. What makes the story worse is his campaign tried to get out from under it by claiming he was deaf and didn't understand what the state trooper was trying to tell him, deafness caused by his artillery service.\nIt's not true. He wasn't deaf, he wasn't an artilleryman, and it turns out he wasn't even the head football coach he claimed to be. He was an assistant coach . So he appears to have commited stolen coaching valor as well.\nAt the White House a week after Joe Biden's politically fatal debate performance with Donald Trump, Tim Walz in his role as chairman of the Democratic Governors Association led a delegation to ascertain first-hand whether Biden was still fit for office or not. His conclusion?\nAnd to compound the lie in which he was participating as part of the left-wing cover-up of Biden's decline, he went on further to gaslight those bringing it up Biden's decline as ageism.\nTim Walz is a man who lies with extraordinary ease. At the Minnesota State Fair, Walz claimed kids only missed 10 days of school during the pandemic lockdown.\nOf course, he shut down schools in March of 2020, and most of the schools did not go back to in-person learning until February, 2021, 11 months later. He's just lying to you. He does that a lot.\nOn the issues, he's every bit as radical as Kamala Harris is. On gender reassignment surgeries for children, he's militant.\nOn abortion, he boasts that he's more pro-choice than Nancy Pelosi.\nOn immigration, he's an open borders guy who actually used taxpayer money to set up an office for illegal migrants to have funding and assistance in order to integrate with the people already here legally.\nWalz apparently wants our Navy to be powered on algae.\nOn virtually every issue, Tim Walz is as advertised - a progressive. He's not the centrist media is presenting. Here's Walz in his own words.\nAs governor, his track record is disastrous. Here's one ad just about letting Minneapolis burn for a week during the 2020 George Floyd riots.\nWalz signed legislation redefining sexual orientation to include proclivities that would make Caligula blush. A Republican lawmaker tried to include a clause that would make adult-youth sexual preference an exception to the human rights protections provided as part of the bill. Democrats threw out that amendment, meaning grown-ups sexually attracted to kids are now a protected sexual orientation. Walz signed it into law.\nAdvertisement Governor Tim Walz redefined “sexual orientation” to include pedophiles.\nWalz did so by signing law that removed @HarryNiska ’s amendment to excluded “physical or sexual attachment to children by an adult” from the state human rights law.\nHere is Rep. Niska’s floor speech: pic.twitter.com/riRVxemGZX\n— Dustin Grage (@GrageDustin) August 7, 2024 The 'Mind Your Own Damn Business' governor is also the one who instituted a snitch line during the pandemic so that your neighbors, otherwise known as one man's socialist, could rat you out.\nThe Democratic Party may be where Tim Walz and Kamala Harris are residing - the far-left of the political spectrum. But the country as a whole is not. The country is very much a split country, and the last two presidential elections have been decided by razor-thin margins in swing states.\nThis is why the stolen valor story could be so devastating to the Harris-Walz campaign. I did not serve. It's not for me to judge whether Walz' behavior, actions, and rhetoric since his time in the National Guard constitute stolen valor. What I can tell you is how the veteran community are reacting to the scandal thus far, and how badly the campaign has handled the story, cementing in the perception in the veteran community that Walz has for years claimed honor, rank, and service of which he is not due.\nThe number of veterans in Walz' company speaking out that served contemporaneously with him are growing in number, and none of them have anything good to say about his bailing out early. We had one such member who was blinded and suffered TBI (Traumatic Brain Injuries) on his deployment to Iraq, a deployment Walz chose to avoid, call into the Hugh Hewitt Show Thursday with guest host Mark Davis.\nTim Walz hasn't addressed this controversy personally. He hasn't taken one question on it, has offered no explanation. And he's kind of in a box right now, because it would be awkward for him to agree to an interview when Kamala Harris has refused to do so for 19 days. Harris surrogates are floundering in the meantime, and the veteran community, a very tight-knit one, is circulating this story with updates and newly-unearthed videos. And outside of Pothole Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden's Transportation Secretary and a veteran, I've yet to see one retired service member of any branch downplaying this scandal as no big deal.\nSo does this matter? Remember me mentioning thin margins and such? In 2020, 43,000 votes over three states - Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin, decided the election for Biden. How many veterans live in the swing states? Federal data as of 2022 shows:\nMichigan - 461,809\nWisconsin - 283,767\nPennsylvania - 638,436\nArizona - 454,620\nGeorgia - 678,304\nNevada - 205,615\nNorth Carolina - 620,969.\nThat's 3,343,520 veterans over seven states. Granted, not all of them vote, and definitely not all of them are Republicans. But what made the Swift Boat campaign against John Kerry in 2004 so effective? It was the perception that set in, and the charges originating from both Democrat and Republican retired service members. It was bipartisan, and it resonated with the military veteran community the more time passed. Walz' silence risks the snowballing of this scandal into something that can no longer be managed. Look again at that number - 3.3 million and change. That's a big number. Think you can make the case that 50,000 of them might sour on the ticket because someone they perceive as committing stolen valor is on it?\nWalz really only has one card to play, and he has to play it quickly. He has to sit down for an interview and offer a mea culpa. He has to give a believable argument that he had a young family and didn't want to go, and so yes, he took early retirement to avoid going. He's got to own up to it and offer some justification, any justification, for why. And it has to be the truth, because if he lies about his mea culpa and gets caught, the Walz Veep boomlet will be over before it really got started. But he has to do an interview. But again, how does the vice presidential nominee agree to an in-depth interview when the presidential nominee can't and/or won't?\nConcluding where I began, with the lack of vetting problem, let's say the scandal does get worse over the next two weeks, and Walz on the ticket becomes untenable. He might be forced to withdraw from the ticket, saying the election is too important to be a distraction. What then?\nWell, unlike the Republican National Convention, where the GOP delegates all cast a positive vote for J.D. Vance to be the vice presidential nominee on the first night, there was no such vote with the DNC delegates.\nIn order to comply with Ohio laws on qualifying for the ballot, the delegates convened by conference call and nominated Kamala Harris for president last week before she had picked Walz as her number two. The delegates gave Harris and the party a blank check, in essence, by voting to approve whomever the vice president would eventually be. So If Walz has to back out, Harris and the DNC can simply go back to the 'not-Jew' well for whomever they think the media will fall in love with next and go with that.\nThen, of course, the vetting cycle online begins anew.\nAll, of course, in the name of muh democracy.\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Arkansas, Missouri rank in top 32 states for underage vape usage WEST PLAINS, Mo. (KY3) - Arkansas and Missouri ranked mid-pack in states with underage use of vapes. A recent study by [DrugWatch.com](https://www.drugwatch.com/e-cigarettes/vape-stat-by-state/) showed Arkansas ranked 20th and Missouri ranked 32nd for underage vape usage. Howell County Sheriff Brent Campbell explained it’s a problem for schools in the area. “They say if a vape is seized early in the day, you can see who does or doesn’t do it by just the reaction of a need, or nervousness, or the anxiety type symptoms they would display,” Sheriff Campbell said. The sheriff explained the devices are getting smaller by the day, making it harder for adults to see. “It was almost a contest to see how well you can conceal a device, and now it’s inverted into the vaping world,” Sheriff Campbell stated. From a health standpoint, vaping even just once can cause irreparable damage to someone underage. If it’s labeled saying it doesn’t contain nicotine, it’s likely it still does. “Even if it’s labeled as being an e-juice type flavored product, they’re still getting some nicotine in it, which is harmful,” Ozarks Healthcare Family Nurse Practitioner Julie Gunter said. An unwelcomed trend healthcare providers are seeing in underage vapers is bronchiolitis obliterans, or popcorn lung. “Damage to the lung tissue by the chemicals that are in the vape itself. You can cause some scarring of the lung tissue that is not reversible,” Gunter explained. As more and more kids begin to vape, programs are trying to stop those underage vapers before it’s too late. Truth Initiative has a texting program for teens and young adults. By texting DITCHVAPE to 88709, you can receive free support to help stop vaping. “It’s tailored by age, by the device type that someone is trying to quit, and tailored around their quit date. The program moves with them as they move through their quitting journey,” Truth Initiative Chief Health Officer Dr. Amanda Graham stated. If you need to dispose of a vape, you shouldn’t throw it in the everyday household trash. Due to the device’s lithium battery, it could be dangerous. Instead, find your local hazardous household waste disposal site. To report a correction or typo, please email [digitalnews@ky3.com](mailto:digitalnews@ky3.com).

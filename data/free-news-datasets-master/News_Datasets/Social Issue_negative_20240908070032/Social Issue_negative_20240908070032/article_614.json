    "text": "Mumbai: The ongoing demolition work of the century Sion Road Over Bridge (ROB) has led to significant traffic congestion in the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) area. As vehicular movement from adjacent roads has surged, delays and bottlenecks have become prevalent. The Mumbai Traffic Police have implemented several temporary traffic management measures to alleviate the situation from Thursday.\nAccording to a traffic department official, “Due to the demolition work on Sion ROB, traffic coming from Sion Railway Station to Kalanagar has been diverted. Consequently, there has been a significant increase in vehicular traffic on BKC roads, particularly those approaching from the BKC Connector Bridge and M.T.N.L. Junction, leading to congestion. We have implemented additional measures starting August 8 to manage the traffic more effectively.”\nFPJ Shorts 'Would Have Brought Entire Party Along': NCP Leader Ajit Pawar Comments At CM Eknath Shinde’s Book Launch Mumbai: 20-Year-Old Nursery Teacher Assaults Central Railway TCs At Ghatkopar Station Over Ticket Issue Pydhonie Murder Case: Wife And Lover Conspired To Kill Victim; Crime Discussed In Sign Language Mumbai: EOW Registers FIR Against GA Builders And Others For Delayed Redevelopment Of Sneh Sadan In Chembur As part of these measures, passenger buses, including BEST services, are now rerouted. Buses traveling from BKC road towards the BKC area will bypass N.S.E. Junction, Bharat Nagar Junction, NABARD Junction, and Diamond Junction. Instead, they will turn right at Platina Junction to reach their destinations within BKC. Other vehicular routes in the area have also been adjusted to help alleviate the traffic load.\nThe demolition is part of a larger project to expand railway infrastructure to accommodate new 5th and 6th lines between Kurla and CSMT. Railway sources have indicated that the tendering process for the demolition and reconstruction has been completed, with the demolition and re- construction work expected to be finished in nearly two years.\nDespite these measures, many motorists have expressed frustration with the traffic management. On 'X', formerly known as Twitter, Jimith Sheth criticized the traffic control, noting the inefficiencies and delays. He highlighted ongoing issues at other locations, such as Mumbai Central Bridge, which have compounded traffic problems.\nAnother user on 'X' reported severe congestion on Dharavi’s 60 Feet Road, exacerbated by parked buses and trucks. The user also noted that the right turn at the circle opposite Sion Hospital's new OPD has been blocked, further adding to the chaos.\nNew traffic management order of city traffic police effective from Thursday\nNo Entry Route ----\nVehicular traffic coming from M.M.R.D.A. office Jio World Street 1- right turn at Family Court Junction to move on BKC road towards N.S.E.

    "text": "By Bill Trotter ,\n24 minutes ago Public access to a federal fish hatchery in Orland might have to be restricted because of vandalism at the site, according to officials.\nCraig Brook Fish Hatchery , which the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service operates on Alamoosook Lake, is used for spawning and rearing protected Atlantic salmon that are stocked in seven rivers in Maine. It also has amenities on Alamoosook Lake and adjacent Craig Pond such as boat ramps, picnic areas and trails that are open to the public during daylight hours.\nRecent vandalism has “made it a challenge to ensure these areas are safe and welcoming for the public,” hatchery officials said. The hatchery does not have staff or resources to monitor these areas, they said, and so is appealing to the public for help in keeping them clean, accessible and functional.\nUp until 2020, access gates were locked each night at 8 p.m. to prevent campfires and vandalism, among other things, but the facilities have been more accessible since then.\n“Since roads have been un-gated, there have been multiple instances of these prohibited activities, resulting in the need to close the bathhouses in favor of portable units,” hatchery officials said in a statement. “If these illegal activities continue, we will have to restrict or manage access to the public use areas of the station.”\nShannon Moss, spokesperson for Maine State Police, said troopers investigated a complaint at the hatchery this spring in which someone spray painted on stand-alone restrooms and outbuildings on the property.\n“Given there were no cameras, no timeline, or idea from employees on who could have done this, there was little to go on,” Moss said. “The case is now closed.”\nThe federal agency might again start locking gates on the property at 8 p.m., service officials said. They urged anyone with information about the vandalism to contact the hatchery or the Hancock County Sheriff’s Office.\nThe federal agency did not respond to messages seeking additional information.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

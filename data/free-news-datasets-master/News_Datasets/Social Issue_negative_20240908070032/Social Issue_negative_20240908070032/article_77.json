    "text": "On August 8, 2024 (KST), rapper Lee Young Ji shared an exciting tweet—and other social media updates—announcing the return of her beloved YouTube show, My Alcohol Diary (also known as No Prepare ).\nInstagram에서 이 게시물 보기\n차린건 쥐뿔도 없지만(@youngji_gbbul_nocharim)님의 공유 게시물\nThe third season of the sool-bang , or “drinking show,” was first teased in June, though without set dates.\nLee Young Ji’s “No Prepare” Is Reportedly Gearing Up For Season 3\nSo, naturally, some viewers celebrated Lee Young Ji’s tweet confirming the return. Idol fans, and even celebrities themselves, flocked to the comments signing up to guest on the next season.\n차쥐뿔 돌아왔다\n술먹자 상차려라\n— 이영지 (@dokgodieinsaeng) August 8, 2024\nMy Alcohol Diary is back. Set the table, let’s drink.\n— Lee Young Ji\n안녕하세요. 저는 SF9의 인성입니다.\n차쥐뿔 너무나 즐겁게 잘 보고 있고요 저의 힐링프로그램입니다.\n에펜씨 다니고 시키는거 다해요 (주종 안가림, 양질의 토크 가능)\n행복한 목요일 되시길 바라며…🤩 #SF9 #INSEONG\n— SF9official (@SF9official) August 8, 2024\nHello, I’m SF9’s Inseong. I love My Alcohol Diary so much. It’s a program that heals me. I work at FNC and I’m willing to do whatever I’m told to do. (Can drink whatever, can talk about whatever.) I hope you have a great Thursday…\n— SF9’s Inseong\n안녕하세요 영지님 저는 송건희입니다\n제가 차쥐뿔 정말 사랑하는데요?\n혹시 상 차리면 달려가도 될까요?\n저요 제발 저요 저 아니면 안 돼요 제발요 저요 저 진짜 영지님 실물 영접 하고 싶습니다 저요 제발요\n— 송건희 (@nageonheeeeya) August 8, 2024\nHello, Young Ji. This is Song Geon Hee. I really love My Alcohol Diary . When the table is set, may I come over? Please pick me. If not me, then who? Please. I really want to meet you in person, too. Pick me, please.\n— Song Geon Hee\n영지님\n술 사갈게요\n톱스타 만들어주세요\n— 하성운 (@gooreumseng) August 8, 2024\nDear Young Ji. I’ll bring the alcohol. Please turn me into a superstar.\n— Ha Sung Woon\nOn the other hand, though, some viewers expressed uncertainty—especially given the “timing” of recent DUI scandal involving the BTS member Suga .\n| theqoo “The timing, though.” “Dear Young Ji… I like My Alcohol Diary , but how about postponing or drinking tea instead?” “It didn’t even seem like she drinks well, so I wish she wouldn’t drink for the sake of her health…” “I’d prefer it if she ate food instead of drinking alcohol.” “I’d say her show is the original sool-bang , but there are too many drinking shows now. It’s harmful. It should be restricted to 19+.” “Is she obtuse…? People have been talking because of the DUI scandal that broke a day before. Young Ji is generally a good person, but she simply will not listen when the topic of drinking comes up. Maybe because My Alcohol Diary is so popular.” “Stop with the drinking shows already.” “No, no. Stop with the alcohol!” “Ugh, I hate drinking shows.” “I mean, an age restriction would solve the problem rather than removing the content itself. There are countless more problematic shows out there, but it feels like Young Ji’s show is being targeted right now. If this is to be removed, YouTube would have to remove all alcohol-related content on the platform. Is that possible?” “The show name doesn’t even include alcohol, but drinking seems to be almost its identity… Why? How about just eating food…? Like people do… Or drinking coffee or traditional tea would be nice, too.” “Young Ji is NOT the one who caused trouble after drinking, so why are people picking on her show?” “Can she not host the show if she doesn’t get drunk?” Over the years, in general, Korea has seen concerns be raised over the increasing popularity of drinking shows.\nConcerns Are Raised Over The Increasing Popularity Of Idol Drinking Shows\nMeanwhile, an episode of My Alcohol Diary featuring a girl group member was crowned the top-ranking YouTube video in Korea for 2023.

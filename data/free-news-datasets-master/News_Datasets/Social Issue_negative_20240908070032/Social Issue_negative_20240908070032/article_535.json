    "text": "By Robert Schroeder\nTrump's call for more say over Federal Reserve decisions would go against the tradition of the central bank being independent of politics\nFormer President Donald Trump on Thursday called for a greater say in Federal Reserve decision-making, claiming that the central bank has \"gotten it wrong a lot.\"\nIn a news conference from Mar-a-Lago, his residence in Florida, Trump, who is the Republican nominee for president, cited his business experience and said he has \"better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,\" Jerome Powell.\n\"I feel the president should have at least [a] say in there,\" Trump said.\nTrump was frequently critical of Powell - whom he picked to lead the Fed - during his term as president.\nTrump's call for more say over Fed decisions would go against the tradition of the central bank being independent of politics. On July 31, Powell answered a question about the possibility of cutting interest rates in September and remaining apolitical by saying, in part: \"We don't change anything in our approach to address other factors like the political calendar. Congress has, we believe, ordered us to conduct our business in a nonpolitical way at all times, not just some of the time.\"\nLast spring, a Wall Street Journal report detailed how Trump's allies were drafting proposals that would attempt to erode the Fed's independence if he were to win another term in the White House. Economists and other analysts panned the proposals outlined in the story, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen argued the case for Fed independence in a speech shortly after the article appeared.\nAfter Powell's July 31 news conference following the most recent Fed meeting, economists said a rate cut in September looks like a done deal. Wall Street was occupied earlier this week with the possibility of an interim rate cut before the Fed's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting, as MarketWatch's Joy Wiltermuth reports. But jobless-claims data released Thursday made such a dramatic move unlikely, according to at least one analyst.\nNow read: Fed rate-cut fervor is gripping Wall Street again. That could set markets up for another trap.\n-Robert Schroeder\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "text": "It’s difficult to respond to Eric Olenick’s recent letter because it is so fundamentally wrong. It is so inaccurate, in fact, that it seems to have been written entirely as a provocation rather than an attempt to remotely characterize any facts. Genetic variations in sex chromosomes have been known for nearly 100 years. Before that, in 1905, Nettie Stevens made observations that led to the XY determination system. At first, (and perhaps ironically) her research and findings about sex determination were not appreciated, nor believed, because of the gender bias in science. This is all old news. I am surprised that, in forming his deeply held opinion, Mr Olenick has not run across the research and Nobel Prize-winning work that has informed our current knowledge base. It’s all there in Wikipedia, for those not inclined or trained to analyze the medical literature. Or, perhaps this is the kind of knowledge gap that can occur when science is taught, or learned, at home. — Nicolas Wieder Anchorage Have something on your mind?

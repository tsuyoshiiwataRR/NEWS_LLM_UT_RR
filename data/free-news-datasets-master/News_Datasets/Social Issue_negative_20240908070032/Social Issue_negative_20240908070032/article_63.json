Walz left a few months before the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion was sent to Iraq.\n“As far as I know, he did not know,” Eustice said of whether Walz knew about the upcoming deployment. “At that time, there were all kinds of rumors about us deploying. In May, when he decided to retire … we had no ‘Notice of Deployment.’ That didn’t come until July,” he added.\nHe left in May and the deployment came in July. Come on vets. You know it’s not written in stone until you get “ ORDERS” . Have you all forgotten how the military works ?? There all talk of deployments. Always had those uniforms ready to go, just in case. You practice all the time for it,,, but until it hits. It doesn’t\nSad what politics do to the supposed “brothers”. Nothing burger is right. We also know that we do not see an up tempo of staffing, with people being shuffled in, along with the intense training schedules. Field and general officers do not visit a unit to give pep talks, and we are all required to fill out a new will, power of attorney etc.... if we are not aware that we are going to be deployed.\nOf course the military keeps the exact date of deployment a secret, but everyone knows that the deployment is inevitable.",

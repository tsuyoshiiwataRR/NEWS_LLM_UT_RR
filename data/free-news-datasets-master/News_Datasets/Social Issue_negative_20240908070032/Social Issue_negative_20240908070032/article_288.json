    "text": "Please fill out the fields below so we can help you better. Note: you must provide your domain name to get help. Domain names for issued certificates are all made public in Certificate Transparency logs (e.g. crt.sh | example.com), so withholding your domain name here does not increase secrecy, but only makes it harder for us to provide help.\nMy domain is:minatepret.com\nI ran this command: sudo certbot certonly --dns-cloudflare --dns-cloudflare-credentials=C:/Users/ahmet/OneDrive/Belgeler/CERT/credentials.ini --dns-google-propagation-seconds 120 --email --agree-tos --non-interactive --expand --domains minatepret.com,www.minatepret.com\nIt produced this output: Ä± dont remember but not working\nMy web server is (include version):Apache2.4\nThe operating system my web server runs on is (include version):Windows11\nMy hosting provider, if applicable, is: Self host\nI can login to a root shell on my machine (yes or no, or I don't know): yes\nI'm using a control panel to manage my site (no, or provide the name and version of the control panel): no\nThe version of my client is (e.g. output of certbot --version or certbot-auto --version if you're using Certbot):certbot 1.21.0\ncertbot --version\ncertbot-auto --version\nAnd command give a ai. I am really new this place so I don't know. I'm trying to solve it with ai.\nSomething doesn't seem right.\nYeah, leader, I'm so confused because of that stupid ai.\nAlso, why do you need a globally signed cert for FQDNs that resolve to RFC-1918 IPs and NXD:\nName: minatepret.com\nAddress: 192.168.1.194\nwww.minatepret.com: Non-existent domain\nIt might be simpler to create your own self-signed cert and just trust that [locally].\nit's like a hobby for some fun purposes just to see the https, but other than that I'm unfamiliar with many terms\nSounds like you are in the testing phase.\nPlease use the test/staging environment for all testing.\nYou shouldn't be using certbot.\nOn Windows you should use certify the web, win-acme, posh-acme, or some other Windows specific client.\nokey Ä± try\nTry:\n[very simple to use]\nUntil you have HTTP access to your system, you will have to use DNS authentication.\nFYI, there is no google seen in that part [only cloudflare]:\nminatepret.com nameserver = magali.ns.cloudflare.com\nminatepret.com nameserver = kianchau.ns.cloudflare.com\nyes i use cloudflare\nAre you going to use Cloudflare CDN?\n[to access your site(s) over the Internet]\nyes i use\nThen I would recommend that you use their certs.\nIs it made directly from the dash",

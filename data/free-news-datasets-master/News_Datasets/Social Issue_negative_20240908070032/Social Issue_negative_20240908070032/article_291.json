On average, survival benefits of CPR for cardiac arrest could be three times as high for white adults compared to Black adults and twice as high for men compared to women. “It’s not just about whether bystander CPR was done, but was it done well for everyone so that, irrespective of race, ethnicity or sex, everyone can derive the same level of benefit from someone starting CPR?” said lead researcher [Dr. Paul Chan](/doctor/paul-s-chan-md), a cardiologist at [Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute](/locations/saint-lukes-mid-america-heart-institute).

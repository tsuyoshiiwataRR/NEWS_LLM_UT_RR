    "text": "I agree that both the Legislature and the governor have acted like ostriches with their heads in the sand when it comes to dealing with Alaska’s fiscal future. But not for the reason given by the Anchorage Daily News editorial board. It was not an oil price drop in 2014 that caused Alaska’s drop in oil revenue; instead, it was a change in tax revenue. In fiscal 2013 and 2014, the yearly price for oil was close to the same. Oil production in 2014 was slightly up, by about 2,000 barrels per day. The cause was SB 21. We lost $1.4 billion in oil taxes simply because of a huge tax giveaway to some of the richest corporations on the planet. Alaska has three legacy fields that produce 90% of our state’s output that are the most profitable in North America. Yet the effective tax rate is by far the lowest. Any long-term fiscal plan for the state needs to start with ending the oil tax giveaway, not with restructuring how we use the Permanent Fund to pay for government. The truth about how we got here is essential to the real story. — Harry Crawford Former state legislator Anchorage Have something on your mind?

    "text": "Garbage accumulates in Gaza, contaminating water supplies and raising the risk of polio. The World Health Organization (WHO) plans to send over 1.2 million polio vaccines to Gaza after the virus was detected in wastewater at multiple locations.\nWHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Wednesday that the presence of polio virus in wastewater is a “tell-tale” sign that polio is circulating in the war-stricken zone. Unvaccinated children under 5 years are at highest risk for contracting the highly infectious disease, the WHO chief said.\nThe agency is now gearing up to vaccinate 600,000 children under 8 in two rounds, starting on August 17.\n“There is a high risk of spreading of the circulating vaccine-derived polio virus in Gaza, not only because of the detection but because of the very dire situation with the water sanitation,” said Ayadil Saparbekov, team lead for health emergencies at WHO in Gaza and the West Bank via video link from Jerusalem.\nGaza’s health authority has declared the territory a “polio epidemic zone,” blaming the virus’s presence on Israel’s continued military attacks and the subsequent destruction of health facilities. Israel’s military has begun vaccinating its personnel against polio.\nOnly 16 of the territory’s 36 hospitals are partially functional , according to the WHO.\nConflict leaves Gazan children lacking routine immunizations Administering oral polio vaccine – Gaza’s vaccination rates have dropped sharply. Before the war, polio immunization rates in Gaza and the occupied West Bank territories approached 99% – considered optimal by the WHO. They have plummeted in the 10 months since the fighting began.\nThe WHO said barriers to vaccination include “lack of security, access obstruction, constant population displacement, shortages of medical supplies, poor quality of water and weakened sanitation ”.\nSaparbekov described dire sanitary conditions across the enclave, with many people living in shelters with one toilet for 600 people and little access to safe drinking water.\nThe polio virus spreads through contact with an infected person’s feces. It can cause paralysis and sometimes death.\nThe fight against polio, considered a crowning achievement in global health, has seen cases plummet by over 99.9% since 1988. The outbreak in Gaza underscores the fragility of this progress.\nConflict causes polio to “thrive” Polio has been detected in two locations in the Gaza strip. Tedros said the discovery of polio in Gaza’s wastewater samples amid the destruction isn’t surprising. Recent wars in Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan led to devastating polio outbreaks , paralyzing underimmunized children. Afghanistan and Pakistan, the last two countries with wild polio, continue to struggle with repeated outbreaks due to humanitarian crises.\n“We have seen polio thrive in places hit by conflict and instability,” wrote Dr Tedros in a recent article.\n“[It is] just a matter of time before it reaches the thousands of children who have been left unprotected,” the WHO chief warned.\nGaza’s decimated health and sanitation systems have set back routine immunizations not just for polio, but also measles, hepatitis A , and meningococcal meningitis. People in the territory are also suffering from high levels of diarrheal diseases , lice, scabies, and skin diseases from the ever-worsening sanitary conditions.\n“The waste management system in Gaza has collapsed,” Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency that assists Palestine, said on Twitter. “Sewage discharges on the streets while people queue for hours just to go to the toilets…make a dangerous recipe for diseases to spread.”\nLack of ceasefire threatens vaccine delivery Six environmental samples of variant poliovirus type 2 have been detected from Khan Younis and Deir al Balah in #Gaza . No paralytic cases have been detected.\n@WHO , the Ministry of Health, @UNICEF , @UNRWA and partners are conducting a risk assessment on the scope of poliovirus…\n— Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) July 19, 2024\nDelivering 1.2 million doses of polio vaccines to Gaza’s children is a “huge logistical challenge,” said WHO technical officer Andrea King. Polio vaccines require stable refrigeration – a challenge even in peacetime\nThe UN reports ongoing obstacles to aid delivery, including “hostilities, unexploded ordnance, damaged and impassable roads, attacks on aid convoys, a lack of public order and safety, and not enough border crossings.”\nDr Tedros emphasized the agency needs “absolute freedom of movement for health workers and medical equipment to carry out these complex operations safely and effectively” in order “to protect children in Gaza from polio.”\n“A ceasefire is essential to allow an effective response,” he said.\nImage Credits: UNRWA , Global Polio Eradication Initiative , UNRWA .",

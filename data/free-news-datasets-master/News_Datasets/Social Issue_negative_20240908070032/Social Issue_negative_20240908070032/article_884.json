    "text": "Many shops were shut down out of fear of looting and vandalism, as police and protesters played a tense game of cat and mouse throughout the day. The city saw a few civilians caught up in the chaos, with most streets deserted and travellers stranded for hours due to a lack of transport. Riot police set up roadblocks at key roundabouts, including Nyayo Stadium, Roysambu, City Stadium, and Ngara, to prevent suspected protesters from entering the CBD, which was the focal point of the demonstrations. Passengers heading into the city faced major delays, with some being forced to disembark and show their identification cards before continuing their journey. “I came all the way from Naivasha to join my fellow patriots determined to send a strong message of our disappointment with the government,” said Antony Njuguna.

Sammy Radak, a human rights activist, said Ruto had failed to honour the pledges he made when he dismissed the Cabinet and promised to transform his government. Kitengela town in Kajiado County, which has been the epicentre of the anti-government protests, did not explode yesterday. Unlike the other days, the much-hyped ‘Nane Nane’ protests did not take place as was witnessed before. It emerged that a meeting with the county security committee that ordered all bars and entertainment outlets to close at 11pm helped calm the town. The committee chaired by County Commissioner James Taari banned protests along the Nairobi-Namanga-Arusha Highway. On Wednesday, Governor Joseph Ole Lenku said that Kitengela and Ongata Rongai would remain on high alert. “As much as we respect the right of any Kenyan to demonstrate, Kitengela and, indeed, any urban centre in Kajiado will not be looting grounds,” he said. Guard their properties But there was tension in the town as traders and residents stood by their shops to guard their properties. Police faced a rough time stopping pockets of protestors from accessing the town centre and blocking the highway. Motorists accessing the town were not allowed to pass mounted roadblocks on both entries from Mombasa Road and Namanga. Notably, petrol stations and supermarkets that were targeted before remained shut to prevent further losses. Makueni, Machakos and Kitui also experienced low-key protests. In Kitui, a handful of protesters waving twigs and placards made a procession from Kalundu market through the town centre where they castigated President William Ruto for turning a deaf ear on demands made by Gen-Zs. “Our issues range from lowering the high cost of living, creation of jobs for the youth, and youth representation in government. These have not been addressed. Instead what we have witnessed is the appointment of ODM retirees into government,” said a protester who identified himself as Mathias. The demonstrators took issue with what they called Ruto’s calculated move to marginalise the Kamba community by denying it Cabinet slots. In Machakos town, many businesses remained closed with leading supermarkets forced to close shop at around 3 pm. Hawkers who operate along the Machakos-Wote highway also vacated the area after it turned into a battleground between the police and protesters.

    "text": "Free lunch funding cut from two Holyoke catholic schools HOLYOKE, Mass. (WGGB/WSHM) - Western Mass News is getting answers after a letter sent home to parents of two Holyoke catholic schools told families they can no longer provide free breakfast and lunch to students for the 2024/2025 school year. The letter outlines that the Mater Dolorosa and the Blessed Sacrament Schools received info from Holyoke Public Schools that the cut was made due to budgeting issues and negative data collection from the two catholic schools. Now, families who were utilizing the school’s free food program will have to find a way to fund kids’ meals. “During a meeting on July 31st, we were informed that both Mater Dolorosa and Blessed Sacrament School no longer qualify for free breakfast and lunch for the 2024/2025 school year. It was explained to us that this change is due to budgeting as well as negative data collection from both schools,” the letter stated. Further on in the letter, Springfield Superintendent of Diocesan Schools said in part: “After consultation with our office staff and Fr. Albert, we have come to a decision to discontinue the breakfast program due to logistics. We cannot diligently monitor the breakfast program daily, as breakfast items were delivered automatically based on total enrollment of students versus a daily lunch count scenario.” Now, families of the Mater Dolorosa and the Blessed Sacrament schools who were utilizing the program will now have pay $4.88 per lunch to continue to receive food through Holyoke Public Schools. Sodexo Group runs the meals program for Holyoke Public Schools, which also includes Mater Dolorosa and Blessed Sacrament. Sodexo told us today to reach out to the school district for a response as to why free breakfast and lunch was cut from these schools. We have yet to hear back. Copyright 2024.

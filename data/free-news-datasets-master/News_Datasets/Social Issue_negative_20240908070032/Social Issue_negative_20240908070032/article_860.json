    "text": "It is worrisome that Britain has been engulfed in a series of violent attacks by far-right, anti-immigrant agitators. Counter-protesters have also shown up. The riots were caused by disinformation and rumours that three children were stabbed to death by a Muslim immigrant ( [Disinformation stokes Islamophobic rage in wake of Southport killings](/world/europe/disinformation-stokes-uk-far-right-islamophobic-rage-in-wake-of-southport-killings), Aug 6). I empathise with the fears and panic of immigrants, especially Muslims. Singaporeans have been advised to avoid the riot areas and keep safe while in England. Racial harmony must never be taken for granted. Rather, it must be protected at all costs. To witness a country erupting into racist violence between communities and attacks on immigrants because of false narratives is unacceptable. As Singapore celebrates its 59th year of nation-building, the anti-immigrant protests in Britain serve as a solemn reminder of the hard-earned social harmony among our different races. Political leaders must refrain from promoting anti-immigrant sentiments to get votes. Winning an election but losing a harmonious society is not worth it. We must also firmly reject any call to segregate us into “new” or “old” Singaporeans. The country needs all races and new migrants to cooperate to secure a brighter future for the next generation. Singapore is like a piece of delicate porcelain which, if broken, will never be the same again. Foo Sing Kheng",

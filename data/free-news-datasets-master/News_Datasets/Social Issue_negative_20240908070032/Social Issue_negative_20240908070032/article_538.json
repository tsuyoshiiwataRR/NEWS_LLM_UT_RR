    "text": "Thomas Jolly, the homosexual activist who insulted Christians with his opening ceremony antics, is ready to roll out the closing ceremony. It is scheduled to begin August 11 at 3:00 p.m. ET.\nThere will be the traditional athletes’ parade and medal ceremony. It will be held indoors at France’s national stadium, involving hundreds of singers, performers, acrobats, dancers and circus artists. Jolly says it is his “ambition” to “celebrate in suspended time, with conscience, and with the idea that together we can make a difference.”\nHow he will suspend time remains a mystery. But at least it is being done with a conscience, which is better than the alternative.\nJolly has already made a difference. He has joined the ranks of anti-Christian bigots. Will he give us Round 2 of his obscene portrayal of Christianity, or will the guy who grew up playing with dolls tap the brakes and be a good boy? If he does, it will show that our protest was not in vain.\nOur protest was aimed at many parties to the Olympics. We contacted Thomas Bach, President of the International Olympic Committee; the fifteen major sponsors of the Olympics; leading Republicans and Democrats; and the U.S. Olympic Committee. We not only protested what happened in the opening ceremony, we asked that they make sure that the closing ceremony is not a repeat.\nThe Catholic League was the only Catholic organization to register a formal protest. Moreover, by supplying contact information, we were the only one to give Catholics a voice in registering their objections. And unlike others, who did next to nothing, we didn’t try to hustle our supporters by asking for a donation.\nWe are happy that so many contacted Bach in July about what Jolly did. You can contact him again about the closing ceremony.\n Contact: media@paris2024.org",

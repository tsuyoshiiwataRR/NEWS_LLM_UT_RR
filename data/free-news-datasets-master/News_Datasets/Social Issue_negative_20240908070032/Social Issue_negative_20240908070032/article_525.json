    "text": "MAGA influencers call for boycott of Dunkin' Donuts Published in [Political News](/politics/politicalnews/) Dunkin’ Donuts is facing a boycott from prominent MAGA figures after Rumble’s CEO claimed the chain won’t advertise on his video sharing platform due to divisive right-wing content. The grumbling began Wednesday when Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski posted what appeared to be a snippet of an email from Dunkin’s parent company, Inspire Brands. “I would be opposed to showing up on the current version of the platform,” the email read. “The right wing culture of the site is too polarizing from a brand sustainability standpoint today.” The sender added that Inspire Brands would be open to revisiting the matter as “the site evolves.” Rumble hosts programming from controversial right-wing fabulists including Alex Jones, Nick Fuentes and Tucker Carlson. Social media MAGA influencer Catturd expressed outrage over Dunkin’s choice on X — another online platform struggling to attract advertisers because of its far right-wing content. “So, companies like POS @dunkindonuts are boycotting Rumble, and X, unless they drop all the truth tellers,” the online personality wrote Wednesday night to his 2.7 million followers. “I’m calling on everyone to BudLight @dunkindonuts.” Bud Light took a financial blow in 2023 after it launched a promotion featuring transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The campaign offended MAGA loyalists including musician Kid Rock, who filmed himself shooting at several cases of beer. Right-wing pundit Steven Crowder, who has 2.2 million followers on X, praised Pavlovski’s decision to target potential advertisers that choose to avoid content they find objectionable. He also encouraged his supporters to exercise their freedom to boycott such companies. “This is the power that YOU have,” he wrote on the platform Thursday. “When you don’t Kowtow to the woke mob, you win.” Crowder was one of several activists who celebrated Wednesday’s New York Times report that the Global Alliance for Responsible Media — an organization being sued by Rumble and X — was suspending operations amid antitrust allegations. The nonprofit group said it can’t afford to fight back. Inspire Brands, which also operates Arby’s, Baskin Robbins and Buffalo Wild Wings, hasn’t responded to a request for comment. ©2024 New York Daily News. Visit nydailynews.com.

    "text": "NEW HAVEN, Conn. — A kidnapping suspect attacked officers in Hamden while being taken into custody Wednesday, according to New Haven police . Derrick Gilliam, 29, is facing charges in multiple towns, including New Haven, in connection to a kidnapping, and East Haven, related to a domestic violence incident. Hamden police said they have an arrest warrant for Gilliam on a protective order violation and will be applying for an additional arrest warrant after he fought with officers while being taken into custody. Gilliam has 11 outstanding arrest warrants, according to New Haven police. At 11:27 a.m. Wednesday, New Haven officers went to the emergency department of St. Raphael's hospital after receiving a report about a person who was assaulted. The victim told officers that she was kidnapped by Gilliam, who she knew. New Haven police said they were told that she left her house and was getting into her friend's car to go to work when Gilliam suddenly ran up to her and punched her. Gilliam then allegedly picked the victim up and threw her in his car, police said. The victim told officers that he continued assaulting her while \"driving recklessly through the city\" and threatened to throw her out of the vehicle. The victim said she was able to escape the car in East Haven after Gilliam pulled into a parking lot and that she spotted an officer who called for medical attention. Gilliam had taken off from the scene before police could respond, according to New Haven police. East Haven police told Hamden officers that they were trying to find and arrest Gilliam on domestic violence charges for an incident that took place in their town. They also noted that he was threatening to take his own life and wanted to be killed by police. After East Haven police learned Gilliam was in the area of Hamden Plaza, Hamden police said they found his car parked in the plaza. Officers approached the car to take Gilliam into custody when he got out and began fighting with them, Hamden police said. He allegedly yelled at the officers to \"kill him\" and \"bit, scratched and attempted to punch\" the officers before being arrested. Multiple officers were injured during the struggle, according to Hamden police. Gilliam was turned over to New Haven police to face charges from the city's police department. New Haven police said he is being guarded at the hospital on a $500,000 bond for kidnapping and other charges and was expected to appear at New Haven Superior Court Friday.

    "text": "Democratic delegates might have tough time finding Chicago’s migrant crisis Kurtis Karg Dylan Sharkey Assistant Editor\nUncategorized by Kurtis Karg , Dylan Sharkey August 8, 2024 twitter facebook Democratic delegates might have tough time finding Chicago’s migrant crisis Chicago’s migrant crisis has been national news and a $430-million headache. But those in the city for the Democratic National Convention will have a hard time seeing the problem because the city has moved shelters out of downtown and to the South Side.\nThe Democratic National Convention is coming to Chicago Aug. 19-22, and city leaders are moving migrants out of the downtown area while delegates from across the nation visit.\nMayor Brandon Johnson formed plans to move new migrants to Chicago’s South Side, replacing a shelter downtown ahead of the heavily publicized convention. The city claims moving the migrants has nothing to do with the Democratic National Convention coming to town.\nChicago has spent more than $430 million since 2022 to house, feed and care for over 46,000 migrants bused or flown to the “sanctuary city” by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott after they crossed the border. Data from the New Arrivals Mission shows nearly 90% of funding has gone to three private vendors:\nFavorite Healthcare Staffing: $277 million Equitable Social Solutions: $81.5 million Open Kitchens: $25 million Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s $53 billion budget also includes $182 million to help Chicago cover the costs of caring for migrants.\nData from the Illinois Comptroller shows the state spent over $126 million on asylum seekers since November 2023. This doesn’t include other funding sources such as medical assistance, rental assistance or other benefits from local governments.\nIf a lawsuit had not been filed in Cook County Circuit Court, there would be little disclosure of where these public dollars were being spent. Many of the lease agreements related to migrant shelters have yet to be released by the Chicago Department of Family and Support Services.\nMembers of the Chicago City Council criticized Mayor Brandon Johnson for dipping into federal COVID-19 funding, spending $95 million in federal funds to help cover staffing at migrant shelters. Johnson said his decision was possible thanks to higher than expected city revenues allowing the federal funds to be shifted from city operations. Aldermen slammed the plan, saying there was a lack of transparency and it was a misuse of funds intended to help the city recover from the pandemic.\nAld. Scott Waguespack, 32nd Ward, told NBC 5 , “My problem here is that we don’t know exactly how they’re going to spend that money.”\nJohnson and the city sweeping issues under a rug may reduce visibility from national leaders, but it doesn’t fool Chicagoans who feel the consequences of his actions every day. South Side residents are now living with migrants they see receiving city services they have long been denied.\nWant more? Get stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.

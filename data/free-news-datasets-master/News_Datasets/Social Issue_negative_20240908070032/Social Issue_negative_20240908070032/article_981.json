Here's the latest from the Storm Team.\nShare Copy Link Copy {copyShortcut} to copy Link copied! Updated: 5:02 PM EDT Aug 8, 2024 EIGHT. NOW THE WGAL NEWS EIGHT STORM TEAM FORECAST WITH METEOROLOGIST TJ SPRINGER. IT HAS BEEN SUCH A GLOOMY DAY ACROSS THE VALLEY, AND WE’RE CONTINUING TO SEE THESE SHOWERS WORK THROUGH. IT’S ALL THANKS TO A STALLED FRONT THAT’S BEEN WITH US HERE. IT’S WHY IT’S BEEN A NASTIER DAY. WHY WE CONTINUE TO SEE THESE LITTLE BURSTS OF SHOWERS MOVE ON THROUGH. REALLY, OUR BIG CONCERN, THOUGH, IS DEBBIE, AND THAT’S WHAT WE’RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WATCH CLOSELY OVER THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS. WE CAN SEE IT CIRCULATING STILL A TROPICAL STORM AT THIS HOUR ACROSS THE CAROLINAS. SOME TORNADO WARNINGS HAVE BEEN ONGOING HERE THROUGHOUT SOME OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS. AND WE’RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WATCH DEBBIE TREK NORTHBOUND THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF OUR THURSDAY INTO OUR FRIDAY. HERE’S THAT GREAT VIEW IN THE RED ROSE CITY. WE’RE PEEKING OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. WE’VE HAD SOME SPRINKLES AT TIMES HERE IN LANCASTER THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. HASN’T BEEN SUPER WET, BUT WE NEED THE RAIN, JUST THE FLOODING. WE COULD LEAVE THAT, BUT WE ARE GOING TO GET SOME MUCH NEEDED RAINFALL NONETHELESS. AS DEBBIE MOVES IN. WE’RE STILL IN A DROUGHT ACROSS THE ENTIRETY OF THE AREA WITH THIS STORM FRONT ON TOP OF US, IT FEELS A BIT BETTER OFF TO OUR NORTH AND EAST, BUT THE WIND COMING TOGETHER PRETTY MUCH ON TOP OF THE VALLEY HAS LED TO THE SHOWERS, BUT IT’S ALSO KEPT THINGS ON THE HUMID SIDE IN THE MID 70S. IN GETTYSBURG FEELS PRETTY NASTY OUT THAT WAY. IT’S SOUPY, IT’S THICK OUT THERE IN THE 70S AS WELL FOR LANCASTER AND HARRISBURG IN THE UPPER 60S, IN LEBANON WITH TEMPERATURES NOT ALL THAT MUCH HIGHER THAN THE DEW POINTS FOR THAT MATTER. WE’RE GOING TO HANG PRETTY STEADY TOO. WE’RE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE 70S FOR THE MOST PART, BUT WE DO HAVE 72 IN LEBANON, 79 IN GETTYSBURG AND 78 FOR THOSE OF YOU IN CHAMBERSBURG THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING, WE ARE GOING TO WATCH OUT FOR SOME HIT OR MISS SHOWERS, MAYBE A CLAP OF THUNDER OR TWO POSSIBLE. WE’LL HAVE TEMPERATURES IN THE 70S. WE’RE BACK INTO THE LOW TO MID 70S OVERNIGHT. THE RAIN IS GOING TO BE BECOMING HEAVIER AND EVENTUALLY IT’S GOING TO BECOME HEAVIEST INTO OUR EARLY FRIDAY. THAT’S WHY IT’S AN IMPACT NIGHT AND AN ALERT DAY TOMORROW, BECAUSE FLOODING IS A POSSIBILITY. WE ARE EXPECTING 2 TO 4IN OF RAIN. COULD HAVE SOME ISOLATED AMOUNTS HIGHER THAN THAT, AND WE ALSO ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR A TORNADO THREAT A FEW TORNADOES ARE POSSIBLE WITH TEMPERATURES RIGHT AROUND 80. IT’S BECAUSE OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL WIND IN THE ATMOSPHERE. THANKS TO THE TROPICAL NATURE OF WHAT WILL BE THE REMNANTS OF DEBBIE AS IT CONTINUES TO WEAKEN FROM A TROPICAL STORM INTO A DEPRESSION AND EVENTUALLY LOSING ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS. RIGHT NOW, THE WINDS SUSTAINED AT 40MPH, 55 MILES EAST SOUTHEAST OF CHARLOTTE. MOVING, MOVING NORTH NORTHWESTWARD AT TEN MILES PER HOUR. AND YOU CAN SEE IT CONTINUES TO MOVE UP TO THE NORTH. EVENTUALLY BECOMING MORE NORTHEASTERLY IN ITS TRAJECTORY. AS SOME UPPER LEVEL WINDS STARTS TO HELP KICK DEBBIE OFF TO THE EAST NORTHEAST, EVENTUALLY HEADING UP TOWARD THE CANADIAN MARITIMES. LATER IN THE WEEKEND. SO WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING? WELL, THE BIGGER CONCERNS, AS I MENTIONED, THE HEAVY RAIN AND THE SEVERE STORM POTENTIAL. 5 A.M. TOMORROW THROUGH 5 P.M. IN THE EVENING. THEN ENDING LATER IN THE EVENING. FLOODING IS A HUGE THREAT. I WOULD SAY THE BIGGEST THREAT, BUT BRIEF SPIN UP TORNADOES ARE NOT OFF THE TABLE. THEN WE’RE EXPECTING THAT POTENTIAL FOR RAIN IN THAT 2 TO 4 INCH REALM, WHICH IS GOING TO LEAD TO THAT FLOODING THAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT IMPACTS AT LEAST GUSTS WISE, COULD GET UP AROUND 35MPH WITH THAT. AND THAT TORNADIC THREAT, IF ONE WERE TO SPIN UP. POWER OUTAGES ARE POSSIBLE. PONDING ON ROADWAYS IS ALSO EXPECTED AND THEN WITH THE HEAVY RAIN, OUR RIVERS, CREEKS, STREAMS GOING TO BECOME SWOLLEN WITH THE NATURE OF THE RAIN. HERE’S PREDICTOR. LET’S TIME IT OUT THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF OUR DAY. YOU CAN SEE IT’S NOT ALL THAT NICE, BUT IT’S OVERALL FAIRLY DRY. ASIDE FROM SOME HIT OR MISS SHOWERS. BUT THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT WE START TO SEE DEBBIE’S BANDS LIFTING IN. YOU CAN SEE SOME BURSTS OF HEAVIER RAINFALL. THOSE REDS AND YELLOWS ORANGES INDICATING THE HEAVIER RAIN POTENTIAL FOR ROTATING THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE MORNING TOMORROW. THEN IT ALL STARTS TO TAPER OFF FROM WEST TO EAST AS DEBBIE’S CIRCULATION LIFTS OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. AND WE GET INTO THAT DRIER AIR CLOSER TO DINNERTIME TOMORROW. SO OVERALL, IT’S A MORE MORNING TO EARLY AFTERNOON EVENT THAN LATER IN THE EVENING EVENT. IN TERMS OF THE FLOODING CONCERNS, WE DO HAVE FLOOD WATCHES THAT HAVE BEEN EXPANDED A BIT NOW INCLUDES ADAMS AND DAUPHIN COUNTY TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. WOULDN’T BE SHOCKED IF WE SEE THESE GET EXTENDED AND EXPANDED JUST A BIT MORE IN TERMS OF RAINFALL. AGAIN, I’VE BEEN HITTING ON THIS ALL DAY LONG. THIS ENTIRE STORM TEAM HAS 2 TO 4IN, BUT THERE COULD BE SOME ISOLATED AMOUNTS POTENTIALLY HIGHER THAN THAT, ESPECIALLY OUT TO THE WEST. NOW OUR NEWS EIGHT STORM TEAM TEN DAY FORECAST DOES SHOW TEMPERATURES BACK INTO THE LOWER 80S. REALLY A NICE WEEKEND, PLEASANT, REFRESHING. BACK INTO THE MIDDLE 80S. MONDAY. HIGH PRESSURE. GOING TO BE HOLDING STRONG.

Springer Meteorologist Ethan Huston Meteorologist More rain is on the way as Debby continues to move northward. The clouds today along with showers and a few rumbles will aid in keeping our temps cooler than average. Highs look to rise only into the upper 70s. As we head into tonight, more widespread rain is on the docket as Flood Watches go into effect. Rain looks to fall heavily at times tonight into Friday with 2-4\" likely throughout the region. Some of our western neighborhoods could pick up more than that. This makes for swollen waterways across the Valley and the potential for some flooding in lower-lying areas. Be sure to stay weather aware. Another aspect of Debby will be the severe threat. We'll good deal of organizational wind on this side of the storm which makes for some rotating storm potential. The tornado threat is certainly not 0! We'll be watching closely over the next 24 to 36 hours. High pressure builds in behind the remnants of Debby by Saturday and it'll be much quieter. We'll see plenty of sunshine with temps stay below average. It'll be comfier too with highs holding in the lower 80s. That'll combine with dew points in the 50s, making it feel wonderful outdoors. Overall, a stretch of pleasant conditions dominate our weather pattern through the latter half of the 10-Day. We'll see a mix of clouds and sun with highs stay seasonable for this time of year.

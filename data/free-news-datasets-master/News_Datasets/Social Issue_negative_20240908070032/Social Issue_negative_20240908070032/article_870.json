    "text": "Winter fuel payments - Neil Bussey/iStockphoto Scrapping winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners could save a third less than the Chancellor has claimed, a former pensions minister has warned. The Government has said restricting the extra support to those on means-tested benefits – leaving almost 10 million pensioners worse off – will retain £1.4 billion for Treasury coffers in the first year. But Sir Steve Webb, a Liberal Democrat pensions minister in the coalition government, estimated that those savings could be cut by £490 million as retirees hit by the change seek extra support from the state. Currently, all 11.4 million pensioners receive an extra £200 to help heat their homes every winter, with those over 80 receiving a blanket £300 payment. Under Rachel Reeves’ plans, announced last week, only those receiving pension credit or other means-tested benefits will be eligible for the additional support. However many retirees do not claim pension credit despite being eligible, with the latest statistics suggesting that between 720,000 and 880,000 people are missing out. If one in four of these pensioners were to put in a claim, Sir Steve estimates that a third of the Treasury’s expected savings could be wiped out, with the Government forking out an extra £440 million in benefits and no longer able to bank £50 million in axed winter fuel payments. The former minister cited the 2019 decision to restrict free TV licences for the over-75s to those who qualify for pension credit – which was followed by a surge in people claiming the benefit – as a possible precedent. He said the impact of the winter fuel change could be even bigger because it affects all pensioners, not just those over 75, and the amount potentially lost – between £200 and £300 – is more than the cost of a TV licence five years ago. Sir Steve said it was “highly likely” that the winter fuel announcement would lead to “a flurry of new claims for pension credit”, adding: “This is exactly what happened when entitlement to a free TV licence for the over-75s was restricted to those on benefit. “But a big surge in take-up could slash the savings from this measure. If just one in four of those currently missing out on their entitlement to pension credit now makes a claim, this could cut the Chancellor’s savings by around one third. One consequence of this is that additional cuts might be required to make up for the shortfall.” Ms Reeves’ plan is part of a wider drive to fill a “black hole” in the nation’s finances, with Labour aiming to save £5.5 billion this year alone. Pollsters have reported a “real depth of anger” from pensioners over the spending cut. Luke Tryl, the UK director of More in Common, said feedback from retirees in Leigh, Greater Manchester, had been even more negative than expected. Some called the change “disgusting”, claimed to feel like “second-class citizens” and accused Labour of betraying its principles. Pension credit is sometimes referred to as a “gateway benefit”, with claimants also gaining access to council tax reduction, housing benefit and support for mortgage interest, along with free eye tests. Separately to Sir Steve’s calculations, Baroness Ros Altmann, a Tory peer and leading pensions expert, warned that this would amount to an extra cost of “thousands of pounds per person”. She argued that “trying to balance the books off the back of pensioners is flawed”, and that retirees could end up “seriously ill” if they assume, like the Government, that “if we can’t afford it, we can’t pay it”. She said: “That will mean more cost to NHS, more people in hospital and more calls on GPs. That element of the extra costs also needs to be factored into any potential saving.” Simon Francis, of the End Fuel Poverty charity collective, also argued that the savings made by scrapping the universal winter fuel benefit would be eclipsed by added costs for the NHS. He said: “It’s a false economy because they are cutting back on winter fuel payments but will push elderly people living in cold, damp homes into the arms of the NHS. “Illnesses linked to cold, damp and dangerous homes already cost the NHS more than £2.5 billion a year, according to UCL’s Institute of Health Equity. “If you add another two million pensioners into fuel poverty, and millions more struggling with their bills, then this cost could soar. So the minister may save on the winter fuel payments only to see the cost of treating the ill-health caused by the move increase.” A Government spokesman said: “This Government is committed to pensioners – protecting the triple lock, keeping energy bills low through our Warm Homes Plan, and cutting NHS waiting lists, bringing real stability to people’s lives. “We said we would be honest with the public and, given the dire state of the public finances we have inherited, this Government must take difficult decisions to fix the foundations of the economy. “In these circumstances, it is right that winter fuel payments are targeted at those in most need, and we will work with local authorities to boost the uptake of pension credit, reaching the many pensioners who could still benefit from this year’s winter fuel payments.” Play The Telegraph’s brilliant range of Puzzles - and feel brighter every day.

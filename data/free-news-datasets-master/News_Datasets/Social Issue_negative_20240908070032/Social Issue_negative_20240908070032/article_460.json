    "text": "Aurora Iturri passed away peacefully on August 6th in Scottsdale, Arizona. Born in Linzoain, Navarra, Spain to Antonio and Margarita Urrutia, Aurora was the sixth of twelve children, a beloved part of a large and close-knit family. She left her homeland after marrying the love of her life, Esteban Iturri, and together they began a new chapter in Genoa, raising their family at Harvey's James Canyon Ranch. Later, Aurora and her family moved to Minden, where she spent over 35 years building a life filled with love, warmth, and treasured memories. Aurora was known for her incredible culinary talents, particularly her Basque cooking, which brought joy to family and friends alike. Her kitchen was a place of comfort, where meals were prepared with love and served with a generosity of spirit that defined her character. She cherished the simple pleasures of lifeâ€”sharing meals with loved ones, dancing at Basque picnics, and enjoying the vibrant culture she held so dear. Aurora's legacy lives on in her devoted daughter, Aurora Iturri, her son and daughter-in-law, Jose and Gabriela Iturri, and her two precious granddaughters, Natalia and Sofia, who were the light of her life. She is also survived by many who knew and loved her deeply. Aurora was preceded in death by her husband, Esteban, her parents, and five of her siblings, with whom she now rests in eternal peace. Aurora was a person of love and strength, admired by all who had the privilege of knowing her. Her memory will forever remain in our hearts. As she joins Esteban and those who passed before her, we find comfort in knowing she is surrounded by the love of family and friends, both here and in heaven. May she rest in peace. Funeral Mass service will be held at St. Gall Community, August 23rd, at 11:00am",

    "text": "Illegal immigration is one of the leading issues in the upcoming presidential election. Many look at these migrants as murderers, rapists, gang members and common criminals. In reality, the vast majority of immigrants are good people who are fleeing a series of complex crises including gang violence, poverty, political repression and natural disasters. Maybe if we looked at them as desperate people looking for a better life and put ourselves in their place and ask what would we do. You know, a little empathy that can foster greater acceptance of immigrants. For these migrants there are few legal paths into our country. Why is that? If we put politics aside and cooperatively looked for answers there would be no immigration problem. When a bi-partisan solution was put on the table, the person responsible for it not happening was Donald Trump. The irony is that people will still support a man who is at least partially responsible for the continuing crisis at our southern border. Another important issue involves inflation. Inflation is influenced by a wide range of complex factors most outside the power of the president. However, it’s said a president’s spending can contribute to inflation. Joe Biden’s executive actions and his infrastructure bill may have contributed to higher inflation. Also, Trump’s spending of trillions at the time of the pandemic was also a factor that did not surface until the pandemic subsided and demand increased. Another irony is that while Democrats are willing to admit Biden’s weaknesses and is why he is not running, Trump supporters ignore the many many reasons he should be nowhere near the White House ever again.

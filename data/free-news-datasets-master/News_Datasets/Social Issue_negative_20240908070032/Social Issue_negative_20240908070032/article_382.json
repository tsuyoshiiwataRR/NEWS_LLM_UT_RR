    "text": "HOUSTON, Texas – When CenterPoint announced it was withdrawing its rate case last week , most customers assumed it was a good thing that the utility company wasn’t asking to raise rates again. But several cities, including Houston, say Centerpoint should be lowering rates.\nIn a filing to the Public Utility Commission on August 8, The Gulf Coast Coalition of Cities, the Texas Coast Utilities Coalition , the Houston Coalition of Cities, and the Texas Consumer Association asked the PUC not to allow CenterPoint to drop the case.\nRecommended Videos\nThey say doing so deprives them of the chance to explain why they say CenterPoint is overcharging ratepayers by as much as $100 million every year.\nIn a rate case, the PUC can raise rates, lower rates, or not change them at all.\nPart of the filing reads:\n“In this case, dismissal would prevent ratepayers from receiving the benefit of a significant rate decrease and would enable CenterPoint to avoid a required filing only to impose substantial costs on ratepayers in a future proceeding.”\nFiling to the PUC says dismissal would deprive ratepayers of the benefit of a rate decrease. (Copyright 2024 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.) A judge has given CenterPoint until August 14, 2024 to respond.\nIn a statement released by the company last week, CenterPoint said the decision to withdraw a previous rate increase request was centered around rebuilding trust with the community and wanting to focus on improving resiliency around Houston as the hurricane season continues.\nThursday evening, CenterPoint sent the following statement to KPRC 2:\nOur collective focus is taking action to be better prepared this hurricane season. That is our singular focus and why we launched the Greater Houston Resilience Initiative this week. Withdrawing our base rate case with the PUCT will support our commitments to strengthen our resiliency, improve our communications and enhance our emergency coordination. We look forward to providing more information on August 14th as part of our overall commitment to become the most resilient coastal utility in the country.\nCopyright 2024 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.",

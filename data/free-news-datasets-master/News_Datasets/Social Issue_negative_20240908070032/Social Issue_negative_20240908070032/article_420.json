    "text": "The visit of Hena Shahab, the widow of late gangster-turned-politician and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Shahabuddin, to Lalu Prasad Yadav has stirred a political debate in Bihar.Hena called on Lalu Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav on Wednesday evening at the residence of an MLC in Patna.While the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan sources predicted a political rendezvous between the Lalu and Shahabuddin families, the BJP accused the RJD supremo of trying to bolster the “nexus of villains” responsible for the perils faced by people of Bihar during the 15 years of 'jungle raj'.Shahabuddin, who was known as a bahubali (strongman) and considered close to party chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, died of Covid-19 in May 2021 while serving a life sentence for murder in Delhi’s Tihar Jail.However, the relationship between Shahabuddin’s family and the RJD has recently soured. Earlier, attempts by the Lalu family to persuade Hena had failed. The Wednesday meetings assume significance, as they hint at mending these relations.The BJP has criticised the RJD, citing the ‘criminal background’ of the late MP. BJP spokesperson Kuntal Krishna claimed that Lalu Yadav was busy assembling the \"villains of jungle raj\", adding said the veteran RJD leader was attempting to reunite all such “evildoers” after losing prominence in Bihar politics.The JD(U), also noting that Hena had no cases registered against her, accused the RJD of trying to bring together the components of the fifteen years of Lalu-Rabri Raj in Bihar.JD(U) national secretary Rajiv Ranjan said, “This is something not unforeseen in RJD’s politics so far. No one can deny the fact that Hena Shahab has no cases filed against her, but people know who is around her.”“The decision to mend fences with Shahabuddin’s family will bring no political gain for the Mahagathbandhan, and the RJD in particular,” Ranjan added.He also stated that voters in Siwan elected a JD(U) candidate to the Lok Sabha during the last general elections, and no one would settle for a Bihar that existed prior to 2005.However, RJD spokespersons remained tight-lipped about the meeting. Hena Shahab contested the recent Lok Sabha elections as an independent candidate after the RJD chose to field Awadh Bihari Chaudhary from Siwan.Prior to the Lok Sabha polls, Tejashwi Yadav was anticipated to meet Hena during his Jan Viswas Yatra. However, the meeting could not be convened as Hena had left Siwan for her village for \"personal reasons\" when the Yatra arrived at the constituency.Published By: Ajmal Published On: Aug 9, 2024Trending Reel",

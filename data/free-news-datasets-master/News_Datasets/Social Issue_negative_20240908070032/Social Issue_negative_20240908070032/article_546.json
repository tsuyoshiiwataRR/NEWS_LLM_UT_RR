    "text": "Umer Jamshaid Published August 09, 2024 | 01:50 AM\nQUETTA, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 9th Aug, 2024) Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti expressed his anger over the illegal trawling in the province and directed to take strict action against those involved mafias.\nThe CM said that our national resources and coasts were being destroyed by illegal trawling, what happened in the past and what the previous governments was done, we have to stop this disaster today, our own people were involved in illegal trawling.\nHe said that the future of generations could not be put at stake for temporary financial gains, action would now take place without discrimination.\nHe expressed these views while presiding over a high-level meeting on preparations for the national meeting of the Inter-Provincial Coordination Committee here.\nProvincial Adviser for Labour and Manpower, Sardar Ghulam Rasool Umrani, Parliamentary Secretary Fisheries Mir Barkat Rind, Parliamentary Secretary IPC Meena Baloch, Chief Secretary Balochistan Shakeel Qadir Khan, Principal Secretary Imran Zarkoon Additional Secretary Chief Minister Secretariat Muhammad Faridoon, Secretary Fisheries Javed Anwar Shahwani and concerned authorities attended the meeting.\nIn the meeting, the proposed issues and position related to Balochistan were discussed in the Inter-Provincial Coordination Committee meeting.\nAddressing the meeting, Chief Minister Balochistan said that the coastal natural resources of the province were a national trust in which betrayal was not tolerable, it was a pity that these resources were brutally looted.\nNo one else is involved in this looting but our own people, various institutions are in place to prevent illegal trawling but the performance is unsatisfactory, he said.\nHe said that during the last eight to ten years, fisheries emerged as a major sector but no concrete mechanism was introduced to prevent illegal trawling.\nBy which the mafia got stronger and the coastal resources were looted, nothing like that will work now, action will be taken against those elements involved in the looting of resources and they will be held accountable, I will personally supervise all the proceedings, he underlined.\nThe Chief Minister directed that a modern monitoring system should be introduced to prevent illegal trawling and no exception should be made to those involved in illegal trawling.",

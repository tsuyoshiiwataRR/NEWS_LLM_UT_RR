Please do your own research before making any online purchase.\nAre there toxic people in your life?\nPerhaps you’ve experienced having\nthat one fake friend who, when things are going well with your life, makes you feel like you’re still not good enough by pointing out your flaws instead of affirming your success (for instance, someone who has a perpetual “ crabs in a bucket mentality”).\nOr you might have a partner or family member who makes you feel guilty about how great your life is while they struggle with their own because they claim to be “\nvictims” of a world that doesn’t give them any breaks.\nToxic people are harmful to your health.\nJust how harmful are they?\nWell, the results of a\nstudy published in the Journal of the American Medical Association revealed that being in a relationship with a negative person increases your risk of having heart disease, diabetes, and metabolism issues.\nSome people probably become toxic as a result of their own experiences in life. For example, they may have been raised in a dysfunctional household where they were not taught to handle their emotions healthily. But regardless of the source of their\nnegative behavior, its effects are felt in the present, and you’re most likely a target.\nAlthough completely cutting off all communication with them is the simplest solution to avoid the adverse effects of toxic people’s behavior, it is not always the most practical.\nIn this article, we will show you practical ways to deal with a toxic person in a relationship, in your family, and in the workplace.\nFirst, let’s check out the signs of a toxic person.\n(Side note: Another positive way to improve your life is to read and learn something new every day.\nA great tool to do this is to join over 1 million others and start your day with the latest FREE, informative news from this website.)\n15 Signs a Person is Toxic to Your Life\n1. You or others are blamed for their negative feelings and circumstances.\nToxic people tend to\nproject their feelings of inadequacy or insecurity toward the people closest to them rather than be accountable for these emotions. For example, someone in a bad mood but won’t own their feelings or take responsibility for them may turn to you and say, “You’re sure in a bad mood today,” which will probably leave you confused.\nYou’ll often find yourself on the defense without really understanding why. You will get accusations or questions that don’t make sense to you or seemingly come out of nowhere.\n2. You are wrong and they are right all the time.\nWhen someone in your life does not admit mistakes and insists that you are wrong all the time, you’re likely dealing with a toxic person.\nThey will go to great extremes to be correct, including changing facts or challenging your memories. Toxic people do not readily admit when they have made a mistake, miscalculated something, or misspoken.\n(\nLearn more about how toxic people poison the well when they want to discredit others.)\n3. They disregard your boundaries.\nIt does not matter if you’ve requested that they stop behaving a certain way—a toxic person will continue to act in a way that violates your wishes. Toxic people will also expect you to come through for them regardless of the time of day and your circumstance. Building a positive, supportive relationship with people who disregard your boundaries and don’t even recognize when they’re walking all over you is almost impossible.\nYour personal boundaries are the barriers that you set to separate yourself from the world around you. Your boundaries help define you and ensure that you are protected from people who are hurtful, disrespectful, and invasive. People with healthy boundaries know their limits and can express themselves. However, people with unhealthy boundaries pull on you in aggressive ways and don’t know when to stop.\n4. They are habitually dishonest.\nToxic people are known for their constant lies, even about the smallest things. They could exaggerate the facts of a story or truly make something up, a\ncommon manipulative tactic used by gaslighters.\nThey might do it because they have very low self-esteem, and they are trying to give it a boost, or perhaps it’s their way of getting what they want. If a toxic person is telling you an elaborate story, you can typically assume that it is only a half-truth.\n5. They don’t apologize.\nEven if they are wrong, toxic people will usually not apologize. In instances when toxic people do apologize, it’s usually a calculated move to manipulate you to give them what they want. They always feel like they have to be correct, no matter what, and will change the information to be right or blame other people.\nFor more tips on dealing with a specific type of toxic person, check out this post on handling\n ungrateful people.\n6. They revel in being victims.\nTheir victim status is a manipulative strategy to gain sympathy and attention. Toxic people can always find someone else to blame for their problems. Maybe they missed a deadline because no one reminded them about it, or they are late for work because their spouse didn't set an alarm.\nBad things happen to everyone at some point. However, toxic people are happy to blame everyone else for their problems, including the issues they should take ownership of. But chances are, whatever happens to a toxic person will be someone else’s fault.\n7. They are habitually sarcastic.\nA little bit of sarcasm here and there can be funny. However, too much sarcasm can hurt people’s feelings and belittle them. Hence, it’s a\nfavorite weapon of toxic people. Sarcasm is rooted in anger, distrust, and weakness.\nToxic people are so used to communicating with sarcasm that they can't see how much damage they're doing. When called out on it, toxic people often respond to the accusation of being hurtful with even more anger. Excessive sarcasm is never a healthy way to communicate with people.\n8. They refuse to listen to you.\nToxic people act bored or change the conversation topic when you are talking. However, they expect you to listen to them when they talk. Your talking takes away from any attention that could be on them and puts the focus on you.\nRather than listening to what you have to say to understand you, a toxic person will only think of what they want to say next. They will seem uninterested in what you say and turn the conversation back to themselves instead of trying to understand where you are coming from.\n9. They feign concern for your welfare.\nPretending they are concerned about you is a ploy that toxic individuals often use to make you feel like they care about you, especially when you are beginning to sense that something is off.\nThis false sense of concern can be mistaken for genuine remorse. Still, it is just a calculated attempt to catch you at a weak moment or appeal to your sentimentality. Toxic people will suck you back into the relationship by showing you desirable behaviors as soon as they think you are about to wiggle your way free from their grip.\nRemember,\nyou deserve better.\n10. They are critical of others.\nYou will notice that toxic people habitually put others down. If you are with someone constantly speaking poorly about others when those people are not around, chances are that they are doing the same to you.\nToxic people like to harp on the weaknesses that they see in others to boost their own self-esteem. They verbally judge people for superficial things or harp on someone's honest mistake and rarely point out the good in people.\n11. They make you feel defensive about your decisions.\nEverything you say or do is met with argument, and you wonder if this person is questioning your intelligence. The criticisms and sarcasm directed at you can eventually take their toll and keep you on guard.\nYou stop feeling like you can be yourself around this person in anticipation of their criticism, and eventually, you find yourself filtering what you say when conversing with a negative person.\n12. They are inconsistent in their behavior.\nNothing is stable when you’re with a toxic person. Opinions, preferences, and plans could go one way today and another tomorrow. Often, there isn’t an obvious explanation for the change in attitude—you can tell something isn’t right.\nThey might be cold or cranky, and when asked if something's wrong, they say “nothing,”—but they’ll add in a sigh or a facial expression to let you know that something is going on. You then probably look for ways to make them happy, which is why toxic people do this.\nToxic people know that decent people will go out of their way to keep the people around them happy. They realize that you are uncomfortable wondering what they're thinking. However, it would be best if you didn't have to constantly guess which version of the person you will be interacting with each day.\nFor further reading,\ncheck out our article about spotting signs people don't like you.\n13. They have no interest in what’s important to you.\nInstead, they will find out why your good news isn't so great. For example, if you are about to go on a trip to the beach, they might say, “The heat is going to be miserable.” Or, if you just got a promotion at work, they might say, “That's a huge amount of work for such little compensation.”\nTalking about the good things happening in your life takes away the spotlight from them, so toxic friends or family members often use fault-finding to make you feel inferior. If you are excited that something unique just happened to you, you are usually better off keeping it to yourself around toxic people.\n14. They boast about their achievements.\nThe need to brag has its roots in deep-seated insecurity. People who feel inferior spend their time overcompensating to make themselves appear superior to others. These uncertain people can only be happy by making others noticeably unhappy. Toxic people often brag to compensate for the shortcomings they desperately hope you will never discover.\nThey will even take credit for someone else's accomplishments because they need validation to feel like they are better than others. These people who have no sense of self-worth still have an intrinsic need to feel like valuable members of society, and this need can only be met if they project their perceived greatness.\n15. They take, take, and take.\nAs long as you’re able or willing, toxic people will take from you—your time, possessions, attention—without consideration or any thought of returning or giving back what they’ve taken. This is a form of manipulation. When you are with this person, you likely feel like the only one contributing to the relationship. Toxic people send a message that you owe something to them—and chances are, you believe it.\nThey are even able to take from you or hurt you in some way and then insist they did it all for you. This is especially common in relationships with some differentiation in power, such as in a working relationship.\nFor example, a supervisor may say, “I’ve left this three months’ worth of filing for you. I figured that you would appreciate the experience of learning how to use the filing cabinets,” or, “I’m hosting a dinner party—why don’t you bring the food? It’ll give you the opportunity to show off your cooking skills.”\nBelow is an infographic depicting some types of toxic or negative people and quick tips on how to free yourself from their influence.\nWays to Deal with Toxic Family Members\nYou probably know several\nnegative people. However, unlike with friends or coworkers, you cannot altogether avoid contact with toxic members of your family. Fortunately, the following suggestions can help you deal with these people.\nEstablish boundaries.\nA healthy boundary system in a family incorporates a healthy mix of interaction and autonomy for each family member. For example, parents shouldn't talk to their children about conflict with each other, but they should speak to the children about how much they love them. And children should have age-appropriate autonomy, but not so much so that they feel neglected.\nEnsure family members know what you can or cannot do for them. For example, communicate to your sister that you are uncomfortable picking her up every time she’s drunk over the limit and can’t drive herself.\nAlso, let them know what things you can and cannot accept from them, whether it’s your mother’s spicy beef casserole or unsolicited advice on how to raise your children. Determining where a boundary line should be can be challenging, especially if it hasn't been clearly and mutually drawn. By openly communicating about boundaries with your family, you can build healthier relationships that are safe, and respectful relationships.\nAssert, but don’t condescend.\nToxic people will often test your boundaries, and the same goes for family members. Speak up if a family member is going over the limits that you’ve set. Be firm with your boundaries without making anyone feel bad. Tell them what you can do for them, but remind them that you must also care for your needs.\nFor example, if your sister continues to disregard your request not to call her during all night hours to give her a ride, find a time to assert your wishes without hurting her feelings. Say something like, “I need to sleep—can we find you a different way to get you home safely?” rather than “Why are you so needy?” They will attack back if you condescend to a negative person or make them feel attacked.\nAvoid discussing private matters with them.\nAlthough they are family, these negative individuals can use the private information you tell them as ammunition for an attack in the future.\nNegative people are known for being dishonest, and while they can make up an entire story that could hurt you, they could also take a small detail of something you say and exaggerate it into something that it's not. If you're having problems in your personal life, don't drag them in to feed off the drama.\nInstead, give them general answers if they ask about what is going on in your life. Keep everything pretty neutral, and don't go into detail about problems you are having with your spouse or behavioral issues with your children.\nHow to Deal With a Toxic Relationship\nHere are some tips on how to deal with a difficult partner.\nAcknowledge that you cannot change your toxic partner.\nSometimes, people in toxic relationships stay long because they hope they can help their partners change. It would be best if you let go of the idea that toxic people will change because of your assistance or insistence. It is essential to understand that you cannot change anyone, especially those who are toxic. The only thing that you can change is their impact on your life.\nIf you have to co-exist with someone toxic, you must realize that you only have the power to change your thoughts and actions. One thing that makes toxic people the way they are is that you can't reason with them. Their motives will never change from being selfish to being selfless.\nMaintain your boundaries.\nLike dealing with a toxic family member, you must set boundaries and assert them in relationships. Stand firm to these limits and let your partner know what is acceptable. Toxic people will make you work hard to please them, and before you know it, your boundary walls will have been demolished.\nBe aware of what you can tolerate and prepared to defend your boundary walls. You never need to explain your boundaries to others—you can say “no.” After you clear your boundaries, there is no need to discuss the topic further.\nSeek the lessons you must learn in the relationship.\nOften, people are brought to situations to teach them specific lessons on personal growth. Through\nmeditation, discover what the relationship is teaching you about yourself. Frequently, being in a toxic relationship will teach you about your limits. While every relationship has a little drama, a toxic relationship will make you aware of how much adversity you’re willing to face.\nYou will also learn to listen to the people who love you. Your friends aren't telling you that your partner isn't good for you because they're jealous of your relationship, they're telling you because they can see something that you can't through your rose-colored glasses. They're looking out for you. When leaving a toxic relationship, you will recognize that those who love you have had your best interest at heart.\nYou also learn not to compromise or sell yourself short. No longer will you be willing to give so much to a relationship and get little in return? You will think about your well-being and know the qualities to look out for in your next partner, as well as what to avoid.\nLearn to let go.\nSometimes, the only solution to regain your health and well-being is to extricate yourself from the toxic relationship.\n Being alone might be a better alternative to constantly being belittled. Reclaim your sense of worth. Believe that you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect and are worthy of love.\nFocus on yourself and the things that you want. Take your desires off hold, because you have likely been convinced you can't do the things you love anymore. Be true to yourself and start loving yourself in ways no one else can. Recognize the\nimportance of your peace of mind and that no one disturbs it should be in your life.\nIf you need more information,\nread our guide on how to leave a narcissist.

This means doing what you can to avoid working directly with them and having your office space as far away as possible.\nIf you\nwork near a toxic person, you will likely be the first person they come to when they need some attention. Not only is this distracting from your work, but the negativity will also start to bring you down. Avoid working near toxic people, and indeed, avoid working directly with them on projects as much as possible.\nCounter the negative with the positive.\nChoose to be with positive people in the workplace. Consciously choose your words to reflect only the\nbright side of things. Should the opportunity arise, always say something positive when others talk negatively about another co-worker, the boss, or the company you’re working for. (Remember, small minds discuss people.)\nJust like negativity, positivity can also be contagious. While this might not influence the behavior of the toxic co-worker, it can impact those around you who are also being brought down by the toxic person's negativity. Spread joy as much as you can to change the atmosphere in the office.\nRecharge from the negative influence with some self-care activities.\nWhen you’ve been surrounded the whole day at work by the negative energy of toxic co-workers, you can regain your balance with\nself-care activities.\nPracticing self-care means choosing activities that balance the impact of emotional stress, such as exercising, eating healthy meals, getting a whole night's sleep, practicing meditation or relaxation techniques, being creative, and learning how to self-soothe your emotional distress. Keeping your body physically and mentally healthy will reduce the toll that toxic people can take on your life.\nIf all else fails,\nhere are some tips on gracefully leaving a toxic workplace.\nA Final Word On Toxic People\nThe tips we just covered are a few ways to deal with a toxic person in any part of your life.\nFor them to be effective, you must be\nmindful of the moments you need to apply them. Try them for the next few weeks and see how they improve your health and well-being.\nRemember that no matter how much you love them, toxic people can only change if they want to. You can only offer them kindness and support. In the process, you must remember not to lose yourself to their demands or negative influence. Stand your ground.\nYou must constantly work on developing habits that increase your overall positivity. This way, you can better cope with negative people who drain your energy because you will have a lot of positivity in your reserves.\n Check out this post for a definitive list of habits that energize and keep you in the positive zone.\nIf, however, after reading this post, you realize that you may have\nsome toxic traits, here's our guide on how to stop being a toxic person, and you can also check out our roundup of toxic personality tests.

INQUIRER FILE PHOTO\nMANILA, Philippines — The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) condemned the bombing of a church in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).\nThe rights body stressed it denounces all acts of violence, especially those targeted against groups of certain religious beliefs, as these oppose the progress that has already been made in promoting religious freedom in the Philippines.\nADVERTISEMENT “It must be noted that last year, 05 December 2023, the CHR also issued a statement on the bombing of a Catholic Mass in Marawi City. This is the second time in a span of a few months that these bombings have occurred in places of worship in the BARMM,” it pointed out.\nFEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO Chief Justice orders probe into P6-million bribery case vs a Pasay judge NEWSINFO There’s a ‘footnote’ to Zubiri ouster NEWSINFO Rep.

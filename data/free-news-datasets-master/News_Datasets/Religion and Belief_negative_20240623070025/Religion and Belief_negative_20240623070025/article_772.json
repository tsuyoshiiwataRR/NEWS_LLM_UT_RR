    "text": "Makow- Cohabiting with a Monkey\nMay 25, 2024\nthe Church of Satan.They make their appetites and whims supreme and pronounce them god. These depraved freaks are the Illuminati. They run the world and want to degrade\nCohabiting with a Monkey\n(Revised from Aug 27, 2020)\nby Henry Makow Ph. D.\nI have a confession to make. I've been living with a monkey for most of my life.\nHis vulgarity is a constant embarrassment. It seems that at a young age, his mind was corrupted (programmed.)\nWhen he sees a beautiful female reporter on TV, he doesn't see a human being doing a job. He doesn't listen to the info. He is too busy undressing her. This is \"sex-obsessed George.\"\nWhen his best friends suffer some misfortune, there is a tinge of satisfaction. This is \"Schadenfreude George.\" Or should I say, \"Insecure George?\"\nParadoxically, George is not a jealous monkey. He accepts that there are smarter, more talented, more hard-working monkeys who are more deserving than him.\nAt other times, I think of George not as a monkey but as an airplane. I am his pilot. I have to fuel him up at least three times a day, clean his cabin and empty his toilets. I change his oil about once a week. Sometimes his batteries wear down so I give him a nap.\nI sit in the cockpit in front of a computer screen. George wants a drink. George needs stimulation. George is always \"wanting\" something.\nHe is always trying to increase his store of coupons (called \"money\") useful for getting the things George \"wants.\" If not that, he is checking his stocks, book sales, and twitter followers.\nEDUCATING GEORGE\nGeorge lives on a planet infested by his kind, a large zoo without cages. He is surrounded by bad examples. George is cohabiting with six billion monkeys.\nThe planet is ruled by a clique of evil monkeys who\"corrupt in order to control.\" They don't want simians like George challenging their supremacy. Everywhere George looks, he is encouraged to be his worst.\nPorn, violence, greed etc. are pushed in his face. George rarely gets accurate information or sees positive role models.\nI try to shield him from all the filth and instead expose him to truth and uplifting experiences.\nI wish I had home-schooled him. He wasted most of his life studying ... other monkeys.\nWHO IS GEORGE?\nAs you have probably guessed, George is an animal that has served as the vehicle for my consciousness for some 70 years. I figure he's got about 20 years left before he expires and I am reunited with God.\n(Apparently, the Creator has chosen this curious method of self-expression: Inject Himself into a higher Primate and hope the seed will grow. Unfortunately, this plan is in jeopardy.)\nGeorge is definitely not the virile young ape he was once. There are many signs of wear and tear.\nGeorge is so demanding that I often forget I am not him. That distinction is what distinguishes me from an ape. It's what makes me \"human.\"\nThe whole cosmic drama takes the form of domesticating our ape vehicles. I must regularly unplug the \"George\" computer. I want to experience myself, as a soul, instead of George.\nI must increase consciousness through meditation, prayer, and reading the Bible. \"The Lord is thy shepherd. Thou shalt not want.\" Hear that, George!?\nI wish George were more like a horse. Horses are vehicles by nature. They are graceful, peaceful and take direction.\nGeorge, why couldn't you have been a horse??",

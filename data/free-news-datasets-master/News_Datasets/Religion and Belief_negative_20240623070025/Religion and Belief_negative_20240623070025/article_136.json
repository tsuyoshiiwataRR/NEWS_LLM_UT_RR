    "text": "Friday 24 May 2024\nThe Archbishop of Armagh, the Most Revd John McDowell, addresses the Synod\nTHE Synod’s attempts to discuss mission and ministry were interrupted by an anti-transgender protest on behalf of an imprisoned former Church of Ireland schoolteacher (News 8 April 2023, 22 May 2023).\nTwo protesters entered the Synod chamber with a microphone and disrupted proceedings. The protesters, who also unfurled a banner, were the mother and brother of Enoch Burke, a former teacher at a church school who has been locked in an extended legal battle with both the school and the Irish courts over his refusal to use a transgender pupil’s new name and pronouns.\nAs Mr Burke continues to defy a court order compelling him to not enter the school grounds, he has repeatedly been imprisoned for contempt of court. His family members shouted questions at the Archbishop of Armagh, the Most Revd John McDowell, who refused to respond and immediately suspended the sitting of the Synod.\nAfter a few minutes, the protesters left the hotel where the Synod was meeting. Later, the members took their seats to resume the session. The police were called, but no arrests were made.\n10 Apr 2024\n09 Feb 2024\n01 May 2024\n03 May 2024\n19 Dec 2023\n22 Sep 2023\n24 May 2024\n21 May 2024\n22 May 2024\nA survivor writes about the emotionally exhausting process of making a CDM complaint out of time — only for it to be refused\nThe Church Times is looking for a new editor to succeed Paul Handley, who is retiring at the end of September 2024.\nLuton is one of the most diverse, multi-cultural, youthful, towns in the country.

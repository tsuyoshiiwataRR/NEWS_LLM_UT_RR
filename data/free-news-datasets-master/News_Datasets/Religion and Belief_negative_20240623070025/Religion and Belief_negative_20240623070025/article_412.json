    "text": "Walter “Wally” E. Vollenweider, age 80, of Munising, died on Thursday morning, May 16, 2024 under the loving care of his family and North Woods Hospice. He was born on May 22, 1943 in Monroe, Wisconsin, to the late Henry and Matilda Ann (Marty) Vollenweider. Wally graduated from Verona High School in 1961. As a young adult he developed a love for cars and especially cherished his Ford Galaxie 500. Wally started work at Marling Lumber Company in Verona and later became a self-employed manufacturing representative for multiple kitchen cabinet companies. His time in sales fostered multiple friendships that lasted his lifetime. Wally married Deborah Ann Benam on June 10, 1982 and together they raised their four children. Wally and Deb were charter members of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church in Green Bay. After retirement Wally and Deb made their beloved camp in the Upper Peninsula their permanent home. Wally loved 16-Mile Lake and the community that it provided. He was always willing to help a neighbor, go for a cruise on the boat, and collect sap to make maple syrup with many friends from around the lake. Wally was an avid hunter and loved his trips out west to Montana and Colorado elk hunting. Even after moving to the U.P. Wally looked forward to going back to Wisconsin for the opening gun season and to partake in his family’s deer hunting traditions. Wally loved his family very much and looked forward to his trips to visit his children, grandchildren, and extended family. He was a faithful member of Sacred Heart Catholic Church where he served as an altar server and usher. Wally was an active member of the Knights of Columbus and was a 4th Degree Knight. He was a great volunteer, advocate, and helped organize the Knights Sack Hunger initiative that provided food goods to St. Vincet de Paul and the Alger County Food Bank. Wally often encouraged and assisted the younger members of the church to be more involved and share in the mission of the Knights. Wally is survived by his children and their spouses - Jeffrey and Vicki Vollenweider of Kewaunee, WI, Maury and Retired Army Command Sergeant Major Jimmy Ledesma of New Braunfels, TX , Bradley Ward of Idaho, and Hans and Jenn Vollenweider of Marquette, grandchildren – First Lieutenant Jeffrey “J.J.” Vollenweider, Tyler (Sonia) Locust, Selena (Thomas) Burch, Senior Airman Roman Ledesma, Brian Ledesma, and Aubrey, Liana, and Emilia Vollenweider; great-grandchildren – Elisa, Helen, and Riley; sister – Carol (LaVerne) Thompson; brother – Steve Vollenweider; and numerous nieces, nephews and cousins. Wally was preceded in death by his parents – Henry and Ann; wife – Deb Vollenweider; and sister-in-law – Patti Vollenweider. Wally’s visitation will be on Friday, May 24, 2024 in Munising at the Bowerman Funeral Home from 11:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. Mass of Christian Burial will be concelebrated by Fr. Michael Ocran and Fr. Tim Ekaitis beginning at 3:00 p.m. at Sacred Heart Church. Interment will be at the Mt. Vernon Cemetery in Mt. Vernon, WI on Tuesday, May 28, 2024 at 1:00 p.m. CST. In lieu of flowers, memorials in Wally’s name may be directed to the family to donate to the Sacred Heart Church parish community. Wally’s obituary and online guestbook may be viewed and signed at\nbowermanfuneralhome.net. []\nWalter “Wally” E. Vollenweider\nWalter “Wally” E.

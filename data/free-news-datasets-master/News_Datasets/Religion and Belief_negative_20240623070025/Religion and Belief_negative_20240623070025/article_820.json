    "text": "(Article by Chris Menahan republished from [InformationLiberation.com](https://www.informationliberation.com/?id=64460)) From Israeli writer Jonathan Ofir in [Mondoweiss, \"Netanyahu's response to the ICC invokes another genocidal biblical reference\"](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/05/netanyahu-invoked-another-genocidal-biblical-reference-in-his-response-to-the-icc/): [F]or Netanyahu, the ICC news was an occasion to [once again]make allusions to the biblical war of extermination against \"Amalek.\" This was the same biblical reference Netanyahu [invoked in a statement on October 28]at the outset of the Israeli ground invasion in Gaza. \"Remember what Amalek did to you,\" he said, quoting the biblical verse where God commanded the Israelites to wipe out the enemy nation of the Amalekites down to their babies and animals. South Africa [submitted Netanyahu's statement]at the ICJ as evidence of Israel's genocidal intent in Gaza. Netanyahu declaring invasion: \"You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible\" 1 Samuel 15:3 \"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass\" [pic.twitter.com/5QF9PkGhjJ] — Michael Tracey (@mtracey) [October 28, 2023] This time, Netanyahu is using the same reference to rally the nation against its enemies — which apparently now includes the ICC — using coded language in the Hebrew version of his rant against the Court. Apparently, Netanyahu believes that if he makes his Amalek references more vaguely, that they will fly under the radar. BREAKING: Bibi addresses the ICC: “The absurd and false order of the prosecutor in The Hague is not only directed against the Prime Minister of Israel and the Minister of Defense - it is directed against the entire State of Israel. It is directed against the IDF soldiers, who… [pic.twitter.com/uV90tCEu8J] — Raylan Givens (@JewishWarrior13) [May 20, 2024] [...] [Contrary to Netanyahu's speech in English, Netanyahu's speech in Hebrew for Israeli consumption] ended with a Hebrew phrase — \"Netzah Israel lo yeshaker\" — which means \"the Eternal One of Israel shall not lie.\" This was the phrase he directed at \"the lies at The Hague,\" as he said in the statement. The significance of this phrase will not be apparent to the general public, as it draws upon loaded codes in both biblical and Zionist history and mythology. The phrase itself comes from Samuel I, 15:29. Context here is everything. King Saul was admonished by the prophet Samuel for not completely eradicating the Amalekites — Saul had spared their king Agag and \"the best of the sheep and cattle,\" which the Israelites \"were unwilling to destroy completely.\" According to the Bible, this level of annihilation was not enough and displayed King Saul's supposed weakness. That is why the Prophet Samuel admonished the biblical king: \"The Lord anointed you king over Israel. And he sent you on a mission, saying, 'Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until you have wiped them out.' Why did you not obey the Lord? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the Lord?\" Saul seeks to defend his actions, but Samuel delivers an uncompromising message: \"You have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you as king over Israel!\" Saul seeks forgiveness, but Samuel delivers the unrepentant message: \"The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors — to one better than you. He who is the Eternal One of Israel shall not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind.\" This was the sentence Netanyahu used at the end of his Hebrew address reacting to the ICC application. In other words, he is sending a message that he will not make the same mistake as King Saul by not completely eradicating Amalek. He will go all the way in Gaza. He will continue into Rafah. He will \"wipe off the seed of Amalek,\" as Israeli soldiers were \" recorded chanting back in December. You have to applaud Mondoweiss for exposing this as no one else in the media is reporting on it. In November, [they translated a disturbing open letter written in Hebrew signed by around 90 Israeli doctors which urged the Israel Defense Forces to bomb hospitals in Gaza.](https://www.informationliberation.com/?id=64110) Similarly, The Grayzone in March translated a piece in the Hebrew-only media detailing how [the Israeli lawyer who pushed the \"Hamas mass rapes\" hoax was accused of scamming donors of millions of dollars.](https://www.informationliberation.com/?id=64352) Israeli reporter David Sheen in March also [exposed how Israel's top rabbi in Jaffa issued a call in Hebrew to genocide all Palestinians in Gaza and said the Torah demands the killing of men, women, children and even babies.](https://www.informationliberation.com/?id=64328) Read more at: [InformationLiberation.com](https://www.informationliberation.com/?id=64460)",

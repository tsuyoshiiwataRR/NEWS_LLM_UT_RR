    "text": "1928-2024\nMaureen Tod died peacefully in her 96th year, surrounded by her family, on Monday, May 13, 2024. Predeceased by her beloved husband, Charles (1925-2012). She leaves her daughter Cynthia, and her daughter Melanie and son-in-law Dr Don Brooks to love her forever.\nMaureen was a force of nature — smart, quick, friendly, pretty, hard working, effective, genuine, both frugal and generous, gracious, kind, oh so funny, sweet, and always loving. Whatever she did she did with vigour and humour. She could do anything she tried — square and round dancing, bridge, X-C skiing, entertaining, cooking, cottage life, world travel, organizing, leadership in life and in volunteering, gardening, knitting (100s of pairs of mittens for cold children) and loving her family and her dogs with gusto. She was a devoted wife, a great mom and a fine human being. She will be sorely missed.\nA memorial service will be held in the chapel of Hulse Playfair & McGarry, 315 McLeod St., Ottawa, on Thursday, May 30 at 3:30 p.m., followed by a reception. For Livestream of the service please visit\nwww.hpmcgarry.ca. For those who wish to make a donation in Maureen's memory please consider the Ottawa Hospital Foundation, or the Humane Society of Ottawa.\nCondolences/Tributes/Donations\nwww.hpmcgarry.ca\n613-233-1143\nPublished online May 25, 2024\nIn Memory of Maureen (nee Warren)When is the\n[ordering deadline?](javascript:void(0))\nIn Memory of Maureen (nee Warren)How does\n[it work?](javascript:void(0))\nSend Flowers: When Is the Ordering Deadline?\nANY DAY OF THE WEEK\nOrder any time up till the day before\nMON-FRI Order by 2:00PM\nSAT & SUN Order by noon\nTUES-SAT\nOrder by 3:00PM\nThe day before\nSAT & SUN Order by Saturday\nNote: These are general guidelines; some florists may not be able to operate within these timelines.

    "text": "MANILA, Philippines — The camp of Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) founder Apollo Quiboloy surrendered 21 firearms in Davao City yesterday.\nThe firearms – 18 handguns, two rifles and a shotgun – were turned over by KOJC representatives to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) at the religious sect’s compound in Barangay Sasa at around 6:30 a.m.\nMaj. Gen. Leo Francisco, CIDG director, said the firearms are registered under the name of Cresente Canada, one of the co-accused in the child abuse and qualified human trafficking cases filed against Quiboloy before the courts in Davao and Pasig cities.\nApart from the firearms, the KOJC also turned over 14 bullets for a .9mm caliber handgun and two CZ pistol magazines.\n“Active participation of the community and the public is essential in our fight against illegal firearms for a safer, secure nation,” Francisco said in a statement.\nThe firearms were brought to the CIDG-Davao field office for documentation and safekeeping.\nEarly this month, Quiboloy’s camp also surrendered five of 19 registered firearms.",

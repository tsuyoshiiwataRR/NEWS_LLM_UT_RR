    "text": "Politics SA tainted itself by overlooking Hamas' crimes: SA Jewish Board of Deputies 24 May 2024 - 19:13 Ernest Mabuza Journalist A woman looks at memorabilia and pictures of the hostages kidnapped in the deadly October 7 attack on Israel by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, at Dizengoff Square in Tel Aviv, Israel, May 16, 2024.\nImage: REUTERS/Nir Elias\nSouth Africa could have done more to prevent loss of life in the conflict between Israel and Hamas from the outset through its relationship with Hamas rather than ongoing legal challenges.\nThis is the reaction by the South African Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled in South Africa’s favour against Israel on Friday, ordering that the Jewish state halt its military offensive in Rafah.\nSAJBD director Wendy Kahn said South Africa, with its history of engagement to resolve conflict, could have engaged with Hamas after October 7 last year after Hamas' attack on Israel when it took 252 people hostage.\nAfter the attack, Israel launched a military offensive in Gaza which has led to a loss of thousands of lives. South African then brought an application before the ICJ on December 29 alleging violation by Israel of its obligations under the Genocide Convention in relation to Palestinians in Gaza.\nKahn said every loss of life in the conflict between Israel and Hamas was tragic.\n“Over the past seven months of this heartbreaking war, it has become increasingly obvious that peace needs to be made through political negotiations and not legal institutions,” Kahn said.\nShe said this was because the ICJ had no jurisdiction over Hamas.\nKahn said professor emeritus Andre Thomashausen had repeatedly stated that “thus far, with all its cases, South Africa has not saved one life”.\nIn its many statements, interviews and speeches, the South African government had made against Israel, it had not once commented on the bodies of Israeli hostages that had been reportedly found in Gaza, including three in Rafah in the past week, Kahn said.\n“Neither have they acknowledged or condemned Hamas footage also found in Rafah this week, showing sexual threats by Hamas against young Israeli women captives.”\nShe said South Africa had forever tainted itself in its willingness to overlook the horrendous crimes of Hamas, damaging its reputation as an honest peace broker.\nTimesLIVE",

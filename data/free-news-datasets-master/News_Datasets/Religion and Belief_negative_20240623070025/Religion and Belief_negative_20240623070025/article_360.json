    "text": "Kolkata: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday claimed that the Hindu dharma of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is different from the “true” Hinduism of India.\nBanerjee also announced that her government will approach a higher court, challenging the Calcutta High Court order that cancelled OBC certificates of several classes issued in the state since 2010.\nAt a rally in Canning in South 24 Parganas district, Banerjee said she apprehended that Modi was conspiring to roll out NRC and Uniform Civil Code and take away reservation of SC, ST and OBC people.\n“Modi’s Hindu dharma is not Bharat’s true Hindu dharma. My religion teaches me to work for amity and harmony… Modi believes in the dharma of conflict between communities,” the TMC boss said.\nShe claimed that the vote schedule was planned in such a way that 2000-odd Muslims would not be able to vote as they would go to Haj pilgrimage.\nThe chief minister said she observes fast on certain days according to Hindu rituals and also attends festivals of Muslim, Christian and other religions.\n“Cut any part of my body, the blood will not label me as Hindu, Muslim or a member of any other community. It will prove I am a human,” she said.\nEarlier, addressing an election rally at Sagar in South 24 Parganas district, she said the state government would move the higher court after summer vacation.\n“We do not accept the order that scrapped OBC certificates. We will contest it at a higher court after summer vacation,” Banerjee said.\nThe Calcutta High Court on Wednesday struck down as illegal the OBC status of several classes in West Bengal granted since 2010, sparking a political debate in the middle of the Lok Sabha elections.\nThe court observed that the inclusion of 77 classes of Muslims in the list of backward categories was to “treat them as a vote bank”.\nWithout naming any judge, Banerjee said at another rally at Raydighi, “Someone is taking away jobs of teachers, someone else is joining BJP after delivering certain judgments while somebody else is cancelling OBC certificates which were issued as per constitutional norms.”\nThe chief minister said she will not comment on the judiciary, but the order came when Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been alleging that the opposition INDIA bloc, if voted to power in the Lok Sabha elections, would scrap the quotas of the SC, ST and OBC people, Banerjee said.\n“Did BJP tell you something before passing the order?” she asked without referring to anyone.\nBanerjee also asserted that all constitutional norms were followed while making the rule that allowed inclusion of the classes in the OBC list.\nShe accused BJP of hatching conspiracies in Sandeshkhali and other places during the election for political reasons.\nThe chief minister alleged that the BJP was taking carloads of cash in different parts of the state, where the coming two phases of polls will be held, and asked people to inform the police if they come across any such instance.\nStating that Rs 24 lakh in cash was recovered from one car, she said, “I am afraid BJP will resort to more such unfair means to buy votes.”\nBanerjee accused central agencies of harassing TMC leaders in cattle and coal smuggling cases.\nThough the responsibility of guarding international borders lies with the Centre, no union minister was held responsible, she said.\nAsserting TMC is fighting BJP alone in Bengal, Banerjee alleged that Congress and CPI(M) are helping the BJP in the state.\n“We will play a big role in forming the INDIA bloc’s government at the Centre. But we have to see that (anti-BJP) votes are not split in Bengal,” she added.\nThe CM said the state has framed a master plan for the development of Sunderbans and save the coastline.\nReferring to Sandeshkhali, where allegations of atrocities on women were raised by local TMC leaders, Banerjee alleged that her party’s legislators were manhandled by the police of BJP-ruled states when they had gone there to protest against riots and incidents of rape.\nClaiming that seven-phase polls over two and half months as “unprecedented in the world,” she alleged that the EC was forced to do it at the behest of Modi to help him return to power but that will not happen as BJP will not cross even 200 seat figure.\nBanerjee said one of the three Election Commissioners had stepped down in protest against such an anti-people move by the BJP government at the Centre.\n“If Modi comes back to power there will not be any more elections and there will be a one-party, one community, one system rule and no democracy,” she said.\nShe said due to the geographical location of West Bengal, natural calamities like cyclones have been a regular occurrence, and the state government has taken all steps to mitigate the suffering s of the people.",

    "text": "PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Thursday warned NGOs and activists against making objectionable statements on any religion or gods. Sawant said that govt has received complaints that some NGOs engage in extortion.Sawant said that strict action will be taken against such organisations. He said control must be exercised on NGOs run for personal gain by some individuals and their families.\\\"We will register FIRs against those making irresponsible statements and action will be taken as stipulated by law,\\\" Sawant said. People creating hatred among Hindus, Muslims, Christians, and other religious groups will not be spared, he said.\\\"NGOs should bear in mind that govt will act against them for controversial statements,\\\" Sawant said. He said that NGOs of good standing in the state are running schools and colleges, but some NGOs set up by individuals work only to further their interests.Often, two family members form an NGO and start making controversial statements on social media. We have received complaints of extortion against some NGOs,” Sawant said. “NGOs go to people and offer to settle problems. People are afraid of being attacked on social media, so they pay the NGOs. People should not fall prey to such tricks and should file police complaints. Govt will take action.” Sawant was reacting to the controversial statements made by Shreya Dhargalkar against the devotees of Goddess Lairai from Shirgao, and her disparaging comments on the members of the management committee of Shri Shantadurga Kunkallikarin Temple of Fatorpa. “I condemned the controversial statements of Dhargalkar and other such persons,” Sawant said. He said that such people create NGOs ostensibly to help the public but make controversial statements after receiving money from certain quarters. “I will not point to particular persons, but govt will not keep quiet in such circumstances. Based on my instruction, Cuncolim police arrested Dhargalkar and all the necessary penal sections were invoked,” he said. “Bicholim police have registered a case. She has been remanded in judicial custody till June 4.” The chief minister said the message is now clear — govt will crack down on those making objectionable statements on religions. “Today, anybody with a mobile phone posts thoughts on social media,” Sawant said. “But if their statements are controversial, govt will not keep quiet.”",

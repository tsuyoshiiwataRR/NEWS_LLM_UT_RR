    "text": "Sunday, May 5, my brother David and I attended the Holocaust Remembrance Day service at our local synagogue, Congregation Sons of Abraham, in La Crosse. While Rabbi Brian Serle spoke of the Holocaust or Shoah \"in light of the Oct. 7 massacre\", a fire alarm began to chirp intermittently. It had not ever done so before. The purpose of a fire alarm is to detect and warn of the danger of fire. In this instance though, perhaps due to a low battery, instead of being an annoying distraction, it sounded a warning to me of a very different kind: the alarming rise of anti-Israel, anti-Jewish sentiment in America and the world today. Where there's smoke, there's fire. The dispeaceful, unlawful, vandalistic, and violent protests in our cities, colleges and universities are symptomatic of a deeper, more insidious malaise. It has been allowed to fester, individually and institutionally, unchallenged and unhindered in our educational system, the boardrooms of corporations and the halls of both Congress and Senate, aided and abetted even by some churches, synagogues and mosques. People are also readingâ€¦ As a Christian I am admonished to be vigilant and watchful, not \"hiding my eyes\" from the reality of evil in the world, human nature and the personification of evil, Satan. I am reminded of what Jesus said: \"Can you not discern the signs of the times?\" And as the apostle Paul wrote: \"See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise. Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.\" Mark Eugene Millich, La Crosse",

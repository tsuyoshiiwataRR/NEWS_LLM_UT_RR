    "text": "The Telegraph Russell Group apologises after suggesting gender-critical beliefs akin to anti-Semitism Neil Johnston May 24, 2024 at 3:12 p.m. · 3 min read Link Copied Read full article The Russell Group, which represents 24 top universities including Oxford and Cambridge, has apologised for the 'serious error' - William Conran/PA Archive\nThe Russell Group of elite universities has been forced to make an about-turn after likening those with gender-critical beliefs to anti-Semites and Islamophobes.\nThe organisation, which represents 24 top universities including Oxford and Cambridge, has apologised after being accused of stifling free speech with a consultation response which said universities should restrict gender-critical speech.\nThe Office for Students (OfS), which acts as the higher education regulator, launched a consultation on guidance on free speech on campus in March.\nUniversities and other organisations have been given until this week to respond to the consultation. In its response, the Russell Group said that “universities would be expected to take steps to restrict” unlawful speech.\nThe initial response went on to say examples “including anti-Semitic, Islamophobic or gender-critical speech” should be included in the OfS’s guidance on free speech on campus .\nThe organisation later retracted the claim and changed its submission to read to suggest that the guidance include examples of transphobic speech, rather than gender-critical speech.\nThe group made the change after a furious backlash from academics and free speech campaigners who branded its submission “unacceptable prejudice”.\nProfessor Jo Phoenix, who won an employment tribunal for constructive dismissal over her gender-critical views, said the response was 'legally illiterate' - John Lawrence\nGender-critical beliefs are the conviction that people cannot change their biological sex.\nProfessor Jo Phoenix, who won an employment tribunal for constructive dismissal over her gender-critical views , told the Daily Mail the response was “legally illiterate”.\nShe said: “Russell Group leadership either does not care about academic freedom or is legally illiterate, and it is unacceptable prejudice to class gender-critical beliefs in the same category as racism and Islamophobia.”\nThe Free Speech Union, which advocates for freedom of speech and defends those whose right to expression has been violated, said: “Forty per cent of the cases we’ve taken on this year have involved gender-critical feminists getting into trouble for saying something perfectly reasonable that a majority of people would agree with, e.g. male sex offenders shouldn’t be housed in women’s prisons, even if they claim to have ‘transitioned’.”\nNew free speech duties The consultation was launched over changes to legislation on free speech . Under existing legislation universities and colleges are required to take reasonably practicable steps to secure free speech on campus.\nHowever laws passed in May last year impose new free speech duties on universities and colleges, their constituent institutions and some students’ unions.\nThe duties, which come into force in August, include a similar duty to take reasonably practicable steps to secure free speech on campus .\nThe new legislation will also give the OfS more powers and duties to regulate universities and colleges, and their students’ unions, on free speech issues.\nA spokesperson for the Russell Group said: “Our original submission to the OfS consultation on free speech guidance contained a serious error, incorrectly listing gender-critical speech as an example of unlawful speech. We apologise unreservedly for this error and we have republished our corrected summary.\n“This error in wording was a genuine mistake, and should not have been included in the document. We take our duties on freedom of speech seriously, and all our universities are committed to defending and upholding freedom of speech for everyone in their community.”",

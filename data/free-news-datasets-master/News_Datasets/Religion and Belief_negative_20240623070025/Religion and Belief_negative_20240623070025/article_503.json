    "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa â€” The Mississippi man accused of destroying a Satanic Temple display at the Iowa State Capitol last year took a plea deal Friday in order to have a felony hate crime charge dropped. Former congressional candidate [Michael Cassidy, 35](https://www.weareiowa.com/article/news/crime/iowa-satanic-display-state-capitol-building-vandalism-suspect/524-f3f795f7-aeaa-4d5e-976e-fd6ca57f40a5), vandalized a statue of Baphomet and tore down the temple's display in December 2023. That act earned him one charge of Criminal Mischief in the Third Degree, a Class D felony. On Friday, his attorney filed a guilty plea to an aggravated misdemeanor count of that same charge on his behalf, admitting fault in order to avoid the felony hate crime charge under [Iowa Code 729.A2](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/code/729A.2.pdf). The plea deal results in a deferred judgment for Cassidy with two years probation, an $855 civil penalty and undetermined restitution costs to pay. Local 5 News confirmed the display was built with the state's full permission. [Gov. Kim Reynolds](https://governor.iowa.gov/press-release/2023-12-12/gov-reynolds-statement-satanic-temple-display) called the display \"objectionable,\" while organizers said it was a symbol of their right to religious freedom. Lucien Greaves, co-founder of the [Satanic Temple](https://thesatanictemple.com/), spoke to Local 5 about what the display stands for back in December. \"The First Amendment is very important in our ability to be able to identify how we do and coexist peacefully with people while being openly about who we are,\" Greaves said. \"That's why we are often seeking representation in public forums.\" Cassidy could also be required to participate in a victim-offender dialogue with the temple, if requested.",

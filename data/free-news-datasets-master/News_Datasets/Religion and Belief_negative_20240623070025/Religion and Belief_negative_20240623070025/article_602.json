    "text": "In a strong reaction to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s controversial remarks about globally renowned Sanatani spiritual institutions like Bharat Sevashram Sangha and Ramakrishna Mission, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath claimed that the entire Indi Alliance, including the Congress, TMC, RJD, and SP, were engaged in anti-Hindu politics.\nTalking to the media in the Gorakhnath Temple complex before leaving for Ballia to campaign for the Lok Sabha elections on Saturday morning, CM Adityanath accused the alliance of prioritising power over nation. “These parties want power at the cost of the country and no Indian will accept this”, he remarked.\nReferring to the controversial statement made by TMC chief Mamata Banerjee against Bharat Sevashram Sangh and Ramakrishna Mission in West Bengal, the CM emphasised that both organisations were esteemed religious and spiritual institutions in India. He praised Ramakrishna Mission, which follows the ideals of Swami Vivekananda, for its commendable work in promoting the values and principles of Sanatan Dharma and India’s spiritual heritage across the country and the world.\n“Similarly, Bharat Sevashram Sangha is an influential spiritual organization, which has done commendable work in promoting the values and principles of Sanatan Dharma both within India and globally, following the ideals of Swami Pranavananda. Both organizations have also acted in advancement of numerous service projects worldwide”, he stated.\nThe CM further pointed that opposing Sanatan Dharma and Hindus, is the foundation of the politics of the Indi Alliance and all its constituents including Congress, SP, TMC, RJD and Aam Aadmi Party and the statements made by its leaders, including Mamata Banerjee, reflected their frustration over their impending defeat.\nPraising Ramakrishna Mission and Bharat Sevashram Sangha for their extensive efforts in promoting spirituality and culture through commendable service projects, both in India and around the world, the CM cited Swami Vivekananda, who had proudly declared, “We should say with pride that we are Hindus.”\nAdityanath stated that the followers and devotees of these esteemed organizations will give a befitting reply to Congress, TMC, and the Indi Alliance. He compared the current situation to the era of Ravana when sages were threatened, asserting that Sanatan Dharma will not be intimidated by such provocations and will respond in a decisive manner.\nThe CM stated that while the Indi Alliance parties were threatening Hindu religious and spiritual institutions, they were also undermining the rights of backward caste people.\nHe pointed out that in 2010, the TMC government in West Bengal diluted OBC reservations by including 118 Muslim castes in the OBC category, depriving millions of individuals from backward castes of reservation benefits over the past 14 years. He demanded an apology from Mamata Banerjee’s TMC government and Congress for this injustice meted out to the OBC community.\nHe emphasised that taking away the rights of youth and citizens was unacceptable and contrary to the principles of Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar, who clearly stated that reservations should not be based on religion.\nThe CM stated that implementing reservations based on religion was part of a conspiracy to further divide India. He praised the Kolkata High Court’s decision, calling it highly commendable. This ruling, he added, is a strong rebuke to the TMC, Congress, and other Indi Alliance parties.",

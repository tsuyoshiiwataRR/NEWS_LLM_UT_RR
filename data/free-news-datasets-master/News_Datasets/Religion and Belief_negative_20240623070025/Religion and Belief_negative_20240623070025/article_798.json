    "text": "Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Dr. Mohan Yadav has once again initiated action, leading to the removal of loudspeakers from religious places in Shajapur city on Saturday. Around 77 loudspeakers have been taken down from 77 religious sites. Along with this, instructions have been given to obtain mandatory permission from the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) before installing even a single loudspeaker at any religious establishment. Unregulated loudspeakers removed from religious places As per the orders of the Chief Minister, Yashpal Singh Rajput, Superintendent of Police, Shajapur and the APU and station in-charges of the district, removed the unregulated loudspeakers from various religious sites in Shajapur district on Saturday. These loudspeakers were found to be operating without proper control and in violation of regulations. In total, 77 loudspeakers were removed from religious places across the district, and the concerned authorities of the religious places were advised to seek permission from the SDM before installing any new loudspeakers. CM Mohan Yadav's earlier action on loudspeakers It is worth mentioning that hours after assuming the office of the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh last year, Mohan Yadav has prioritised reducing noise pollution in the state. He had issued an order on December 13 to remove illegal loudspeakers. After this, loudspeakers were removed from mosques and temples everywhere in the state. However, the measures were taken only against the unregulated loudspeakers. The regulated loudspeakers were allowed to operate within prescribed decibel limits, and at prescribed times. With time, this campaign slowed down and loudspeakers were again mounted over the top of some religious places. But he had again given strict orders to the officials on Friday following which, the work of removing loudspeakers was done on Saturday. Apart from removing loudspeakers from religious places, the action was also taken on DJs played in weddings and processions to control noise pollution.

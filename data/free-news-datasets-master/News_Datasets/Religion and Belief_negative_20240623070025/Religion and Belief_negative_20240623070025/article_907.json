    "text": "Reports of the destruction of religious houses of prayer in the media and what this implies as a society tell us much about where that society is heading. The destruction of statues—Hindu, Catholic, Orisa—or of the building and its contents points to a particular frame of mind.\nMany people immediately think it points to a deranged mind—the person is mad or crazy. That might well be so. But mental illness in itself points to other causes—homelessness, illiteracy, unemployment, underdevelopment, toxicity in the home, unresolved trauma.\nNobody enjoys being “mad” or “crazy”, and just as we attend to diabetic conditions, high blood pressure and cholesterol, so, too, should we attend to mental issues as just another health issue. Sadly, even among the well-educated, seeing a mental health professional is still regarded as taboo.\nBut for the most part, I think desecration of sacred spaces has to do with fanaticism over a monopoly over religious truth. It seems to me that Hindus appear to be the victims more frequently than any other religious group.\nPrioritising religious truth aggressively and angrily often arises when a society becomes secular and religion is pushed to the periphery. We hardly find “Merry Christmas” cards around Christmas time—instead, “Happy Holidays”. The Christian greeting itself is seen as offensive as one is accused of imposing one’s religious beliefs on someone else.\nMonopoly over religious truth was once a central doctrine of Christianity: “Nulla salus extra ecclesiam”—“No salvation outside the Church”. I need not go into the destructive implications of that doctrine through forced evangelisation and slavery. The Catholic church no longer holds to that position.\nBut others do. When the world becomes too secular—“disenchanted”, as philosopher Charles Taylor would say—that is, uprooted from its religious moorings, voices arise, often violently and fanatically, to re-enchant it by force. It becomes: I am right and you are wrong, and because you are wrong, you have no right to exist, because you are preaching falsehood.\nThis is what happens in all fundamentalisms—Islamic, Hindu, Christian, etc. If I exist, you must not. This is one of the reasons why religion has been rejected in the West. People prefer to see themselves as “spiritual but not religious”, as good social humanists, to avoid the entanglements of a religion that is bent on hurting or humiliating the other.\nThe Catholic church no longer preaches a monopoly over truth. Jesus never said he was the only way; he said he was “the way” (Jn 14:6). That leaves the way open for other ways. This is what the fanatical religious mind rejects. It’s the “either/or” mentality of the West and not the “and/with” mentality of the East.\nI feel particularly sorry for Hindus since they appear to be, from my reading the newspapers, the more frequent victims of these attacks. I think this is connected to a popular religious outlook that sees Christianity as moral and good and Hinduism as unethical and idolatrous. This is subtly transferred into the political sphere around national elections time as to which political party is good and which one is bad.\nHindus are accused of worshipping 33 million gods. Well, since there are over two billion Christians in the world and we all understand Jesus differently, I suppose there are over two billions Jesuses, so Christians are in a worse situation.\nThis tragedy of destruction of statues points to the urgent need for comparative religion or religious studies in schools as an academic subject—not subjects demanding belief, but rather, knowledge of content. In studies done in the US in recent years, atheists were the ones who knew most about religion, including Catholicism.\nIt is true that one cannot understand the inner spiritual core of any religion without being a practising believer, but there is no harm in understanding the tenets of the religions in this country. We, more than any other country on the face of the earth, should be inclined to encourage this, since we have no history of post-independence religious or ethnic violence. We don’t kill people here based on race or religion.\nAnother important factor to bear in mind is the transferring of the commercial mentality into the realm of faith. As Fr Henry Charles wrote:\n“Part of the difficulty people experience is seeing faith as a private possession—in a way, almost like transferring the notion of private property to faith. If it’s mine, it can’t be yours. Whatever is had in common cannot be mine. If we are the beneficiaries of revelation in its fullest sense, that is something we have on lease, not something we possess by freehold, and the rights to belong extend to the entire human family. Here, if anywhere, the more people with access, the merrier.”\nThe author is a Roman Catholic priest and\ncathedral administrator",

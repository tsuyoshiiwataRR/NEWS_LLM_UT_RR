    "text": "Nagpur: Deputy CM and home minister Devendra Fadnavis emphasized on the need to move industries away from residential zones while answering a question in the aftermath of a massive fire in Dombivli industrial area which killed 8 people and injured many.On leader of opposition Ambadas Danve’s demand to relocate housing areas, Fadnavis said, “Discussions for relocating those are underway for over the years. The previous govt under ex-CM Uddhav Thackeray did nothing during its entire tenure. I understand the seriousness of the issue and that existing industries must be provided land for shifting.”Contradicting Fadnavis, Nana Patole said the MVA government had in fact ordered closure of these factories, but said corruption allowed them to continue. “It is the responsibility of the government to protect lives of people,” Patole said.We also published the following articles recentlyMaharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis tops rally tally at 116Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis held a record 116 public rallies for Mahayuti candidates across Maharashtra for the Lok Sabha seats, with a focus on Vidharbha.110346110MVA, govt in blame game over chem units relocation156 chemical industrial units from Dombivli MIDC are to be relocated to Patalganga in Raigad district.

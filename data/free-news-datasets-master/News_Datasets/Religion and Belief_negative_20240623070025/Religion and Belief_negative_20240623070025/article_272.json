    "text": "Iran is well known to claim that times of misfortune in the West are Allah’s punishment. How will the regime reconcile such claims with the fiasco at Ebrahim Raisi’s funeral?\nMourners attacked German journalists during Raisi’s funeral procession. The Iranian regime’s supporters have claimed that “the journalists aimed to falsely portray a low turnout at the funeral.”\n“German Journalists Attacked at Iranian President’s Funeral,” Iran International , May 23, 2024:\nMourners at the funeral procession of Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran on Wednesday assaulted a news team from Germany’s television.\nThe German ARD news crew was targeted while filming buses that had brought pro-regime participants to the capital.\nAccording to a foreign reporter covering the funeral, there was no apparent provocation that justified the assault by Raisi’s mourners.\n“It remains unclear what narrative might have incited such anger among the attendees,” the reporter stated, highlighting the arbitrary nature of the aggression……\nMeanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz sent condolences in a message addressed to Iranian Vice President Mohammad Mokhber, who is now acting president. The message said: “Our condolences go to the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the families of those killed in the crash.” Once again, a Western leader demonstrates no recognition of what the Iranian regime is, as well as extreme insensitivity to its victims. Such a gesture is akin to sending condolences to Nazi Germany after Hitler committed suicide.\nCheering and celebrations of the helicopter crash in which Raisi was killed continued in Iran, drawing death threats from the regime. Amid cheers over Raisi’s death, there was also mockery. An Iranian army offer who split his pants while acting as a pallbearer during the funeral didn’t escape notice:\nDuring the live broadcast of the funeral held in Tehran for Raisi and his companions on Wednesday, an Iranian Army honor guard is seen ripping his pants while carrying the coffin of Iran’s Foreign Minister @Amirabdolahian who was killed in the Sunday helicopter crash. pic.twitter.com/jGemMOJG7l\n— Iran International English (@IranIntl_En) May 22, 2024\nAlso, Raisi’s successor as president reportedly did his first public speech unzipped.\nAmid the humiliations and despite the demise of the “Butcher of Tehran,” Iran is a brutal regime that will regroup as the contest begins among contenders for power.\nIran’s president Ebrahim Raeesi leaves a legacy of brutal repression and complicity in 1988 mass executions.\nYet Iran’s repressive machinery goes beyond the power of the president. Absent fundamental change, these violations can be expected to continue. https://t.co/JdpqykEViR pic.twitter.com/F3POr7xlIO\n— Human Rights Watch (@hrw) May 21, 2024\nOne of the well-recognized contenders for the presidency is former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. His “former exorcist” has stated that Ahmadinejad “regularly holds secret meetings with his new team in preparation for the 2025 presidential election, and intends to make a comeback.”",

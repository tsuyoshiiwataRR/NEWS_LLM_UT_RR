    "text": "BENZIE COUNTY, Mich., (WPBN/WGTU) -- The Benzie County Sheriff's Office is investigating an incident that took place at the home of an elected official. Four rocks with religious messages written on them were thrown through multiple windows, sending glass everywhere and damaging the furniture inside. Amy Ferris and her husband live in a pretty secluded neighborhood. It's hard to reach their home, but that didn't stop someone from finding it and sending them a message. \"In my sleep I don't know what I thought it was, but my husband of course started screaming and I jumped out of bed,\" said Ferris. \"At first we I mean, it's so incomprehensible that somebody would do this to you. I thought it was a bear trying to break in.\" Ferris is the Crystal Lake Township Supervisor, and she's served as an elected official for more than a decade. In the early morning hours of May 18, she and her husband found their living area covered in shards of glass. Deputies arrived and pointed out to Ferris the rocks thrown through her living room had a message written on them: the word \"repent\" and a drawing of a cross. I don't know what this message really means. According to the deputy's report, the wording on the rocks leads him to believe this was \"a personal attack and potentially motivated by some moral/ethical conflict.\" Ferris believes the same. \"I don't think it was random. It was definitely targeting me,\" Ferris said. Ferris and the sheriff's office are unsure of a motive. In her role as an elected official, she said she's made a lot of decisions over the years that could've upset someone. \"I was scared to come in the room for most of the rest of the weekend,\" said Ferris. \"Just all of a sudden it was like a foreign territory to me. It's not a room that I wanted to go in.\"",

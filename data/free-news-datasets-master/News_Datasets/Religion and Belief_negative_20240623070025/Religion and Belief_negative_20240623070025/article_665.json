    "text": "People Who Hated Prophet Muhammad Introduction: Let’s dive into the time of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the people who didn’t like Islam back then. It’s crucial to understand who they were and why they opposed the Prophet and his teachings. Identifying Those Against Islam: Back then, there were folks who didn’t believe in Islam or didn’t want it to spread. They came from different groups and had various reasons for not liking Islam. The Quraysh and Other Tribes: The main opponents were from a powerful tribe called the Quraysh, based in Mecca. They didn’t like Islam because it challenged their position and how things were in society. Other tribes also joined in because they didn’t want to lose their power. Jewish and Christian Groups: Some Jewish and Christian groups didn’t like Islam either. Some disagreed with its teachings, while others were worried about losing their influence if Islam grew stronger. They often teamed up with the Quraysh and other opponents to stop Islam from spreading. People Who Pretended: There were also people who pretended to follow Islam but didn’t really believe in it. They caused trouble within the Muslim community by pretending to be believers when they weren’t. Foreign Powers: Outside of Arabia, big empires didn’t like Islam either. They saw it as a threat to their power. They tried to stop it from spreading by fighting against Muslims. Prophet Muhammad’s Response: Even with all these challenges, Prophet Muhammad and his friends stayed strong. They stayed patient and sometimes had to defend themselves, but they never gave up spreading Islam. Conclusion: Back in the time of the Prophet, there were lots of people who didn’t like Islam for different reasons. But Prophet Muhammad and his friends stayed strong and kept spreading Islam. Their determination inspires us today. Learn Quran Thanks for reading!

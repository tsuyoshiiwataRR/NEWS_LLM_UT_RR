    "text": "In Kennedy's view, there is no evidence to suggest that Israel is doing anything wrong with the way it is bombing and dropping white phosphorus on the people of Gaza, who are dying by the thousands as Israel Defense Forces (IDF) crusade their way to victory. \"I don't think Israel's intention is genocide,\" Kennedy told Brand. \"I don't believe there's any evidence of genocide.\" Kennedy then proceeded to parrot the same claim recently made by Israel that the Zionist state is the very best when it comes to protecting civilian lives amid constant war. \"The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) has protected civilians better than any army in history,\" Kennedy said. RFK Jr. on Russell Brand's podcast: \"I don't think Israel's intention is genocide. I don't believe there's any evidence of genocide…The IDF has protected civilians better than any army in history.\" [pic.twitter.com/TzHWpa5DpX] — Prem Thakker (@prem_thakker) [May 15, 2024] (Related: RFK Jr. still considers Israel to be a \"moral\" nation despite its ongoing war campaign in Gaza.) If it stopped there, he might be able to get away with it. But Kennedy also believes that what is happening in Gaza right now is not a genocide against Palestinians but a genocide against Jews. Even though the targets of IDF are all non-Jewish, Kennedy somehow convinced himself that it is Jews who are being slaughtered by the tens of thousands in that tiny land strip known as Gaza.

In the comments on several videos and X re-postings of Kennedy making these and other bizarre statements, people wondered what the 2024 presidential hopeful is thinking. \"Is he on some heavy drugs or has he lost touch with reality?\" one said. \"The third option: Zionist brainwashing,\" responded another. On X, someone claimed that IDF has already killed more civilians than any other army in history has for a war of this size. In the video below, listen as Max Blumenthal shares some of his own insights about Kennedy: Some insights on RFK Jr, from Max Blumenthal. full video: [pic.twitter.com/4iwRDNFe4x] — David Windt (@DavidLWindt) [May 15, 2024] \"I disagree vehemently with Max on things like the ridiculous scam for black reparations but I couldn't be any more impressed or have more respect for Max's courage, relentlessness, wealth of knowledge, and the ability to convey such rage-inducing thoughts in a crystal-clear representation of actual reality,\" one very impressed X user wrote about Blumenthal's words in the above video. \"He may be biased a little bit towards Palestine because from my point of view, you can never place any of these groups – any of them – in some type of pure vault where there's somehow always the victim no one hears who is always a victim, but what Israel's doing is not even in the same galaxy.\" This person went on to write that while many people, including some of our readers, probably disagree with Blumenthal on other issues, this one is likely to ring a few bells for people who see that what he is saying holds weight. Another person shared the following which also provides potential context as to the strategic way that Kennedy might be approaching winning the presidency: I mean the guy doesn't even have secret service yet, what's he supposed to do?

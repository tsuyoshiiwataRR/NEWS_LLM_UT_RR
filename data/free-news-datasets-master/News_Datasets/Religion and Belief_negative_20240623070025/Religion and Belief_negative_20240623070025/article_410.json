    "text": "By Rob Garguilo ,\n1 hour ago Photo: Pascal Deloche / The Image Bank Unreleased / Getty Images St. Cloud, FL - A woman alleges a priest bit her arm during a communion dispute at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church in St. Cloud.\nAccording to a redacted police report, the disagreement began during Mass when the priest denied the woman communion.\nThe woman alleges she completed the necessary steps for communion, but the priest \"became upset\" and attempted to force the wafer into her mouth.\nThe report continues, stating the woman then reached for another wafer, leading to a physical struggle.\nThe woman claims the priest grabbed and bit her arm, while the priest maintains she attacked him first and wouldn't release the communion tray, prompting him to bite her arm in response.\nBody camera footage from responding officers captured a woman's claim that a priest bit her arm during a disagreement over receiving communion.\nThe priest was not arrested, but the woman has expressed her intent to pursue legal action.\nThe St. Cloud Police Department has forwarded the case to the State Attorney's Office for review, where it will be determined if charges will be filed.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

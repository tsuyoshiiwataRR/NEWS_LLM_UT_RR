The Visigoths were in power until the Islamic conquest of Spain in the 8th century.\nWhy didn’t Protestants take root in Spain?\nProtestantism did not gain significant traction in Spain mainly due to the country’s long-standing Catholic tradition and the efforts of the Spanish government to suppress Protestant influences through persecution and legal restrictions.\nWas King Philip II of Spain Protestant?\nNo, King Philip II of Spain was a staunch defender of Catholicism and considered himself the chief defender of Catholic Europe.

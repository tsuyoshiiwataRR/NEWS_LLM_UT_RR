    "text": "A South Korean entertainer, known as Monk DJ, has sparked controversy in Malaysia for his prayer-like dance moves, which are considered disrespectful to the Buddhist faith.\\nYoon Seong-ho, 47, is not a monk, but a comedian who underwent a Buddhist initiation ritual at Jogye Temple in South Korea in November last year.\\nHe was given the Dharma name “New Jin” by his master, which means “striving forward into the new”, according to the China Press.\\nHe calls himself “DJ NewJeansNim” and incorporates Buddhist elements into his electronic music, such as striking a wooden fish.\\nYoon says he aims to use his identity as a DJ to promote a better understanding of Buddhism and to challenge prejudices against it.\\n\\nIn May last year he gained fame with his song Buddha Handsome and attracted 88,400 followers on YouTube.\\nDressed in monk’s robes, Yoon appears at music festivals in South Korea and Malaysia where he mixes music and incorporates rapping and prayer gestures into his live sets.\\nOn May 3, after his performance at a club in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, Yoon faced condemnation from local politicians and the Buddhist community.\\nMalaysian lawmaker Wee Ka Siong expressed concerns that DJ NewJeansNim’s performance might misrepresent Buddhist values and teachings.\\nThe Young Buddhist Association of Malaysia received complaints from devotees, saying that his performance was offensive and disrespectful to the Buddhist way of life.\\n“He is not a real monk at all. He is just using Buddhism to gain fame for himself,” one online observer said on YouTube.\\nAs a result, other appearances scheduled for Malaysia, including those planned for May 21 in Kuala Lumpur and May 31 in Melaka, were cancelled.\\n“I’m so disappointed. I wanted some spiritual cleansing and was looking forward to seeing him,” one online observer wrote on Instagram.\\n“Do not give up, you did nothing wrong, and thanks for bringing this show to us,” another person said.\\nIn April, the largest Korean Buddhist sect, the Jogye Order, presented Yoon with a pair of DJ headphones, saying: “New Jin has played a crucial role in promoting new and youthful Buddhism to the younger generation.”\\n\\nOn May 12, Yoon told South Korean television network JTBC that his prayer-like hand movements synchronised with the music are a form of dance aimed at alleviating suffering.\\nHe also integrates Buddhist teachings into his lyrics, such as: “Everything will pass, as long as you overcome suffering, you will reach paradise.”\\nRegarding his sudden fame, Yoon said: “To be honest, I feel a significant sense of responsibility. I need to perform better and I don’t want to let people down.”\\nHe told JTBC that he has studied Chinese and plans to master English this year, which will be beneficial for his international performances.\\nOn May 17, he made his debut show in Hong Kong, performing at a nightclub in the city’s Central district. He will perform in the city again next month.\\n",

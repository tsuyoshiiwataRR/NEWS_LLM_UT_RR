    "text": "The mother of Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah has passed away on Saturday. In a statement, Hezbollah’s Media Relations announced the demise of Hajjah Om Hasan Nasrallah, calling for a popular funeral of the Hezbollah leader’s mother on Sunday. The video below shows some photos and scenes of Sayyed Nasrallah’s mother. Hezbollah offered condolences to Imam Mahdi (May Allah Hasten His Reappearance), Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, Sayyed Abdul Karim Nasrallah (father of Sayyed Nasrallah) and Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah. “On this painful occasion, we call for a funeral to be held at 14:00 (Beirut time) on Sunday at Al-Shaheedain Cemetery in Ghobeiry,” the statement read. Sayyed Hashem Safeiddine, Head of Hezbollah’s Executive Council, along with Sayyed Nasrallah’s father and brothers started to receive people offering condolences over the demise of Hajjah Om Hasan at Al-Shaheedain Cemetery in Ghobeiry in Beirut’s southern suburb (Dahiyeh). Speaker Nabih Berri and Deputy Chief of Islamic Shiite Council Sheikh Ali Al-Khatib called Sayyed Nasrallah offering condolences to the Hezbollah leader. Source: Al-Manar English Website",

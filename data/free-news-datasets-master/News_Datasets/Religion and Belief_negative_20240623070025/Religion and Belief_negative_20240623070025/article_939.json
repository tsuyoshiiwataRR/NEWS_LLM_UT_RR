    "text": "A youth leader with Destiny Church has reportedly been stood down for allegedly sexually abusing youths. Credits: Newshub\nA youth leader with Destiny Church has reportedly been stood down for allegedly sexually abusing youths in his care.\nIt's reported he had youngsters stay at his home over a number of years and now faces multiple sexual assault allegations.\nMore from Newshub\nPolice investigate confrontation after man raises pride flag outside Destiny Church\nBrian Tamaki 'suing' councils for 'rainbow-washing' The New Zealand Herald is reporting a young man's mother went to police with allegations of sexual abuse last November and after police approached the church, it stood down a youth leader and banned him from the church.\nIn a statement police confirmed an investigation is ongoing into historical sexual abuse allegations at a youth group based in Counties Manukau but given the nature of these complaints police said there's a specialised process that needs to be worked through to progress the investigation.\nPolice said they are not able to comment on a number of specifics due to the ongoing investigation and out of privacy considerations.\nDestiny Church has been a loud conservative voice in the conversation around sexuality.\nThe rainbow community criticised Destiny Church for a David v Goliath-style ad showing a boy carrying a severed head and bearing the tagline: \"Time to Kill.\"\nTamaki said the giant depicted in the advert symbolised a spirit that wanted to sexualise our children.\nMeanwhile, a relative of Tamaki last month pleaded guilty to destroying a rainbow crossing on Karangahape Road.",

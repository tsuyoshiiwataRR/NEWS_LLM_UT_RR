    "text": "GREENSBORO — A senior pastor of Friendly Avenue Baptist Church faces a federal criminal charge for allegedly falsifying records during a sexual misconduct investigation at a Texas seminary where he served as an interim provost, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Southern District of New York. The Rev. Matthew Queen, 49, of Greensboro, who was interim provost at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, in 2023, when a Department of Justice investigation began, is charged with one count of falsification of records, a crime that carries a maximum prison term of 20 years, the release said. Queen was arraigned before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, senior judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on May 21, the release said. It is unclear why the charges stemmed from the New York District. People are also reading… Queen is accused of falsifying records related to a sexual misconduct probe at the seminary, where he worked for about a decade, the release detailed. According to the Justice Department, Queen did not inform the FBI of a conspiracy to destroy evidence about the misconduct investigation, but allegedly falsified notes to provide to federal investigators. “Queen’s alleged actions deliberately violated a court order and delayed justice for the sexual abuse victims,” FBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith said in a release. Calls to the Greensboro church and to Queen were not immediately returned. Queen did provide a statement to WFMY-News2: “I was present during a conversation of interest to investigators and was interviewed about my recollection of that conversation,’’ Queen said in the statement. “Prosecutors believe I misrepresented that conversation and my notes about that conversation during my interview with them. My integrity is everything to me, and I will cling to that integrity and seek to be vindicated by God and man.’’ Information about Queen’s custody status was not immediately available. On Thursday, the seminary released a statement regarding charges against Queen: “The indictment against Matt Queen, a former seminary administrator and professor, stems from a report in November 2022 of an alleged sexual abuse committed by a Texas Baptist College student. Within hours of becoming aware of an arrest warrant for the student on Jan. 24, 2023, the seminary facilitated the arrest of the accused student, who was suspended and later withdrew from the college.’’ When seminary administrators became aware of the original report and the “later responses of certain staff,’’ the seminary notified the Justice Department, the statement said. “The seminary has and will continue to cooperate fully with the DOJ in its investigation of sexual abuse,’’ the statement said. After seminary administrators learned of Queen’s alleged actions in June 2023, he was placed on administrative leave and resigned as interim provost, the statement said. “Southwestern Seminary takes seriously its moral and legal duties to care for victims of sexual abuse. The actions alleged in the indictment are antithetical to the values of the seminary,’’ the seminary statement said. (336) 349-4331, ext. 6140 @SpearSusie_RCN",

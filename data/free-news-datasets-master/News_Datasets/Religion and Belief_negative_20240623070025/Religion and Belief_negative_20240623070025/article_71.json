    "text": "KALAMAZOO, Mich. — A damning report from Attorney General Dana Nessel's office. The 144-page report details sexual abuse allegations involving nearly two dozen priests within The Diocese of Kalamazoo. Some dating back to January of 1950. This report is only one part of a long-running investigation happening in Michigan. Kalamazoo is the third of seven clergy allegations in Michigan. The first in Marquette and the second in Gaylord. The Attorney Generals’ office has been working to pursue criminal charges against the alleged sexual misconduct of priest in the mitten since October of 2018. “The Psalms tell us that it is better to trust in the Lord than to trust in men and we see how true this is,” said Bishop Lohse. “Cases of sexual abuse and assault are thoroughly reviewed and whenever we are able to pursue criminal charges we do so relentlessly,” said Attorney General Nessel. Bishop Edward Lohse for The Diocese of Kalamazoo said the allegations are heartbreaking. “For any way in which we have failed you, the faithful who come to mass Sunday after Sunday, I am deeply sorry,” said Bishop Lohse. AG Nessels report does not criminally charge anyone with sexual assault or sexual abuse because there wasn’t enough evidence, or the statute of limitations has run out. In some cases, there simply was not enough evidence. Her report highlights her office has been and continues the investigation into years’ worth of allegations dating back over seven decades. “I wish to confirm that no priest identified in The Attorney General’s report is currently in active ministry,” said Bishop Lohse. In the report for Kalamazoo 24 adults have been accused of sexual misconduct, 19 of them were priests. “Twelve were ordained or incarnated by The Diocese of Kalamazoo. I must note that of course a criminal charge is merely an allegation and presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty,” said Attorney General Nessel. Two of the men named in the report have been charged by AG Nessels office. Father Jacob Vellian, a priest at St. John the Evengelist parish in Benton Harbor was charged in May 2019 on two counts of rape. He died in December 2022. Second is Father Brian Stanley, a priest at St. Margarets Catholic Church in Otsego. News Channel 3 was in the courtroom when Stanley was charged in 2019. “Was sentenced in January of 2020 to 60 days incarceration and 5 years’ probation on one count of attempted false imprisonment. Stanley plead guilty in January 2020 to immobilizing a teenage boy by wrapping him tightly in plastic wrap.” The report says quote, “it covered his eyes. Fr. Stanley cut holes in the cellophane for him to breathe.” “He could only mumble yes and no and shake his head because his arms were on top of his chest, and he was wrapped tightly in the cellophane.” Father Stanley left the child alone in the janitors closet for hours before letting him out back in 2013. Not only does the report talk about the allegations of sexual misconduct regarding children, it also talks about that of adults. AG Nessel credited Bishop Lohse and The Diocese of Kalamazoo for their cooperation in their years long investigation which is far from being over. “As part of my clergy abuse investigation to date my department has issued criminal charges in 11 cases and has secured convictions in 9 resulting in justice for at least 38 survivors, “said Attorney General Nessel.",

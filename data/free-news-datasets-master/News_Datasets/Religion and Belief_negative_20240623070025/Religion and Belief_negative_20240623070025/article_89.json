The host began to bleed blood in copious amounts and would not stop until he went back into the church and swallowed the host. Catholic school was pretty weird at times.\nHowever, a Eucharistic miracle more commonly reported is that of the Bleeding Host, where blood starts to trickle from a consecrated host, the bread consecrated during Mass.\nHowever, a Eucharistic miracle more commonly reported is that of the Bleeding Host, where blood starts to trickle from a consecrated host, the bread consecrated during Mass.\nOur communicant was taught the errors of his ways, and was brought back to Christ. It’s a bleedin’ miracle.\nOh, no! The Body of Christ would never cause communicants to harm themselves by causing them to accidently bite their tongues! The blood must have come from… the host! A miracle!",

    "text": "Pope Francis Lambasts the Scourge of Human Trafficking The Holy Father pointed out that trafficking is 'a ‘business’ that disrespects and disregards human dignity, delivering large profits to people without moral scruples.' Pope Francis today urged the abolition of human trafficking, “one of the most terrible scourges of our time” that disrespects and disregards human dignity and delivers “large profits to people without moral scruples.” The Holy Father denounced the practice in his message addressed to the participants of the general assembly of Talitha Kum, the organization formed by survivors actively engaged in the fight against human trafficking. For Pope Francis, trafficking is a “systemic” evil and as such “we can and must eliminate it through a systematic, multilevel approach.” “Trafficking is reinforced by wars and conflicts,” the pontiff said, “benefits from the effects of climate change and socioeconomic disparities, and takes advantage of the vulnerability of people forced to migrate or the conditions of inequality in which they find themselves, especially women and girls.” The Holy Father pointed out that trafficking is “a ‘business’ that disrespects and disregards human dignity, delivering large profits to people without moral scruples.” “Trafficking is constantly evolving and always finding new ways to develop, as it did during the pandemic,” he noted. However, the Pope urged participants “to not be discouraged” because “with the power of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and the dedication of so many, we can succeed in eliminating it.” To accomplish this, Pope Francis stressed the importance of following the steps taken by Talitha Kum: “Stand by the victims, listen to them, help them get back on their feet and together take action against trafficking.” “To be truly effective against this odious criminal phenomenon, we need to be a community,” he said. The Pope also pointed out this is not an easy task, but it can be done, and thanked the organization for its work that has become “a reference point for victims, their families, those at risk, and the most vulnerable communities.” Finally, Pope Francis encouraged Talitha Kum members to “continue on this path, furthering prevention and care, and weaving together many valuable relationships that are indispensable in order to combat and defeat trafficking.” - Keywords: ['pope francis](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/pope-francis)",

    "text": "States » NorthPosted at: May 24 2024 5:26PM Authorities prevent Mirwaiz from delivering Friday sermon at Jamia masjid : AnjumanSrinagar, May 24 (UNI) Hurriyat Conference Chairman and Kashmir’s chief cleric Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was prevented by authorities for the fourth consecutive Friday from delivering the sermon and conducting prayers at historic Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, Anjuman Auqaf Jama Masjid said. The managing body of the Jamia mosque said from May 3 Mirwaiz has been prevented from offering Friday prayers. Anjuman expressed deep regret that Mirwaiz, from May 3 and for the fourth consecutive Friday, has been prevented from performing the religious duty of delivering the Friday sermon and conducting prayers at Jamia Masjid here. It said in a statement that this attitude of the authorities deeply hurts the religious sentiments of thousands of people who come from both the city and the countryside every friday to benefit from Mirwaiz's sermons and advice. This left them to return disappointed. The statement urged the administration to lift the restrictions on Mirwaiz and allow him the freedom to propagate religious teachings and responsibilities.UNI MJR CS1725Tags: #Authorities prevent Mirwaiz from delivering Friday sermon at Jamia masjid : Anjuman",

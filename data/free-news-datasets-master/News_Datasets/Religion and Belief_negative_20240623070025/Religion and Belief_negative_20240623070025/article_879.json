    "text": "Lucknow: Hitting out at West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for her recent remarks where she claimed that some members of the Bharat Sevashram Sangh and the Ramakrishna Mission were acting at the behest of BJP, CM Yogi Adityanath accused her and other members of the INDIA bloc like Congress, SP and RJD of engaging in “anti-Hindu politics”.Speaking to the media in Gorakhpur on Saturday, the CM accused the opposition of wanting to form the govt at any cost, adding that no Indian would allow this to happen. He said that the Bharat Sevashram Sangh and Ramakrishna Mission were esteemed religious and spiritual institutions. The Ramakrishna Mission, which follows the ideals of Swami Vivekananda, is known for its commendable work in promoting the values and principles of Sanatan dharma and India’s spiritual heritage across the country and the world. It was Vivekananda, he said, who had proclaimed that ‘we should say with pride that we are Hindus’. The CM added that the Bharat Sevashram Sangh was an influential spiritual organisation, working to promote values and principles of Sanatan dharma both within India and globally.“Opposing Sanatan dharma and Hindus is the foundation of the politics of the INDIA bloc which includes Congress, SP, TMC, RJD and Aam Aadmi Party. The statements made by its leaders, including Mamata Banerjee, reflect their frustration over their impending defeat in the Lok Sabha polls,” he said. The CM said that the followers and devotees of these organisations would give a befitting reply to Congress, TMC and other INDIA bloc members. Comparing the current situation with the era of Ravana when sages were under threat, the CM said that Sanatan dharma would not be intimidated by such provocations and would respond decisively. “While the INDIA bloc parties are threatening Hindu religious and spiritual institutions, they are also undermining the rights of backward caste people. In 2010, the TMC govt in West Bengal diluted OBC reservations by including 118 Muslim castes in the OBC category, depriving millions of individuals from backward castes of reservation benefits over the past 14 years,” the CM said, demanding an apology from the TMC govt and Congress for this decision.He added that this decision was also contrary to the principles of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, who had said that reservations should not be based on religion.Saying that implementation of reservations based on religion was part of a conspiracy to divide India further, the CM praised a recent Kolkata high court order to cancel OBC certificates issued since 2010, calling it highly commendable. This ruling, he added, was a strong rebuke to the TMC, Congress and other INDIA bloc parties.",

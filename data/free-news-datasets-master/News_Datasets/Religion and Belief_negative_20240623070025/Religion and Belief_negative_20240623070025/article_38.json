    "text": "When Christian metal band Stryper rose to fame in the 1980s, the group was somewhat polarizing among Christians.\nWhile frontman Michael Sweet and his drummer brother Robert Sweet came to faith after watching TV preacher Jimmy Swaggart, Swaggart later\nreferred to Stryper and all Christian rock music as “blasphemy” and “the voice of the dragon.”\nToday, Michael Sweet still believes that the church has work to do in overcoming its judgmental posture toward the world.\n“People use the Scriptures about judging and how we’re called to judge people,” Sweet told\nCrosswalk Headlines. “And I think they misinterpret that and twist it into their own Scripture. And we’ve got to be really cautious of that.”\nRELATED:\n‘We’re Definitely Living in the End Times,’ Says Stryper Frontman Michael Sweet\n“What that means is we’re supposed to hold each other accountable, but you’re not supposed to go out with a hateful heart and in a godless spirit and judge people because all that does is turn people away from God,” he added.\nSweet fears that such an attitude among Christians is “turning other people away from God. I feel that the church does that far too often.”\nWith the advent of social media, Sweet said he routinely sees judgmental comments from Christians directed at him or other artists that he admires.\n“We live in a ‘me’ world. It’s all about self-gratification. Everyone’s giving their opinion,” he said. “We all fall prey to that. But it doesn’t make it right. And we need to all be very careful of that.”\nSweet and Stryper have always taken a different approach.\nRELATED:\n‘To Hell With the Devil’—For KING & COUNTRY Team Up With Lecrae and Stryper\n“We have unbelievers come to the show; we have believers come to the show,” Sweet said. “Our goal was always to go into the mainstream world and perform. You know—go into the bars, go into the clubs, arenas with bands like White Lion. We were never a church band. That just wasn’t our calling.”",

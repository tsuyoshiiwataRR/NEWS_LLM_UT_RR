    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Receiving backlash for a video where he recited verses from the Quran in front of the Batu Caves Hindu Temple, a tourist has now issued an apology. The tourist who goes by the handle @abdeentube apologised for his behaviour on his TikTok account. In the video, he said he received angry messages after making the video which has since been taken down. \"For me, it is strange because I thought it was a historic point (historic site) and I can recite the Quran here because it is my content. Right now I feel that it is not welcome in this place. This is a special video for the Hindus, Buddhists and any religion. \"I thought it was a historic site and anyone can make content there. It did not think it would hurt people, especially the Hindus,\" he said in the video posted on Saturday (May 25). The man who goes by Abdeen in his profile apologised if he had hurt anyone. \"It was not my intention to hurt anyone or to make people feel bad by reciting the Quran which is my content. I do this everywhere, I am spreading love,\" he said. It was reported that he uploaded a video on his TikTok account sparking a debate questioning the moral basis and the man’s intent in reciting Islamic verses in front of the Lord Murugan statue in Batu Caves. An online portal shared that Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Religious Affairs) Datuk Mohd Na’im Mokhtar condemned the tourist’s actions for reciting the Quran verses at the Batu Caves Hindu temple. Mohd Na'im deemed the behaviour of the tourist as highly inappropriate and disrespectful, presuming that the individual lacked an understanding of Malaysia's multicultural society and the sanctity of religious sites. \"The actions of this individual, who recited verses from the Quran (Surah Al-Anbiya' verses 66 and 67) at a non-Muslim place of worship, were completely unacceptable. \"He did not comprehend the situation and reality of religious harmony in Malaysia,\" Na’im told the portal. The minister warned that such provocative actions could severely undermine the peaceful coexistence of different faiths in the country. Mohd Na'im then said that Islam strictly prohibits insulting other religions, as it will only provoke retaliation and enmity. WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!",

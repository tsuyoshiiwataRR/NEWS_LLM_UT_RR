    "text": "American Bishops Hid Information about Colombian Priests Accused of Child Sex Abuse At least eight bishops in the US chose not to tell their congregations about the accusations of MORE IN THIS SECTION At least eight bishops in the US chose not to tell their congregations about the accusations of child sex abuse against eight Colombian priests who served in their jurisdictions. Joseph J. Tyson, the Bishop of Yakima, Washington, is a sports fanatic. During his sermons, he peppers his meditations on Saint Paul with references to the Super Bowl and Cooper Kupp, the Yakima-born Los Angeles Rams wide receiver. According to Tyson, to sin is \"to miss the mark\" and, even if we lose, God will inspire us. «Regardless of the team we follow, we share the same goal». Every analogy, though, reaches a breaking point. Preventing child sexual abuse is not a game, and it can't be compared to a sport. In those cases, missing the mark can be devastating. In 2016, Tyson dismissed a complaint filed against a priest in his jurisdiction and refused to speak with the alleged victim. The young man, named Jonatan Rodríguez, had sent an email to the Diocese of Yakima detailing the sexual abuse he claimed to have suffered since the age of 14 at the hands of Argemiro Orozco, a Colombian priest and the current pastor of the Holy Apostles Parish, in East Wenatchee. According to the accusation, the episodes of abuse went on for almost a decade, and took place in Colombia, during Orozco's trips to his home country. Rodríguez and Orozco had already faced each other in the past. In 2013, the priest sued the young man for attempted extortion. In a matter of days, the Police arrested Rodríguez, his parents and a family friend for accepting a cash payment of 90 million pesos (roughly 50.000 USD back then.) According to the young man, the priest had promised him the money to keep him quiet. The four of them spent eleven months in prison before a judge ruled that they were innocent. During the trial, Rodríguez made public his allegations against Orozco, but the priest denied any wrongdoing. Instead, he claimed that the two of them had engaged in an adult, consenting homosexual relationship. We reached out to Orozco for comment, but he did not reply. Eleven years since the trial, and seven since Rodríguez sent his account to Tyson, the Diocese of Yakima continues to stand by Orozco. According to Robert M. Siller, the diocese's Episcopal Vicar and Chancellor, «the bishop is morally certain that no abuse occurred». Tyson came to this conclusion after studying the case with his board of lay advisors. But neither the board nor the bishop reached out to Rodríguez, who stands by the claims he made during the trial and in the 2016 email he sent to the diocese. In his apostolic letter Vos estis lux mundi (2019), Pope Francis updated the norms and procedures of the Catholic Church in relation to cases of sexual abuse. When dealing with accusations against clergymen, the document claims that «the Church authorities must commit to treating the alleged victim and his/her family with dignity and respect; they must welcome, listen to and accompany them, including offering specific services, such as spiritual, medical and psychological assistance depending on the case». Tyson has not welcomed or offered psychological assistance to Rodríguez, who has battled against heroin addiction in Colombia and is HIV-positive. In regards to Orozco, the Diocese of Yakima has limited its reply to the following statement: «We know him well and no other complaints have been made against him during 31 years of exemplary service [...] He is in good standing in our diocese and we stand by him». Accordingly, Bishop Tyler has not included Orozco's name in the [Yakima Diocese Abuse Disclosure List](https://sites.google.com/a/yakimadiocese.com/abuse-disclosure-list/). Even though he has not interviewed the alleged victim, the prelate claims that Rodríguez's account adds up to a series of «unsubstantiated allegations». An overdue conversation Two decades after The Boston Globe published its ground-breaking investigation \"Church Allowed Abuse by Priest for Years\", journalists have yet to shine a light upon a particular side of the story: how the Church has covered up accusations against priests who have moved from one country to another. Besides Argemiro Orozco, there are at least 39 other Colombian priests accused of sexually abusing children in either Colombia or the United States. Some of them, like Orozco, were accused in the South American country after serving as priests in the States. Others were accused in Colombia, before they took off in search of the American Dream. Luis Eduardo Villada belongs to the first group. His name appears in two lawsuits filed in Colombia's Fiscalía General (the country's Attorney General's Office) in 2021; both deal with priests who allegedly abused minors. According to the leading Puerto Rican newspaper El Nuevo Día, Villada was accused of sexual aggressions in 2006 in San Juan. Nevertheless, the 2022 edition of the Archdiocese's directory introduces him without alluding to the allegations made against him in the past. Roberto González, San Juan's Archbishop, concedes that Villada is one the priests under his watch, but claims that his subordinate does not currently conduct priestly duties. In fact, the prelate is unaware of the priest’s whereabouts, despite the fact that in 2012 the Vatican found Villada guilty of \"crimes against the 6th Commandment and False Mysticism\". Archbishop González acknowledges that six complaints were lodged against the Colombian in 2011 and that they only suspended him in 2015, ten years after he arrived in Puerto Rico from the Archdiocese of Guayaquil, in Ecuador. \"Did the Archdiocese of Guayaquil provide the Archdiocese of San Juan a certificate of suitability when Father Villada was transferred?\", we asked Archbishop González. \"I think so, but I don't have proof,\" he replied. We then asked him if he had talked about the priest with bishops in Colombia or Ecuador, but he declined to answer. In 2021, Carlos Arturo Quintero, the Bishop of Armenia, Colombia, received a sexual abuse complaint against Norberto Mateus, a Colombian priest who belongs to the Archdiocese of Atlanta. Quintero claims that he notified his colleagues in the United States, but Mateus' name is not included in the Archdiocese's official document, titled Priests, Deacons, Seminarists & Religious with Credible Allegations of Sexual Abuse of Minors. We reached out to Gregory John Hartmayer, the Archbishop of Atlanta, and handed him the information we had on the case. He replied that the bishop of Armenia had not notified him of the accusations made against Mateus. When we confronted Quintero, he was not able to answer why Hartmayer had contradicted his statement. Only one registered case exists of a Colombian priest accused in his home country and later transferred to the United States: the case of Roberto Antonio Cadavid Arroyave. Between 2005 and 2012, the Archdiocese of Medellín registered several complaints against the priest for sexually abusing minors while preaching and working as the school principal in two parishes, Nuestra Señora de Chiquinquirá and Santa Ana. In February 2012, Mr. Cadavid was suspended by the Archbishop of Medellín, Ricardo Tobón. Nevertheless, in November of the same year, Mr. Tobón went ahead and recommended the same priest to serve at the Diocese of Brooklyn, without informing his counterpart, Nicholas Anthony DiMarzio, about the suspension or the allegations made against him. Mr. Cadavid was expelled from the Church in 2017, but the Archdiocese of Medellín only shared the accusations made against him with the Colombian authorities in 2019. In Medellín, at least seventy priests have been accused of abusing minors. Pain and Frustration \"The long and terrible history of clergy sexual abuse and its cover-up is still being written\", claimed SNAP, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, in September 2023. Months before, at the beginning of the Synod on Synodality, an initiative led by Pope Francis that aims to advance the reform of the Church through listening and dialogue, a host of organisations, among them SNAP, rejected the naming of Argentinian cardinal Víctor Fernández as the new head of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF), a centuries-old institution tasked with promoting the Catholic doctrine and defending the Church from heresy. Fernández has been heavily criticized for the way he handled accusations of sexual abuse against several priests when he was Bishop of La Plata, in Argentina. He himself has claimed on social media that he did not \"feel prepared nor trained for these issues,\" despite the fact that dealing with those issues is one of the main responsibilities that come with his new appointment in the DDF. Eduardo Lopez de Casas, a member of SNAP's board of directors, has paid particular attention to the accusations made against those priests in charge of providing spiritual guidance to Hispanics in the United States. He believes that the Vatican should order all dioceses to make public their lists of priests accused of sexually abusing minors. Despite the pressure excreted by SNAP and other civil authorities in the country, many American bishops continue to refuse to disclose this information. Among them is Liam Cary, the Bishop of Baker, Portland. At the turn of the century, while serving in the Diocese of Baker, José Joaquín Estrada, a member of the Congregation of Jesus and Mary (CJM), was arrested for sexually abusing a fourteen-year-old girl in Morrow County, Oregon. In 2003, the priest pled guilty and was deported to Colombia, his home country. Cary's predecessor, Robert F. Vasa, reported what happened to the CJM, but the congregation refused to expel Mr. Estrada, who is still a member and a priest. Neither Vasa nor Cary have told the public about Estrada's criminal past. Cary lied when he claimed that all he knows about the Colombian is available online. According to Lopez de Casas from SNAP, there is another issue at hand: the Catholic Church is not teaching its followers to be charitable with victims. If it were up to him, a representative from SNAP or another survivor’s organization would sit on the boards of dioceses in charge of reviewing accusations of sexual abuse; currently, victims don't have a voice in the decision-making process. Lopez de Casas is also baffled by the fact that, more than twenty years since the US began to have a public conversation about clergy abuse, it is still uncommon to find any abuse-prevention literature written in Spanish in parishes throughout the country. For him, the parishioners of the Diocese of Yakima have the right to know that their bishop, Joseph J. Tyson, hid serious accusations against Argemiro Orozco, a priest known in East Wenatchee as the \"the most Mexican of Colombians.\" Just as the faithful Catholics that belong to the Archdiocese of San Juan deserve to be informed that those at the top have buried the complaints made against Luis Eduardo Villada. The same goes for those who attend church in Atlanta, in relation to the case of Norberto Mateus. Other bishops continue to hide what they know about the accusations made against Colombian priests who served in their jurisdictions. Such is the case of Edward James Burns, the bishop of the diocese of Dallas. In 2020, a man accused Óscar Mora, a Colombian priest serving in the diocese, of sexual abuse and of being part of a group of 38 priests that forced him into prostitution during his childhood, teenage years and adulthood in the Eastern plains of Colombia. The Church suspended Mora in 2020; his story is detailed in the non-fiction book Este es el cordero de Dios (\"This is the Lamb of God\"), published by Planeta in Colombia in 2021. A similar situation unfolded with Gerald Michael Barbarito, the bishop of Palm Beach. In 2019, he was made aware of a complaint against Querubín Arango, a Colombian priest who was temporarily serving under him. A report in Colombia had made public that Arango had engaged in \"virtual interactions\" with a minor in order to abuse him. That same year, Daniel Nicholas DiNardo, the Archbishop of Galveston-Houston, suspended Jesús Suárez, a Colombian priest, after it became known that several accusations of sexual abuse were made against him while he served in the diocese of Socorro and San Gil, in Colombia. All three cases have something in common. The names of Mora, Arango and Suárez do not appear in the official list of accused clergymen of the dioceses where they served while living in the United States. \"The priest has a presumption of innocence\", said Joseph J. Tylor, the Bishop of Yakima, in relation to the case of Argemiro Orozco. But that is not the issue at hand. Rather, it is the fact that the claims made by a person in Colombia have been dismissed by the Diocese of Yakima, just as it has happened to many other alleged victims around the world. Rodríguez, in Colombia, is frustrated by the lack of cooperation on behalf of the Church: \"I feel helpless when I see these priests going about as if nothing happened, after causing so much harm. How many children have they abused in these years?\". *** These are the 40 Colombian priests who have been accused of abusing minors and who have worked in the United States. The first eight do not appear in the abuse disclosure lists of American dioceses; the remaining 32 do appear. Some have already died. We reached out to almost all of them, but not a single one replied. These are the 40 Colombian priests who have worked in the United States and are accused of abusing minors. The first 8 do not appear in the abuse disclosure lists of their respective American dioceses; the remaining 32 do. Some have already died. We emailed almost all of them, but not a single one replied. Colombian priests whose name does not appear in the abuse disclosure lists of the American dioceses where they served. 1. Argemiro Orozco Bedoya During a trial for attempted extortion from which he was later absolved, Jonatan Rodríguez Osorio claimed that Orozco Bedoya sexually abused him since his adolescence. According to the complaint, the episodes of abuse took place when Orozco travelled to the Colombian city of Pereira from the United States, where he continues to serve as a priest. 2. Luis Eduardo Villada Muñoz In 2006, according to a Puerto Rican newspaper, Villada was accused of sexual violence and suspended by the Archdiocese of San Juan. In addition, his name appears in two lawsuits filed in 2021 in Colombia's Attorney General Office, both related to priests who sexually abused minors. The 2022 edition of the Archdiocese's directory introduces him as an ordinary diocesan priest. Roberto González, San Juan's Archbishop, claims to be unaware of the priest’s whereabouts, despite the fact that in 2012 the Vatican found Villada guilty of \"crimes against the 6th Commandment and False Mysticism\". González acknowledges that six complaints were lodged against the Colombian in 2011 and that they only suspended him in 2015, ten years after he arrived in Puerto Rico from the Archdiocese of Guayaquil, in Ecuador. 3. Norberto Mateus The Diocese of Armenia, Colombia, recorded a sexual abuse complaint against Mateus in 2021 and, according to them, referred it to the Archdiocese of Atlanta, where the Colombian currently serves; Carlos Arturo Quintero, the Bishop of Armenia, also claims that they informed the authorities. But the Archbishop of Atlanta, Gregory John Hartmayer, denies that he was notified of the accusations made against Mateus. When we confronted Quintero with Hartmayer's account, he could not explain why his colleague in the United States contradicted his version of events. 4. Roberto Antonio Cadavid In 2005, the Archdiocese of Medellín registered several complaints against Cadavid for sexually abusing minors in Bello, Antioquia, where he preached and worked as the principal of a school called Nuestra Señora de Chiquinquirá. Similar complaints were made against him while he lived in Medellín, where he earned a living preaching in the Santa Ana parish and as the principal of another school, Pablo VI. In February 2012, Cadavid was suspended by the Archbishop of Medellín, Ricardo Tobón. Nevertheless, in November of that same year, Tobón recommended the priest to serve in the Diocese of Brooklyn, without informing his counterpart, Nicholas Anthony DiMarzio, about the suspension or the allegations made against him. Mr. Cadavid was dismissed from the Church in 2017, but the Archdiocese of Medellín only shared what they knew about him with the Colombian authorities in 2019. Currently, his file is in the hands of the Prosecutor's office, but no legal procedure has begun. 5. José Joaquín Estrada Arango Arango was placed under arrest while actively serving as a priest in the Diocese of Baker, in Portland, Oregon. He was taken into custody for sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl in Morrow County. He pled guilty in 2003 and was deported to Colombia. According to the Congregation of Jesus and Mary, which knew of his record, and to which he belonged, Estrada \"left the community in 2009 and is currently living with his family.\" Yet the Colombian is still a priest. The Congregation of Jesus and Mary has refused to expel him formally. 6. Óscar Yesid Mora Parrado A man accused Mora of sexual abuse and of being part of a group of 38 priests that forced him into prostitution during his childhood, teenage years and adulthood in the Eastern plains of Colombia. The Church suspended Mora in 2020, while serving in the diocese of Dallas, Texas; his story is detailed in the book Este es el cordero de Dios (\"This is the Lamb of God\"), published by Editorial Planeta in Colombia in 2021. 7. Querubín Ignacio Arango Figueroa In the secret archive of the Catholic Church in Colombia, one finds the following words: \"In 2019 we were made aware of an accusation [against Arango Figueroa] for alleged sexual abuse (during a virtual interaction) and the Apostolic Vicariate of Trinidad decided to suspend him from priestly duties, likewise the diocese of Palm Beach, where he was undergoing a pastoral experience.\" Bishop Héctor Javier Pizarro has stated that the accusation was made while Arango served in the Divina Misericordia chapel, in Orocué, Casanare. \"Internally, we were not able to demonstrate that an episode of sexual abuse actually took place\", claimed the Apostolic Vicariate, even though the victim's family sued Arango. \"Nevertheless, taking into account the statements made by the priest , the jury absolved him,\" continued the ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Despite the fact that he was found innocent, in March 2023 Arango had no role within the Church's structure nor did he conduct priestly duties. 8. Jesús Suárez The Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, in Texas, suspended Suárez in 2019 as a result of several allegations of sexual abuse made against him while he serrved as a priest in the diocese of Socorro and San Gil, in Colombia. Colombian priests whose name does appear in the abuse disclosure lists of the American dioceses where they served. 9. Alfredo Pedraza Arias In 2014, the Diocese of Rockford, Illinois, registered several complaints against Pedraza for sexually abusing minors. The priest was placed under arrest and deported to Colombia in 2018 after reaching a plea deal with American authorities. Even though his case was widely covered by US media, after his deportation he served for several years as a priest for the Archdioceses of Tunja, in Colombia, under the previous archbishop, Luis Augusto Castro, and the current one, Gabriel Ángel Villa. Pedraza was suspended from priesthood in 2022. 10. Julio César Guarín Sosa Guarín was taken into custody while serving as a visiting priest in the Diocese of Stockton, San Francisco. A civil jury absolved him in 2013. Nevertheless, the minor who accused him of sexual abuse stands by her version of events: during a visit to her house, the priest grabbed her by the arm, introduced his tongue in her mouth and bit her nose. Guarín went back to Colombia in 2014 to serve under Flavio Calle Zapata, the Archbishop of Ibagué, who at no point investigated the accusations made against him in the United States. Guarín continued to serve as a priest in Ibagué until 2022, when he was transferred to the Diocese of Líbano-Honda. José Luis Henao Cadavid, the bishop of Líbano-Honda, claims that his jurisdiction was not made aware of Guarín's criminal past. The prelate, however, acknowledges that Guarín's name appears in the secret archive of the Diocese of Líbano-Tolima. 11. Luis Henao The Catholic Church suspended Henao in 2002 after an investigation of the secret archive revealed that he had been accused of sexually abusing a minor in 1981. He was reinstated as a priest by the Diocesan Review Board of the Archdiocese of New Orleans, which was unable to substantiate the allegations. 12. Enrique Díaz Jiménez Ordained as a priest in Venezuela, Díaz Jiménez has been accused of sexual abuse in the Archdiocese of Mérida (Venezuela), the Diocese of Brooklyn (New York), the Diocese of La Guaira (Venezuela) and the Archdiocese of Bogotá (Colombia). On the 22 of January 2002, he was sentenced to 53 months and 10 days of house-arrest for sexually abusing minors in the Colombian capital. According to an investigation from The New York Times, Díaz Jiménez may have abused twenty-three children in those three countries. 13. Cristóbal de Jesús Puertas Hernández Puertas served as a priest in the Archdiocese of Newark from 2001 to 2003, and in the Archdiocese of Miami from 2003 to 2005. In 2010, the Archdiocese of Miami was informed of an accusation against the Colombian for sexually abusing a minor and the case was referred to state authorities. The Archbishop of Miami also informed the Archbishop of Villavicencio, Óscar Urbina, who nevertheless allowed Puertas to continue to serve in several chapels in the eastern plains of Colombia. In 2020, Puertas was caught up in another scandal: he appeared in the list of 38 priests related to the Archdiocese of Villavicencio who were accused of sexually abusing and forcing into prostitution a young man from the age of 14 to his early adulthood. 14. Roberto Jaramillo In 2021, the Diocese of Sacramento, in California, was made aware that one of their priests, Roberto Jaramillo, had been accused of sexually abusing a girl under 14 between 1996 and 1999. Jaramillo has also been named in two other episodes of sexual violence: the first one in 1999, when he was accused of kissing a minor, and the second one in 2020, when an adult man stated that the Colombian had sexually abused him in 2001. The Diocese of Sacramento claims that Jaramillo returned to Colombia in 2008, but the Bishop of San José del Guaviare, Nelson Jair Cardona, says that the priest did not return to his jurisdiction and that since then the priest has not been involved in priestly duties in any capacity, neither in Colombia nor abroad. Cardona also issued \"canonical precautionary measures that forbid him from undertaking any public role in priestly matters\". The Sacramento Police Department currently has an active arrest warrant against Jaramillo. 15. Luis Eugenio De Francisco The Diocese of San Diego recorded an accusation against De Francisco for sexually abusing the children of migrant workers. The Colombian priest was arrested in 1963 and that same year he returned to Colombia. His name appears in the list of priests accused of sexually abusing minors that was published by the Diocese of San Diego and the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston. 16. Jaime Marín Cardona The Catholic Church suspended Marín in 2019 after a complaint against him made its way to the Diocese of Bridgeport. In 2020, he was formally accused for sexually abusing two minors. The episodes took place in 2014 and 2016, while Marín served as the priest of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe Church in Danbury, Connecticut. The Colombian admitted to touching the groin of the children on several occasions. One of his victims claimed that the abuse began when he was only 12-years-old. The priest also admitted to touching the buttocks of another child. In 2020, he paid a bail worth 500,000 USD in order to regain his freedom. In 2022, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 years in prison with the possibility of parole. 17. Leonidas López The Diocese of Salt Lake City recorded accusations against López for sexually abusing three minors in 1984 and 1988. López was dismissed from the priesthood in 2014, after he returned to Colombia. 18. Sergio Calle Pérez Pérez was dismissed from priesthood in 2004. He was part of several parishes, like St. John Neumann (1998-1999), St. Marguerite d’Youville (1998-1999) and Prince of Peace (1999). His name is recorded in the abuse disclosure list posted by the Archdiocese of Atlanta, along other priests accused of sexually abusing minors. 19. Hernán Toro After a complaint reached the Diocese of San José, in California, Toro was accused and found guilty of sexually abusing a child in 1983. He continued to serve as a priest in the United States until 1990, when he was prohibited from undertaking further priestly duties. In 2017, Toro was incarcerated after he was charged on six counts of sexually abusing two girls between 2011 and 2016. 20. Luis Jesús Barajas Arias The accusations made against him were registered by the Diocese of Harrisburg, in Pennsylvania, where he worked with the Hispanic community. Barajas' name was included in the Grand Jury Report of Pennsylvania, which published in 2018 a list of the names of over three-hundred priests accused of pederasty in the previous seven decades. The secret archive of the Colombian Catholic Church reveals that, since 1989, there were worrying rumors of episodes of sexual abuse involving Barajas, who returned to Colombia with the financial support of the Diocese of Harrisburg. 21. Eduardo de Jesús Pérez Torres Torres served as a priest in several cities of the Diocese of Stockton: Ceres, Modesto, Oakdale, Stockton and Riverbank. Accused of sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in 1999, he was dismissed by that diocese in 2014. That year he returned to the Diocese of Palmira, in Colombia, where Bishop Eduardo de Jesús García employed him as the administrator of the San Judas Tadeo Parish and as the priest of two other parishes, Nuestra Señora de Fátima de Tenerife and Cristo Rey. In April 2023, he continued to serve as a priest for the Diocese of Palmira. According to Bishop García, the Diocese of Stockton only informed him of Pérez's criminal record in 2018, and he reacted by temporarily suspending the priest and conducting an investigation that the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith eventually archived because nobody had \"filed a complaint of abuse of minors\". The Diocese of Stockton differs: it added Pérez's name to an updated abuse disclosure list that includes clergy accused in other dioceses. 22. Jorge Antonio Vélez López Vélez pleaded guilty to sexually abusing a minor for eight years, while serving the Archdiocese of Baltimore. The minor met Vélez when she was 13 and preparing to receive the holy sacraments. The episodes of abuse began when she was 15. She became pregnant in 2010. The accusations were registered by the Archdiocese of Baltimore and by the Diocese of Alexandria, Virginia. Vélez was dismissed from priesthood in 2016. Four years later, in 2020, he was found to be guilty in a court of law. 23. José López Durango A series of accusations that made their way to the Diocese of Paterson and to the courts led to Lopez's incarceration in 2013. He had been accused of sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl in the rectory of St. Mary's Assumption Church, in Passaic. In January 2019, Orlando Antonio Corrales, the then archbishop of Santa Fe de Antioquia, Colombia, recommended López to the clergy in charge of the Diocese of Apartadó, despite the fact that he knew about the priest's criminal past. During his time at the Dioceses of Apartadó, López served as a priest in the San Francisco de Asís Parish and became an advisor to the ecclesiastical court ran by Bishop Hugo Alberto Torres. According to that diocese, the Colombian priest was \"ordered by the archbishop of Santa de Antioquia to return to that Archdiocese in March 2021\". Between January 15, 2022, and January 30, 2023, he was the priest assigned to the San Carlos Borromeo Parish, in Cañasgordas. In the first months of that year, Bishop Elkin Álvarez, at the time in charge of the Archdiocese of Santa de Antioquia, tried to hide López's criminal past from us. When we asked him specifically about López using the Colombian equivalent of a FOIA request, he admitted that the priest had served in that jurisdiction after \"purging the punishment that was imposed on him by the authorities in the United States\". 24. Jaime H. Dueñas Even though he was ordained in Colombia, Dueñas served as a priest in the Archdiocese of New York since the seventies. The NYPD arrested him on August 2nd, 2011, in the Nativity of Our Blessed Lady Parish, in the Bronx, accused of forcible touching and sexually abusing a 16-year-old female teenager. Dueñas was 87 years-old. He was found guilty and died while he was being removed from the priesthood. 25. Édgar Sepúlveda In 2010, he was placed under arrest in Raleigh for sexual crimes against a 16-year-old. Although the prosecutors dropped the charges against him, the ecclesiastical court created by the Diocese of Raleigh continued to operate. In 2020, the Ecclesiastical Tribunal of Atlanta dismissed Sepúlveda from the priesthood after it was able to confirm \" [the allegations of sexual abuse against a minor](https://archatl.com/offices/child-and-youth-protection/list/)\", according to Luis Rafael Zarama, the Colombian-born Bishop of Raleigh. 26. Fernando Cristancho The accusations made against Cristancho can be found in the Archdiocese of Baltimore, the Diocese of Salt Lake City and the federal court system. He was the priest of the Good Shepherd Parish in Fairfax County, Virginia, from 1995 to 1998, when he was transferred to a parish in Maryland after a young woman filed a complaint claiming inappropriate sexual conduct from him. In his new location, Cristancho orchestrated the in vitro fertilization of a surrogate mother and conceived triplets in 2001. The following year, the Archdiocese of Baltimore suspended him and, in 2006, American authorities found evidence that he had sexually abused at least two of his three children. In 2016, the Archdiocese registered a new accusation against the Colombian: a man claimed that Cristancho had sexually abused him since he was eleven. The priest was placed under arrest in September 2017. Among other things, he was accused of recording and possessing child pornography. In 2022, he was dismissed from the priesthood and sentenced to 22 years in a federal prison. 27. Juan Carlos Castañeda Mejía Castañeda arrived in the United States in 1999 and was taken into custody three years later, in 2002.

After serving his sentence, he was deported to Colombia. 28. Hugo Bedoya The Diocese of Brooklyn was the first to hear the accusations against Bedoya. The Colombian was one of the 24 priests sued civilly in 2003 by 27 people who claimed to be victims of child sex abuse. According to the lawsuit, Bedoya sexually abused a boy from the age of nine to the age of eleven in the temple and in the clergy house of Fourteen Holy Martyrs, a church in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Another man sued Bedoya in 2004 alleging that the Colombian had sexually abused him in the seventies. Bedoya was dismissed from the Catholic Church in 2012. 29. Gustavo de Jesús Cuello Cuello was ordained by the Diocese of Tyler, Texas, where he arrived in 1995. Two years later, in 1997, he was arrested for sexually abusing a 13-year-old girl.

He appealed the judge's ruling, and later a jury sentenced him to life in prison. He was dismissed from the priesthood in 2006. 30. Juan Carlos Durán The Diocese of Memphis, Tennessee, recorded accusations made against Durán. He had been expelled from the Franciscans for sexually abusing a boy in Bolivia, he was later accepted by the Dominicans, who knew about his past. In 2004, he was accused of sexually abusing another boy, aged 10, in 1999. The Dominicans expelled him in 2001. 31. Federico Fernández Baeza Even though the Archdiocese of San Antonio, in Texas, first registered accusations against Fernández in the 1980s, circa 2015 he was assigned to the Universidad San Buenaventura, in Cartagena, Colombia. He was expelled by his congregation in 2020 and dismissed from the priesthood in 2021. 32. Kelvin E. Iguabita Rodríguez Iguabita was placed under arrest in 2002 while serving as a priest in the Archdiocese of Boston.

Luis Ernesto Jaramillo Carvajal The accusations made against him made their way to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the Diocese of Baker, California. According to the Archdiocesan Report, he was accused of sexual abuse in 1986 and 1988; that year he moved to the Diocese of Baker. As a result of the 660-million-dollar settlement from a class-action lawsuit put forth by 580 plaintiffs, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles released the secret files of 25 priests, including Jaramillo. Later, his name was mentioned in a civil lawsuit against the Diocese of Baker in 2014. The lawsuit claimed that the Colombian priest had sexually abused a young man between 1988 and 1989 while serving as a priest in Our Lady of Angels Parish, in Hermiston, Oregon. Jaramillo served as a priest in Argentina, the Philippines and Mexico after being accused in the United States. The Capuchin Order claims that Jaramillo was transferred to Colombia in 2000, \"where he lived until his death.\" He died in 2005, with his priestly faculties intact. 34. Fernando López López López was placed under arrest while serving in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. In the year 2000, he pled guilty to repeated sexual violence against a minor while he was part of the Diocese of Tivoli, in Italy. The following year, the Diocese of San Bernardino, in California, refused him entry, but he was taken in by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. He was appointed to the Santo Tomás Apostol Parish, where a new accusation of sexual abuse surfaced in 2004. By then, the archdiocese had in its possession documents that mentioned the priest's criminal record, but it kept quiet. In 2005, López was found guilty and sentenced to 6 years and 8 months in prison. 35. Mario Arbeláez Olarte Placed under arrest in 2003 while serving as a priest in the Diocese of Salt Lake City, Arbeláez was accused of stalking minors online. In one case, he claimed to be a 20-year-old man and agreed to meet with a \"boy\", who turned out to be a Police officer. He did not contest the criminal charges in September, but he did not assist the reading of the ruling in November. His lawyer said that Olarte had returned to Colombia as part of his plea agreement. He was dismissed from the priesthood in 2006. Later, he joined the Old Anglo Catholic Movement, which is not subservient to the Vatican. At some point, Olarte served in the Diocese of Sincelejo, in Colombia, but Bishop José Crispiniano Clavijo has not clarified when. 36. Óscar A. Peláez Peláez was arrested in 2002 while serving in the Diocese of Stockton, California, for sexually abusing a child for three years. Peláez pled guilty and was sentenced to six years in prison. The diocese compensated the victim with one million dollars. 37. Efraín Rozo Rincón In 2007, Rozo was absolved by the then Archbishop of Bogotá, Pedro Rubiano Sáenz, who dismissed a video in which the priest admitted to having abused several minors, including his own nephew, in previous decades. \"During a month in 1969, Ernesto Rozo lived with me in my Santa Monica residence. During that period, I sexually abused him. He was 14 years old. I showed him the pictures of the naked men and women that I had taken in the sauna and in the pool of the university [of Loyola]. Some of them were 16 or 17. [...] Before I travelled to the United States [in 1967], I inappropriately touched the genitals of José Antonio Tavera. He was 14 when he came to me and anxiously asked me to inspect his penis. [...] Tavera was a student at the seminar and I was his spiritual guide.\" 38. Flover Antonio Osorio Herrera Osorio was dismissed from the Catholic Church in 2007 while serving as a priest in the United States. Even though he was ordained as a priest in 1985 by the then existing Diocese of Villavicencio, in 2003 he was transferred to the Diocese of Corpus Christi, Texas, which included his name in its abuse disclosure list of 2019. 39. Jesús Orlando Rengifo As a consequence of information shared by the Archdiocese of Newark, which detailed the alleged sexual abuse of a minor from 1994 to 1999, the Colombian Diocese of Pereira suspended Rengifo in 2016. Nevertheless, a year later, in December 2017, bishop Rigoberto Corredor assigned him to a parish in San José, a town in the state of Caldas. He justified the move arguing that there was \"a pastoral urgency due to the lack of priests and pastoral reasons\". On the 3rd of December, 2021, the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith dismissed Rengifo from the priesthood. By then, new accusations had made their way to the Diocese of Pereira, claiming \"alleged sexual insinuations and proposals aimed at some members of the San José Catholic community, among them children and young men.\" 40. John Jairo Vélez Vélez admitted to abusing an altar boy in the early nineties when he served as a priest in the Diocese of Monterey, California. Instead of alerting the authorities, the diocese sent the Colombian to the St Francis Retreat Center in San Juan Bautista, a common destination for priests accused of pedophilia. Later, Vélez travelled to Mexico City, where he was taken in by senior figures of his congregation, the Society of Mary (Marists). It is believed that he continued to serve as a priest for several more years. According to the Diocese of Monterey, he already died. *This feature was written with the support of a grant from the Fund for Investigative Journalism.",

She will be dearly missed by numerous relatives and friends; she always made time to lift up their hearts, showing compassion and grace.\nAnne, Gracious One, we will miss you!\nA Funeral Service will be held at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday, June 1, 2024, at Connelly-McKinley Funeral Home (10011-114 Street NW).

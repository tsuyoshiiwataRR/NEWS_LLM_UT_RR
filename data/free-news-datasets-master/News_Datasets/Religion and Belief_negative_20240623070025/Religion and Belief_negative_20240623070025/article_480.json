    "text": "After the Austin Stone Church in Austin, Texas, fired pastor Aaron Ivey on February 5, 2024, for allegedly sending 'explicit' messages to a teen and other men, his wife Jamie Ivey announced in a blog post recently that she is stepping away from public life. Jamie, who describes herself as a 'podcaster, speaker and writer,' wrote in a blog post that she is temporarily stepping away from public life. The statement released by the church mentioned that the abuse involved “predatory manipulation, sexual exploitation, and abuse of influence” with both adult males and a minor male. The statement added that since the allegations against Aaron Ivey surfaced, they have \\\"uncovered multiple similar instances with different individuals dating back to 2011 that show a very clear pattern of predatory manipulation, sexual exploitation, and abuse of influence.”In a blog post published on May 22 on her official website titled 'Important Update From Jamie' she said that she had been slowly pulling her herself away from public life after the allegations against Aaron surfaced and her was fired by the church three months ago. \\\"Over the past few weeks, I have tried to slowly begin returning to my public work commitments while continuing to heal privately, \\\" she wrote. \\\"I see now that it was too soon, and I apologize for any insensitivity, harm, or confusion this brought.\\\"Like all of you, I am profoundly grieved by Aaron's actions. The effect has been traumatic for the victims and, in a different way, myself and our family. I continue to deeply grieve all the pain he has caused so many people.\\\"As things have continued to unfold and be brought into the light, it is clear to me that I need more space and time to process. For now, I will be fully stepping away from my public life as a speaker, podcaster, and author to heal privately, listen, process, and discern the best way forward. I ask you all for grace as I attempt to navigate without a roadmap, a path that I did not choose.\\\"Musician Logan Garza alleged that he was one of the victims of sexual abuse by Aaron Ivey. Garza claimed that he was groomed from the age of 15 and sexually abused by Ivey from ages 16 to 20. The grooming involved making Garza feel special, exposing him to mature things like cigarettes and alcohol, and eventually coercing him into sexual acts.",

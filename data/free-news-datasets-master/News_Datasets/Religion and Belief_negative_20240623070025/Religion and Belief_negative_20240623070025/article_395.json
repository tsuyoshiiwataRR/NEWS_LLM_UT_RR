    "text": "( MENAFN - IANS) Stuttgart, May 24 (IANS/DPA) German authorities have detained an 18-year-old youth after he allegedly discussed carrying out a knife attack on a synagogue in the south-western German city of Heidelberg.\nThe suspect, who comes from the town of Weinheim, is being held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, public prosecutors and criminal investigators in the south-western German state of Baden-Württemberg announced on Friday.\nHe allegedly plotted the potential attack with another 24-year-old suspect, who was shot and captured by the police earlier this month after a raid on the man's flat turned violent.\n\"The killing of one or more visitors during the attack on the synagogue with a subsequent martyr's death was discussed as the intended goal, in which both people wanted to be shot by emergency services,\" the authorities said.\nOn May 3, police raided the home of the 24-year-old suspect in the town of Bad Friedrichshall on suspicion of preparing a serious act of violence endangering the state.\nAccording to police, the 24-year-old suddenly took several kitchen knives and fled outside through a window while officers were in his flat.\nHe was caught by officers but, instead of surrendering, he threw a knife toward a policeman and charged. The officer shot the man.\nThe 24-year-old man was treated for his injuries and remains in police custody on allegations of attempted manslaughter and a particularly serious case of assault on police officers.\nAn analysis of evidence seized during the search revealed a link to the 18-year-old man from Weinheim, with whom the 24-year-old is said to have discussed a possible knife attack on visitors to a synagogue in Heidelberg in April 2024, according to investigators.\nThe 18-year-old's apartment was searched on May 18. He was arrested and remains in custody.\nAuthorities said that there are no indications of an imminent threat to visitors to the synagogue.\nMENAFN24052024000231011071ID1108254065\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

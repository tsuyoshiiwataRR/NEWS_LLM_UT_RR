    "text": "- By [Srishti Pandey](/authors/srishti-pandey) - Published: Sun, 26 May 2024 01:09 AM (IST) - Source:JND Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the renowned Bollywood director known for his visually stunning and emotionally rich films, recently addressed his reputation for being a strict taskmaster on set. In a recent interview, Bhansali defended his occasional temper outbursts, emphasizing his commitment to his craft and the high standards he sets for himself and his team.

Despite his occasional outbursts, Bhansali emphasized that he deeply cares for his actors and technicians, often pampering them and creating a bond that makes them want to work with him again.

The series features a star-studded cast, including Manisha Koirala, Sonakshi Sinha, Aditi Rao Hydari, Richa Chadha, Sanjeeda Sheikh, and Sharmin Segal.

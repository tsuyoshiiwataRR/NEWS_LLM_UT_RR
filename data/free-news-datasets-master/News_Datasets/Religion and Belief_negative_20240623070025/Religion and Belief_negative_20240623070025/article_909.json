    "text": "Barometer\nMay 26, 2024\nA little over one year after the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) unwisely and combatively plunged into Nigeria’s presidential election fray, and got their fingers badly burnt, the Edo State chapter of the two leading Christian bodies in the country, CAN and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), have remorselessly pledged to reenact the rashness. Responding to the campaign overtures of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the September governorship election, both the PFN and CAN have promised to vote the state’s ruling party candidate Asue Ighodalo as governor. He is an example of a good Christian, they chorused. And the other also Christian candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Benson Idahosa? Well, he is either stingy, a liar or an untrustworthy man used by the devil.\nThe Ighodalo endorsement, which took place at the PFN’s 2024 Edo State School of Ministry at the PCU-PFN administrative headquarters along Benin-Auchi Road, was hearty and total. In what seemed like an annual general meeting, the Edo State chairman of the PFN, Pastor Dr. (Mrs) M.O. Agbonifo, enthused over the candidacy of Mr Ighodalo and his running mate, and averred that the Christian body had no iota of doubt that the two gentlemen were what the state needed at the Government House. And seeming to second the motion, the State CAN Chairman, Apostle Irekpono Omoike, then formally voiced the endorsement and anchored prayers for the victory of the PDP candidates at the election. Still flush with excitement, probably at the coup they had pulled off in their one-sided endorsement, Mrs Agbonifo sarcastically dismissed the APC candidate for pledging what he could not deliver. Seizing the opportunity of that corrosive statement by the PFN leader, Governor Godwin Obaseki’s wife, Betsy, who was at the event, donated a coaster bus to the Christian body in a mockery of Mr Idahosa’s failed promise. According to her, no one should trust a man who could not redeem his pledge to God.\nThe Edo PCU-PFN programme, like many contemporary religious programmes in Nigeria, easily transformed into an auctioning event, indicating that conscience can be bought and sold unabashedly. Sensing the impact of the materialistic drift of the pastors, and caught up in the frenzy, Candidate Ighodalo himself pledged a 100KVA generator to power the administrative centre of the Christian organisation. Impressed, younger brother of the candidate, Ituah Ighodalo, pastor of the Trinity House Church, also pledged N5 million to fuel the generator when it is bought. It is striking, if not demeaning to the church, that while Candidate Ighodalo and his brother Ituah were hedging their bets, the PCU-PFN took the entire body of Christ in Edo State and pledged it to a materialist and secular cause, with the Trinity House Church pastor even likening the September governorship contest to a battle between light and darkness. Of course, the PDP candidate was the light and the APC candidate anybody’s guess.\nThe shameful politicking that unnerved the church in the 2023 presidential poll has obviously continued apace. They have learnt nothing, and forgotten nothing. In last year’s election, the church seized upon the APC’s Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket as an alibi for their troubled conscience to throw caution to the wind and eagerly, uncharacteristically, and unwisely immersed itself in politics, sadly fighting one another. In Edo’s September governorship poll, both leading candidates, not to talk of that of the Labour Party (LP), are Christians. But having swallowed the hook, PCU-PFN sees no handicap in swallowing the line and sinker by persisting in politicking, preferring one Christian over another. Once a demon gains a foothold, it beckons on a legion. The fear of Islamisation, with which many churches spooked voters last year, turned out to be a bogeyman. But there were no apologies for desecrating the church, for cursing fellow Christians who showed a different preference, and for finally and shamefacedly realising that the APC ticket had in 2023 turned out to be more secular than the theocratic tickets of LP and the PDP.\nClearly, today, as the Edo election is finally illustrating, today’s Christian leaders are less inclined to evangelising and showing the light, and manifesting temperance and love: they are politicians who have brought the world into the church. It was remarkable at the PCU-PFN event in Edo that Mrs Obaseki even declared tongue-in-cheek that the inability of the APC candidate to redeem his pledge was a sacrilege. What is more, the PDP candidate was emphatic in declaring that should he win, he would remake the state along the vision of his Christian backers. Said he: “Permit me to express my profound gratitude to this august body of Christ. I am really humbled by the trust and confidence reposed in me. And I promise you, I won’t disappoint you or let you down. I wish to say this, too, that Edo State, like some other states, should have an Ecumenical Centre as a further step to fostering unity within the Christian faith in Edo State and we will ensure everybody has the freedom to practice and observe his faith without let or hindrance. More also, we will institute an Edo Thanksgiving Day, a day set aside in the year to thank God for everything.”\nGradually, the religious ossification many observers ascribe to the North is percolating into the South. It may be irreversible, especially in light of some of the bewildering judgements coming out of the courts from jurists tainted by religious prejudices, and the reluctance of the federal government to tackle hate crimes and religious intolerance propagated in Ilorin and other places against traditional religion worshippers. The church, it was initially believed, would help shine the light to defeat the gross darkness overtaking the country. Instead, it has capitulated; and some Edo politicians and church leaders are proud to be numbered among the ‘heathen’. Will the PCU-PFN endorsement make a difference in Edo? It is unlikely; other factors will probably determine the outcome of the vote in September. But whether the church wins or loses in Edo, few people will forget the inglorious and unscriptural agenda they are pursuing, an agenda angry Pastor Ituah himself did so much to foster in Lagos during the last poll.",

    "text": "Pope Francis’ recent comments that people are “fundamentally good” have drawn criticism from some Protestants, including Southern Baptist Theological Seminary President Dr. Albert Mohler, who called the pope’s remarks “Christless” and said that they were totally opposed to the teachings of Scripture.\n“When you look at the world, what gives you hope?” CBS Evening News anchor and managing editor Norah O’Donnell asked Pope Francis in a wide-ranging\ninterview that aired Sunday evening.\n“Everything,” he replied. “You see tragedies, but you also see so many beautiful things. You see heroic mothers, heroic men, men who have hopes and dreams. Women who look to the future. That gives me a lot of hope.”\n“People want to live. People forge ahead, and people are fundamentally good,” Francis continued. “We are all fundamentally good. Yes, there are some rogues and sinners, but the heart itself is good.”\n“We are all fundamentally good. Yes, there are some rogues and sinners, but the heart itself is good,” says Pope Francis.\n [pic.twitter.com/7Be2GrKrdB]\n— 60 Minutes (@60Minutes)\n[May 19, 2024]\nAlbert Mohler Critiques Pope Francis’ Comments\nIn the first extended interview Pope Francis has given an American broadcast network, he discussed the wars in\nGaza and Ukraine, immigration, climate change, surrogacy, the role of women in the Catholic church, and his decision to allow the blessing of same-sex couples.\nIt was Francis’ remarks on human nature, however, that have drawn much of the attention of Protestant Christians. Dr. Albert Mohler, who has\ncriticized Francis before, gave a blistering response to the interview in his edition of “ The Briefing” that was published Tuesday, May 21.\nRELATED:\nAlbert Mohler Says the Pope Is Ignoring ‘The Words of Jesus’ in Comments on Hell\n“Quite frankly, I think for some evangelical Protestants, it was the first real introduction to the absolute theological vacuum that is represented by the current incumbent of the\nVatican, the current pope of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis,” Mohler said.\nMohler said the pope was holding an “unbiblical office” and that Francis’ views are not even compatible with those of Roman Catholicism. “Pope Francis represents the absolute worst of theological irresponsibility,” he said.\nThe seminary president took issue with remarks Pope Francis made in the middle of the interview, when O’Donnell said, “That’s why so many people found hope with you, because you’ve been more open and accepting perhaps than other previous leaders of the church.”\n“You have to be open to everything. You have to. Everyone, everyone, everyone. That so-and-so is a sinner. Me too. I am a sinner,” the pope replied.\n“Everyone. [Even] someone with a diverse sexual gender, everyone. Everyone in. Everyone,” he emphasized. “Once inside, we’ll figure out how to sort it all out. But everyone. Do not forget that. The gospel is for everyone.”",

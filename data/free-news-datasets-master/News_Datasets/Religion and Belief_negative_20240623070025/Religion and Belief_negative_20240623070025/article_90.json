    "text": "Canada's special envoy for combating antisemitism says she is interested in exploring the idea of overriding religious rights when they are used as a defence for hate speech, drawing concern about the prospect of a chill on religious expression in Canada. Deborah Lyons made the comment before a parliamentary committee that is studying antisemitism on university campuses, saying she views it as an option because religious freedoms being used as a defence of hate speech is being seen in this country and in others. Lyons says she is still not ready to offer a final opinion on the matter and is discussing it with Justice Department officials. Jewish leaders, students and faculty have for months been voicing concerns over an increase in hate speech and violence since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war last fall. Justice Minister Arif Virani has already expressed an interest in seeking to increase the punishments for existing hate-related offences, including increasing the maximum consequence for advocating genocide to life imprisonment.

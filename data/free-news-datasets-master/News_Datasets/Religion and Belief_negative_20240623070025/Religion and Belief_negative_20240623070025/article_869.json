    "text": "I want the Benedictine Sisters of Mount St. Scholastica to have a significant voice in setting policy for the American Catholic Church. Unlike the Church’s current all-male senior management, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, these women have embraced The Compassion of the Christ — and rejected fundamentalist fanaticism. And in taking on a smug bastard, they have shown how Catholicism can elevate, not denigrate. On May 11, Harrison Butker gave the 2024 commencement address at Benedictine College. This self-important man took it upon himself to speak for America’s 80+ million Catholics — without asking their permission. This egotistical behavior by narrow-minded people is typical. It is often those who know little who think they know best. Butker ripped into Joe Biden, LGBTQ, contraception, choice, IVF, Jews, the media, and Catholic prelates he thought insufficiently dogmatic. But it was his patronizing belief that women should shun careers, stay home, cook, procreate, and raise children that proved most toxic to many — including devout Catholic nuns. As reactions to his views poured in, a thoughtful man might have considered the impact of his words. But Butker is a true believer. And like all zealots, he lacks the empathy to see the other person’s point of view. On Friday evening, in his first public remarks after his controversial speech, he treated criticism of his sexism as proof of his moral rectitude. And he doubled down on his misogyny et al. As the Independent newspaper reported it: The Kansas City Chiefs kicker attended a gala in Nashville, Tennessee on Friday May 24, presented by a Catholic homeschool organization, the Regina Caeli Academy, where he is a board member. While there, Butker gave a speech where he touched on the aftermath of his headline-grabbing speech. “The theme for tonight’s gala, Courage Under Fire, was decided many months ago, but it now feels providential that this would be the theme after what we have all witnessed these last two weeks,” Butker said. “If it wasn’t clear that the timeless Catholic values are hated by many, it is now.” The Kansas City Chiefs kicker attended a gala in Nashville, Tennessee on Friday May 24, presented by a Catholic homeschool organization, the Regina Caeli Academy, where he is a board member. While there, Butker gave a speech where he touched on the aftermath of his headline-grabbing speech. “The theme for tonight’s gala, Courage Under Fire, was decided many months ago, but it now feels providential that this would be the theme after what we have all witnessed these last two weeks,” Butker said. “If it wasn’t clear that the timeless Catholic values are hated by many, it is now.” Butker did not mention that one group who “hated” his version of “timeless Catholic values” were women who have dedicated their lives to timeless Catholic values — American nuns. The order of nuns that founded Benedictine College, the sisters of Mount St. Scholastica, offered their thoughts on Butker’s speech. They slammed the sanctimonious git in a public statement for his comments about gender roles. The nuns started by telling Butker his views on Catholic values are his and not those of the Church as a whole — or even of the school where he spoke. “The sisters of Mount St. Scholastica do not believe that Harrison Butker’s comments in his 2024 Benedictine College commencement address represent the Catholic, Benedictine, liberal arts college that our founders envisioned and in which we have been so invested.” “The sisters of Mount St. Scholastica do not believe that Harrison Butker’s comments in his 2024 Benedictine College commencement address represent the Catholic, Benedictine, liberal arts college that our founders envisioned and in which we have been so invested.” The difference between Butker and the nuns is not just in substance — but in tone. He is a smug absolutist who says he speaks for Catholics. The nuns claim nothing more than “we do not believe.” It is an exercise in arrogance vs humility. And humility is the Christian virtue. The nuns continue by condemning another one of Butker’s sins — divisiveness. “Instead of promoting unity in our church, our nation, and the world, his comments seem to have fostered division.” “Instead of promoting unity in our church, our nation, and the world, his comments seem to have fostered division.” The nuns continue in their humbleness. They leave absolute certainty for their God and reflect their modesty in words like “seem to.” It is a self-effacing diffidence a martinet like Butker would not understand. The nuns then address Butker’s sexism directly. “One of our concerns was the assertion that being a homemaker is the highest calling for a woman. We sisters have dedicated our lives to God and God’s people, including the many women whom we have taught and influenced during the past 160 years. These women have made a tremendous difference in the world in their roles as wives and mothers and through their God-given gifts in leadership, scholarship, and their careers. “One of our concerns was the assertion that being a homemaker is the highest calling for a woman. We sisters have dedicated our lives to God and God’s people, including the many women whom we have taught and influenced during the past 160 years. These women have made a tremendous difference in the world in their roles as wives and mothers and through their God-given gifts in leadership, scholarship, and their careers. These women picked their careers. And they believe every woman should have the same right to choose how to lead her life. If God gives a woman the gift to be a CEO, a marine, a lawyer, a physicist (as Butker’s mother is), or a deep-sea diver, then it is her divine right to pursue that career. If a couple decides that one should work outside the house and the other inside the home, we should all honor that decision — regardless of whether it is the woman or the man working outside. Alternatively, the couple could be two women. And in that case, unless one is a trust-fund baby, at least one of them will have to do something to earn money. As would a single mother. The nuns could have added that Butker, who at 28 has already earned over $21 million, is in a financial position to support a non-wage-earning spouse. Millions of Americans do not have that luxury. The nuns continue by pointing out that both young women and young men — no sexism in their philosophy — have learned to prepare a good Christian ‘home’ no matter where their career takes them. “Our community has taught young women and men not just how to be “homemakers” in a limited sense, but rather how to make a Gospel-centered, compassionate home within themselves where they can welcome others as Christ, empowering them to be the best versions of themselves.” “Our community has taught young women and men not just how to be “homemakers” in a limited sense, but rather how to make a Gospel-centered, compassionate home within themselves where they can welcome others as Christ, empowering them to be the best versions of themselves.” Butker will have to grow up to discover that “compassionate home within\" himself. The nuns then give Butker a metaphorical ruler rap on the knuckles for failing to keep up with the Catholic Church’s evolution. “We reject a narrow definition of what it means to be Catholic. We are faithful members of the Catholic Church who embrace and promote the values of the Gospel, St. Benedict, and Vatican II and the teachings of Pope Francis.” “We reject a narrow definition of what it means to be Catholic. We are faithful members of the Catholic Church who embrace and promote the values of the Gospel, St. Benedict, and Vatican II and the teachings of Pope Francis.” As already mentioned, Butker has the arrogance to think he speaks for the Church. The nuns — and notice their language is picking up an edge, “we reject” — point out that the Church speaks for the Church. It is not the job of someone who kicks a ball for a living. The nuns then get to a core value of Christianity — being decent to your neighbors. Their message to Butker is unstated but still evident. “Stop being an asshole.” “We want to be known as an inclusive, welcoming community, embracing Benedictine values that have endured for more than 1500 years and have spread through every continent and nation. We believe those values are the core of Benedictine College.” “We want to be known as an inclusive, welcoming community, embracing Benedictine values that have endured for more than 1500 years and have spread through every continent and nation. We believe those values are the core of Benedictine College.” The subtext is that they speak with institutional knowledge gained over time and distance. While the callow Harrison is spouting hate based on nothing but his prejudice. The nuns end with thanks to people who share their values of inclusion, encouragement, and consideration. “We thank all who are supportive of our Mount community and the values we hold. With St. Benedict, we pray, “Let us prefer nothing whatever to Christ, and may he lead us all together to life everlasting.” “We thank all who are supportive of our Mount community and the values we hold. With St. Benedict, we pray, “Let us prefer nothing whatever to Christ, and may he lead us all together to life everlasting.” Good for them. Not that Butker will care. He has already fired his fundamentalist hate at priests he considers not sadistic enough. Now, he will no doubt rip these Benedictine Sisters as women who do not know their place in his Catholic hellhole.",

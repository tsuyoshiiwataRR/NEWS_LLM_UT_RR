    "text": "It is with deep sorrow and much love that we mourn the passing of Allan Stern. At the accomplished age of ninety years, Allan passed away peacefully Sunday May 12, 2024, at the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary, Alberta. Growing up on a family farmstead, Allans childhood was occupied with farm tasks and music. Having a music teacher as a mother, each family member had at least one musical vocation and Allans preferred instrument was the saxophone. The love of Allans life was his wife, Donelda (Nunweiller) Stern. Outside of Beiseker, Alberta, they began creating a home with two children, and following the family tradition of farming, and ranching. Allan adored his family and loved gathering together for dinners and visits with his children and their spouses. He was immensely proud of his only grandson, Bradley Stern, who he cherished and conveyed a special bond with throughout his life. We will miss Allans wonderful wit and sense of humour and his love of people, animals, and nature. Allan is survived by his children, daughter Catherine (Stern) Cipriano and husband Marcelino Cipriano, son Clinton Stern, and wife Lori Stern, and grandson Bradley Stern. Additionally, Allan is survived by his siblings, Marilyn (husband Don), Yvonne, and Rhoda plus numerous nephews and nieces. He is predeceased by his wife Donelda, parents Henry and Alice, sister Noreen and twin brother Alois. We would like to thank the staff at Newport Harbour Care Centre in Calgary, for taking exceptional attention of Allan over the years and Unit 72 at the Foothills Medical Centre for the short term, before his passing. A private family gathering will be held to celebrate Allans life. Expressions of sympathy may be forwarded to the family via the website\nwww.fostersgardenchapel.ca.\nPublished online May 25, 2024 in The Calgary Sun\nIn Memory of AllanWhen is the\n[ordering deadline?](javascript:void(0))\nIn Memory of AllanHow does\n[it work?](javascript:void(0))\nSend Flowers: When Is the Ordering Deadline?\nANY DAY OF THE WEEK\nOrder any time up till the day before\nMON-FRI Order by 2:00PM\nSAT & SUN Order by noon\nTUES-SAT\nOrder by 3:00PM\nThe day before\nSAT & SUN Order by Saturday\nNote: These are general guidelines; some florists may not be able to operate within these timelines.

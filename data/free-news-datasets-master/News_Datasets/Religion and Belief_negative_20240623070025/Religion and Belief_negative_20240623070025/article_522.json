    "text": "Why is B.C. still persecuting Christian churches for worshipping during COVID lockdowns?\nDrea Humphrey interviews B.C. MLA Michael de Jong, who recently questioned the NDP government on why it's still prosecuting churches that safely opened during biased COVID restrictions instead of reconciling with them.\nFor over three years, the province of British Columbia has engaged in a legal battle with three Fraser Valley churches who served their community with in-person worship, despite COVID\npublic health orders that forbid them from doing so.\nDespite pubs, fitness classes and even indoor theme parks receiving accommodations to remain open during the declared COVID-19 pandemic, Abbotsford’s\nImmanuel Covenant Reformed Church, Langley’s Riverside Calvary Chapel and Chilliwack’s Free Reformed Church, were collectively slapped with over 40 fines, each costing $2,300, for practicing their religion.\n“Isn’t it time that the government tried to reconcile with the law-abiding and yes, by definition, God-fearing folks who drew on their faith during a very difficult time and couldn’t understand why they could go to a Pilates class but couldn’t go to church,” MLA\nMike de Jong, asked of the governing NDP during question period in the legislature last week.\nWhy is the B.C. NDP government soft on prolific offenders yet still prosecuting churches because they opened their doors for worship during selective COVID lockdowns?— Drea Humphrey - Prepping and Politics (@DreaHumphrey)\nB.C. United MLA Michael de Jong asked just that during yesterday’s Q & A period.\n [pic.twitter.com/snpV8gZS8k] [May 15, 2024]\nWhile NDP\nAttorney General Niki Sharma declined to comment on the matter, the reality Premier David Eby's government is still hammering down on the churches. Next month, 12 days of proceedings are set aside in provincial court for an abuse of process application the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms filed on behalf of the churches in response the ongoing prosecution.\nIn today’s report, I sit down and interview de Jong, who, while serving as a member of the legislative assembly with the B.C. United, was one of the very few politicians to speak out about the biased restrictions on Christian places of worship during mass COVID hysteria.\nDon't Get Censored\nBig Tech is censoring us.

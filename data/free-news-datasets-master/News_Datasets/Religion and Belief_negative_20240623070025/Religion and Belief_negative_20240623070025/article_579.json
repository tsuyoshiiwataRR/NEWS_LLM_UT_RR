    "text": "So-called Christian Nationalism doesn’t have anything to do with the teachings of Jesus that are recorded in the New Testament. At least that is what is revealed in a statement that a Christian Nationalist preacher dared to post on X.com.\nPerhaps you shouldn’t be eating or drinking anything when you read just what that preacher posted. Your gag reflex might be activated. In this particular case, the preacher’s post illustrates that the “X” in “X.com” may be an abbreviation for “Xcrement”.\nBefore presenting the Xcrement itself, one needs to know the conversation that the Xcrement is a response to.\nIt begins with a post by Wade Stotts, the narrator of the\naudio version of the book The Case for Christian Nationalism.\nInto the conversation steps Joel Berry, the managing editor of the Babylon Bee. Here is an example of Joel’s thinking:\nNow, here is Joel’s response to Wade:\nOkay, you were given opportunity to swallow anything that was in your mouth. Here is the Christian Nationalist response to Joel posted by preacher Brian Sauvé:\nYou were forewarned. So, if you had something in your mouth when you read Brian’s explanation of Christian Nationalism, then it is clean up on aisle you.*\nAs disgusting as Brian’s response is, at least he was bold enough to give it. Here is how another person responded to Joel:\nThe expression “clean up on aisle you” is from the\npilot episode of the animated series The Amazing Digital Circus.\nThe “Wanted” posters say the following about David: “Wanted: A refugee from planet Melmac masquerading as a human. Loves cats. If seen, contact the Alien Task Force.”",

Ben Baker, said in a Facebook\npost. “They went to Heaven together.”\nThe Lloyds were married in 2022, according to Baker’s social media, and worked for Missions in Haiti, Inc., which has been operated by Davy Lloyd’s parents for more than two decades, according to\nthe group’s website.\n“This evening when Davy, Natalie and the kids were coming out of Youth at the church they were ambushed by a gang of 3 trucks full of guys,” the organization\nposted to their Facebook page Thursday. “Davy was taken to the house tied up and beat. The gang then took our trucks and loaded everything up they wanted and left.”\nThree hours later, Missions in Haiti\nhttps://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02218h8LjvQHDwg7CpxSUqrnvGSUBMx33YLcCWbtPQH8V1NcHfFdj2TxB7Gf7rbunvl&id=100064274396167 that Davy and Natalie “were shot and killed by the gang about 9 o’clock this evening. We all are devastated.”\n“Please pray for my family we desperately need strength. And please pray for the Lloyd family as well,” Baker said on social media early Friday. “I have no other words for now.”\nMissouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson\nmourned the couple’s loss on X Friday morning, calling it “absolutely heartbreaking news.”\nCNN has contacted Haitian officials and Missions in Haiti for more information, and has reached out to the White House and US State Department for comment.\nThe Facebook feed of Missions in Haiti has told the story of the increasing dire conditions in the country this year. “The gangs are still fighting for more control and chaos rules,” the organization\nhttps://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02R6hpcGKVnTw8tnsuyduj3cZfEWVmnTKnTtmJF5U8MtsDuSEfK7FmKrGGcx2fNp6Jl&id=100064274396167 April 23. “It seems the world has turned their backs on Haiti and it is going to be left in complete gang control.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

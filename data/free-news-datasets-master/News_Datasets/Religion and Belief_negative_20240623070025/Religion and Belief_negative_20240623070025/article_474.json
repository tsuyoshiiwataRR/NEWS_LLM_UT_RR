    "text": "Per Kevin Drum: Zionism was solely a movement of the first half of the 20th century. In 1948, when the UN created Israel, Zionism won—and thereby wrote itself out of existence. There is now nothing more to Zionism than the belief that Israel was legitimately created and has a right to exist. Arabs initially refused to accept this and declared war on Israel, but they lost in 1949 and that was that—or should have been…. Zionism was solely a movement of the first half of the 20th century.

There is now nothing more to Zionism than the belief that Israel was legitimately created and has a right to exist. Arabs initially refused to accept this and declared war on Israel, but they lost in 1949 and that was that—or should have been…. I don't think Zionism was solely a movement in the first half of the 20th century which ended with the creation of the State of Israel because 1) Israel was created the Jewish state, and 2) being the Jewish state determined a lot of Israel’s polices well into the 1990s, regarding immigration, and the legal rights of Palestinians within and without Israel. I don’t think Israel needs to be ‘the Jewish state” — but that is something Israelis and Palestinians must work out. Even the PLO finally accepted this in the '90s. Ditto for Jordan and Egypt. On the other hand, Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, a bunch of dead-ender Arab states—and, apparently, a lot of US college students—still don't accept Israel's right to exist. It's kind of ridiculous..

Well, it’s not ridiculous if your goal is liberate Palestine from the river to the sea. But, since that goal has proven been entirely unattainable, ideologically reactionary, and demonstrably counter to Palestinian rights, well, yeah, it is ridiculous. The short version of all this is that the question \"Are you a Zionist\" is no more sensible than \"Do you support independence for the United States?\"¹ It's a question that made sense once upon a time, but no longer. All that's left is whether you refuse to accept something that even the PLO has accepted for more than three decades.

As Matt Yglesias wrote in his piece yesterday (which I recommend) that prompted Drum’s post: I think there’s something fundamentally odd about Zionism as an ethos among residents of the diaspora in the 21st century. Nothing is stopping us from moving to Israel. If you choose not to, then whatever you may say, that lack of action indicates something about your actual feelings. I did not feel — and have never felt — any desire to move to Israel or that it would be a good idea for American Jews to move en masse to Israel. My ancestors are from Eastern Europe, not Israel. My family’s culinary traditions are not Israeli. And I have no particular desire to shed my Jewish American identity in favor of an Israeli identity.

Here’s something I wrote here a while back: Zionism is primarily an historical phenomena related to the creation of a Jewish Homeland in the historical land of Jewish people AND the gathering of Diaspora Jews to that state. Zionism, as a historical event, lasted from the late 1800s to the the late 1900s. In this way, Zionism or not Zionism is kind of a dead letter. Israel is a thing, doing quite well in fact... I do not call myself a Zionist. I used to for a time. I lived in Israel and considered making Aliyah... I came to the following conclusion as a young man: I am an American Jew. America is a secular, pluralistic, multi-cultural democratic society... America is my home. America is “the Promised Land”. For me to be a Zionist would mean to make aliyah. As one kibbutznik put it to me, “We don’t need your support, your money or your bones; we need you.” That was in 1988, before the great Russian influx and many US jews would ship their bones to be interned in Eretz Israel. That was then, and I haven’t really changed my view all that much. Zionism, schmimonism. Israel exists; Zionism was a success, and arguing about Israel’s rights, or Palestinian rights is oh-just-so-much nonsense. I don’t care about any of that. I care about practical solutions to difficult problems. Like how to deal with living next to and amongst the zealots, like Hamas.

I care about practical solutions to difficult problems. Like how to deal with living next to and amongst the zealots, like Hamas. How does any of this matter? Here’s how: It seems very clear to me that Israel should have stopped its war on Gaza last year. At this point, regarding I/P, stopping that war is the only thing that matters to me. Once that is accomplished, the only thing I’ll care about is getting the resources needed to help the people of Gaza rebuild their shattered lives. If Hamas wants to be part of that process, fine. If Netanyahu wants to be part of that process, fine. If not, fine.",

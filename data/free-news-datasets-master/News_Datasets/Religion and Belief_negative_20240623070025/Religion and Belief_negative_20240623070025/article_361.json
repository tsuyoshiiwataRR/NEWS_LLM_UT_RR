    "text": "Hajj 2024: Saudi Arabia's government banned visit visa holders and tourists from performing the Hajj pilgrimage and entering Makkah from May 23 to June 21. To be allowed to perform the pilgrimage, a person must get a Saudi Hajj visa or obtain a Hajj permit.\\\"Visit visas of all types and names do not entitle their holder to perform Hajj, and instructions require obtaining a permit for that,\\\" Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Interior informed in a post on X.This means visit visas do not grant permission to perform Hajj. \\\"Temporary visas, such as student visas or Schengen visas, are not accepted,\\\" informed the website of Nusuk Hajj, a platform overseen by the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah.\\\"Visitors have been urged not to visit the city during this period [from Thursday, May 23 to Friday, June 21] or stay there without a Hajj permit during this time. Those who violate this will have strict action taken against them,\\\" the Khaleej Times reported.ALSO READ: First Haj flight departs from Delhi airport with 285 pilgrims onboard; all you need to knowOnly a Hajj permit allows a person to perform the Hajj in the Holy City of Makkah. During this time, any other form of visit visa is not considered a permit.Earlier, pilgrims were also advised to always carry their identification cards throughout the 'Hajj period'.ALSO READ: SpiceJet secures Haj flight rights from these seven Indian citiesWhat if the rule is violated?Saudi Arabia warned that defying Hajj regulations will result in severe and unwavering penalties.\\\"A fine of SR10,000 ($2,666) will be imposed on individuals caught in Makkah and the holy sites without a Haj permit, applicable to citizens, residents, and visitors,\\\" the ministry said in a statement posted on X earlier this week.It added, \\\"The fine will double for repeat offenders, and resident violators face deportation and a ban from entering Saudi Arabia,‚Äù the ministry said in the statement.",

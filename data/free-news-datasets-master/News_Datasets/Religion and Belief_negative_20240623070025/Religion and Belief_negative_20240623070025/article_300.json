PAY ATTENTION: Have Some Fun! Try Our Newest Quizzes and Polls ! When the man of God unwrapped it, he revealed a pack of condoms, a box of tampons and a jar of petroleum jelly. The act, which was captured and widely shared on TikTok , sparked a heated debate among netizens. Many condemned the gesture as inappropriate for a church setting, while others criticised Kanyari for allowing the situation to unfold without intervention. The backlash was intense, with people taking to various social media platforms to express their disapproval. How did Pastor Kanyari respond to the criticism? Consequently, Kanyari took to TikTok to express his frustrations over the situation. He broke down, saying the backlash had left him feeling isolated and depressed. The preacher went on to say that he had been forced to lock himself in his house and even close his businesses. He said he needed people to encourage him and gently correct him when he was wrong instead of just harshly criticising him. In his words: \"Nimejifungia kwa nyumba yangu. leo nimekaa. Hata sijafanya kazi. Nimesema leo hoteli yangu ifungwe nikasema duka zangu zifungwe. Leo that sijapata pesa. Sijaenda hata kwa bank. Hata sina chochote hapa. Ni mtu tu wa TikTok amenitumia KSh 20,000 nikamwambia mi hata sina haja ya pesa nataka tu mtu wa kunipa moyo, mtu wa kuniambia Kanyari don't worry. \"Kwanini mnataka kuniua, si mnirekebishe tu...kama nimekosea si mtu aniombee? Just pray for me.\" Kanyari went on to explain that he was not aware TikToker Faith would gift him condoms. He begged Kenyans for forgiveness , saying had he known what she was up to, he would have asked her off the pulpit. \"Sikuwa na security kanisani...hao mabodyguard mimi siwaekangi. Ndio maana ule msichana akachukua nafasi ile akaja na mipira kwa madhabahu na akaongea hiyo upumbavu. Sikuwa na akili ya haraka ya kusema msichana ondoka hapa,\" he said amid tears.

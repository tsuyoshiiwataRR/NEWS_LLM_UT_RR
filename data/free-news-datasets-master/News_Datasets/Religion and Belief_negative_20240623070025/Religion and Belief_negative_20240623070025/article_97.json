    "text": "Prophecy News - 'Judgement On My House' (and the, or My World), given to Sarah by Jesus, May 21st, 2024 Through his time on the Cross, Jesus became strong. The channel of energy between him and God (the All Parent) opened more. His body, the fleshly part, died, but His Spirit became strong – “unbreakable”, He said in His talk to the 144000.. So to be ‘humble’ is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength inwardly – the power flows (when the channel is cleared of its desire for earthly things, its attachments, called “chittas”). It’s that power when it flows from within us, or to us from above if you like, which saves. Not any earthly acquisition. So the path we are on is called “harmony through conflict’ or the path of the Heart-mind, and it’s not an external battle but an internal battle over the forces which seek to constrain us. The battle only erupts externally when people are weak and easily led… That’s what we are facing up to now. Our weakness. And for everyone who succeeds in the inner battle, it helps the whole, because mind to mind communication spreads and the mental atmosphere holds the key. Judgement On My House May 21, 2024 9:06 PM Pamela This word from the Lord was given to me on May 20-21st in the early morning hours. I pray that as you read through them my brother’s and sister’s in Christ that you will take them to heart and be in prayer for the corporate church of Christ today. Judgement is surely coming for the house of God which is not walking in accordance with the Spirit of God. It is important that we all examine our hearts and lives at this time and seek the will of the Lord! Prayers for the love and blessings of Jesus going out to you all! To Yahweh be the glory! Pamela G. I Peter 4:17-18 NKJV For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God? Now, if the righteous one is scarcely saved, Where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?” Word of Yeshua I speak forth this word through My servant to My church, My bride whose heart has been enticed by the ways of the world and who lives to seek her own pleasures and pursuits; to gain recognition and notoriety for herself! My judgements will rain down hard and without ceasing upon My house, the church who has squandered My great love and forsaken Me as her husband. This judgement comes for all those who believe themselves to be a part of My Kingdom work and ministry, who have turned to following their own ways and have left their first love behind. Your adulterous hearts have broken Mine, because you have sought to do your own will instead of seeking after Me! For this you will bring judgement down upon your own heads and unless you repent I cannot help you or deliver you from the dire judgements to come! Thus I will speak plainly to you about what is coming. I will pour out My wrath on all those who have done the work of their own hands and used My name profanely. Do you still not understand that you cannot mix the works of your flesh with the work of My Spirit? I will crush down on the threshing floor all those who claim to do My work and be My representatives, but are not, until they are pulverized into a fine powder like sand. The discipline of My threshing floor is necessary for you to enter into my Kingdom as purified wheat. This will be difficult but perhaps for some of you it will lead to repentance so that you will escape the wrath of hell itself. Isaiah 1:16-20 NKJV 16 Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; 17 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. 18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. 19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: 20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. I cannot take a puffed up prideful, weak and lean church into the battles against the dark side which are ahead. Much of the church as it stands is not equipped in their lukewarm state to fight the battles that lie before you! Instead you stand as tepid waters against me and you make Jezebel your constant companion. Your rebellion and double-mindedness will be your downfall and has led you to destruction. James 1:7-8 NKJV For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. The enemy will wash those lukewarm churches away quickly, because like sinking sand they have forfeited their foundation, which should be in Me. Do you not understand as I speak in My word? Matthew 7:21-23 NKJV 21 Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. 22 Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’ 23 And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’ To carry My standard you must rise above the flood waters of evil by living in holiness, otherwise you will be enticed and carried away by the forceful tide of darkness that is coming, which even now is right at the door. Your hearts must be unequivocally Mine, with no wavering, having died to your flesh, crucified before Me! As My perfect unblemished bride you must have eyes which are fixed on Me and Me alone! I will not compete against your haughty and prideful spirits that seek to gain the accolades and riches of this world for yourselves. Those things belong in the domain of the enemy’s camp and are far, far away from Me. The depths of My love and mercy for you has no bounds and My grace for you is plentiful. However, I will not tolerate your sin and a compromising faith. You must come to Me in repentance quickly and be restored to a right relationship with me before My wrath is poured out upon you! So examine your hearts today, oh My church and discover what is lacking in you! Your inability to come to Me by faith, completely trusting in Me, and your unwillingness to walk in My Holiness, is truly distressing. You must walk fervently and your heart must be fully for Me or against Me, there is no middle ground that will remain after My winnowing process is complete! Though you think you are doing so many things to please Me, it is I who will assess the true intentions of the heart, and only I can see yours which is lacking as a worldly church. Good intentions do not impress me, but a heart and life committed to holiness will indeed bring me joy! Revelation 3:15-22 NKJV 15 I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I could wish you were cold or hot. 16 So then, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth. 17 Because you say, ‘I am rich, have become wealthy, and have need of nothing’—and do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked— 18 I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see. 19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.Therefore be zealous and repent. 20 Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me. 21 To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne. 22 “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.” Your time of extended grace to turn your hearts completely to Mine is closing. My servants the prophets have given you ample warnings for many years now and still you do not hear them. Rather you stubbornly resist unto your own desolation and destruction! Many so called leaders who consider themselves men of God leading your churches will be disgraced and will fall from their high and mighty platforms. Many too will forfeit their lives even as their sin comes out of hiding and is on display before the whole world. Congregations will fall apart and be scattered because they were never rooted and grounded in Me! Many lost and confused souls will wander in disillusionment and shame. Pray for them to come to Me quickly because they are perishing and the enemy desires to snatch them out of My hands! Do you not know that the winepress of My wrath and indignation is about to fall on the world and likewise to My lukewarm and compromising church? Isaiah 63:3-5 NKJV 3 I have trodden the winepress alone, And from the peoples no one was with Me. For I have trodden them in My anger, And trampled them in My fury; Their blood is sprinkled upon My garments, And I have stained all My robes. 4 For the day of vengeance is in My heart, And the year of My redeemed has come. 5 I looked, but there was no one to help, And I wondered That there was no one to uphold; Therefore My own arm brought salvation for Me; And My own fury, it sustained Me. Revelation 14:19-20 19 So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. 20 And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, up to the horses’ bridles, for one thousand six hundred furlongs [7 1/2 miles]. So too this will come to the unfaithful church as well as the unbelieving world! You, oh unfaithful haughty church, filled with the Spirit of Jezebel are guilty of leading many astray and right into the depths of hell itself, because you are afraid to confront the people about their sin! It’s more important to line your pockets with worldly material things and to live in luxury than to lead precious souls into My Kingdom and to fulfill My great commission. Matthew 28:19-20 NKJV 19 Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. What will become of you My beautiful bride that I long for with the greatest desire, as a husband wanting to consummate his union with the object of his affection, his wife? Will you be condemned along with the world or will you enter the wedding chamber with me and sup with Me for all eternity? Isaiah 62:1-5 1 For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent, for Jerusalem’s sake I will not remain quiet, till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch. 2 The nations will see your vindication, and all kings your glory; you will be called by a new name that the mouth of the Lord will bestow. 3 You will be a crown of splendor in the Lord’s hand, a royal diadem in the hand of your God. 4 No longer will they call you Deserted, or name your land Desolate. But you will be called Hephzibah (My delight is in her; married) and your land Beulah for the Lord will take delight in you, and your land will be married [joined]. 5 As a young man marries a young woman, so will your Builder marry you; as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your God rejoice over you. Do you not love me enough to desire to build My Kingdom rather than your own which only brings recognition to you in the eyes of men? Is not My Kingdom and what I have to offer you through humble hearts and contrite spirits which fear me, far greater? The kingdom’s which you build on the earth will end in death, whereas those true followers of My Kingdom will inherit the blessings of eternity and everlasting life. Is it not My Kingdom come and my will be done on earth as it is in heaven enough for you? Even now as I pronounce words of judgment against you I AM still pleading with you to turn your hearts to Me and to examine yourselves My church, My bride before judgement is fully released upon you! Choose this day oh church, who you will serve! Judgement is coming for all of My house. Will you be able to withstand the fires of My judgement and My wrath which is to be poured out on all those who have turned their hearts away from Me? Some of you will rise, and even greater giftings in My might and power will be given to you in this hour, as in the parable of the talents. And for others even what has been given to you will be taken away because of your lack of faith in me! Matthew 25:14-30 The days of Pentacost are fast approaching when I will pour our My Sprit on all those who are My true followers who walk with Me in Spirit and in truth! It will be just as in the days of old when Elijah My servant walked under My annointing power to perform great miracles and manifestations on the earth. This was done to make My name known to all the nations so that they might repent and believe on Me. So you will do likewise My beautiful, beloved bride! Humble your hearts before Me, turn away from your flesh, seek My face alone and raise up your hearts to Me as living holy sacrifices so I might use you to be My authentic church! Live as My Book of Acts followers did. I encourage you to meditate upon and study these scriptures so you might understand how to walk, live and be My witnesses to your generations. As My apostles walked at that time, so will you again My end times warrior bride! The greatest work of My kingdom is yet to come and I desire that you will be beside Me as fit vessels made ready for My use in declaring My name and power throughout the earth! Will you join Me, My bride? Can I count on you to stand with Me in the hour of testing that is to come upon the world? For those who do and remain faithful to Me until the end I promise to give you the crown of eternal life, for your names will be written in the Lamb’s book of life and you will abide with Me in My Kingdom forever!

    "text": "CHENNAI/MADURAI: AIADMK on Saturday strongly criticized BJP state president K Annamalai’s remarks that late chief minister J Jayalalithaa was a “far superior” Hindutva leader. V K Sasikala, a close aide of Jayalalithaa hit out at Annamalai, saying that his reference to the late CM showed his ignorance and misunderstanding of her.In a statement released by the AIADMK headquarters, former minister and senior party functionary D Jayakumar criticised Annamalai for trying to portray Jayalalithaa solely as a Hindu and tarnish her reputation for “his own political gain and fame” in Tamil Nadu. He said Jayalalithaa transcended caste and religion, and showed respect to everyone. “She was uncompromisingly committed to protecting people of all religions and respecting their beliefs. As long as Tamil Nadu politics exists, Jayalalithaa's reputation as a leader for all will remain,” Jayakumar said.In an interview with PTI, Annamalai said Jayalalithaa was the first politician in the country, apart from BJP leaders, to endorse the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya and implement an anti-conversion law in Tamil Nadu in 2002-03. Jayakumar recalled the programmes that Jayalalithaa launched during her tenure in office, including ‘Annadhanam’ in temples. She initiated a scheme to provide free rice to mosques for making gruel during the holy month of Ramzan. The former chief minister also introduced government financial aid for Christians to go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.Demolition of Babri Masjid led to violence in other states, but Jayalalithaa ensured there was no violence in TN and made it a haven of peace, Jayakumar said.In Madurai, former minister R B Udhayakumar alleged that Annamalai's remarks were politically motivated. “He could instead become a member of the AIADMK if he wants to adopt the principles of Amma,” he said, asking Annamalai to praise BJP leaders like Vajpayee, Advani or even Savarkar if he wanted to attract people’s attention.Sasikala said Jayalalithaa was a remarkable leader, earning respect and admiration of individuals of diverse backgrounds, regardless of caste or religion. She remained a true Dravidian leader until her passing, continuing the legacy of former chief ministers C N Annadurai and M G Ramachandran. “It is a well-known fact that she believed in God. But she never had religious faith. She was a leader who consistently treated everyone equally throughout her life,” said Sasikala.",

    "text": "MONSIGNOR Rudy Villanueva, an icon in Cebuano church liturgical music, passed away at 11:30 p.m. Thursday, May 23, 2024. He was 83. Villanueva, who used the pen name Renato E. Madrid, had been an important part of the devotion to Saint Pedro Calungsod, being the composer of many devotional songs to him, including “Way Sukod man ang Pagmahal,” “By the Power of Your Giving,” and the “Gozos of Saint Pedro Calungsod.” His other notable songs are \"Sugbuanon nga Simbahan,\" \"Umari ka,\" \"Espiritu Santo,\" and \"Cebu, Cebu.\" Villanueva had also made significant contributions to both secular and religious literature, writing plays in both English and Cebuano. He was also a trained composer and conductor. He published five books of Cebuano music and recorded his compositions, demonstrating his dedication to Cebuano culture. His renowned liturgical works included choral compositions, Masses, and musical dramas. He had published “Southern Harvest” \"Devil Wings\" (1997) and \"Mass for the Death of an Enemy\" (2000). His collection \"Southern Harvest\" included award-winning stories originally published in the Philippines Free Press and Asian Leader. Villanueva's academic background is equally impressive. He studied Philosophy and Theology at San Carlos Seminary in Cebu, literature at the University of Santo Tomas, and Music Composition at Mankato State University in Minnesota. In his younger years, Villanueva was on the staff at San Carlos Seminary in Cebu and taught at St. Joseph Seminary and Silliman University Music School in Dumaguete, which highlighted his commitment to education and mentorship in both religious and artistic fields. In 2022, the Cebu City Government awarded Villanueva the Order of Rajah Humabon Award for his outstanding achievement in the arts, music, and literature. (AML)",

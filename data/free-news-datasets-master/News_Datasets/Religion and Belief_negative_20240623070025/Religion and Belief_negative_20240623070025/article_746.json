    "text": "alleged lawyer of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC), the megachurch founded by televangelist Apollo Quiboloy, surrendered 21 firearms to the authorities on Saturday.\nIn a statement, the Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (PNP-CIDG) said the operation was carried out at 6:30 a.m. at the KOJC compound in Davao City.\nA certain Atty. Israelito surrendered the firearms belonging to a certain Cresente Chavez Canada ''for safekeeping,'' the PNP-CIDG said.\nAmong the firearms that were surrendered were rifles, pistols, shotguns, and revolvers, as well as ammunition, and pistol magazines.\nAll the surrendered firearms are now in the custody of the local CIDG in Davao for proper documentation.\nQuiboloy’s camp has already surrendered several firearms registered to the controversial religious leader. They promised to surrender more soon.\nIn late April, the PNP revoked Quiboloy’s gun permit in light of the charges he is facing in the Philippines and in the United States.\nThe Senate earlier issued an arrest order against Quiboloy for refusing to appear at hearings on his alleged involvement in the sexual abuse and human trafficking of the members of his Davao-based megachurch.\nA Davao court also sought the arrest of Quiboloy and five others for child abuse charges.\nA Pasig court also issued an arrest warrant against the pastor for human trafficking charges. — VBL, GMA Integrated News",

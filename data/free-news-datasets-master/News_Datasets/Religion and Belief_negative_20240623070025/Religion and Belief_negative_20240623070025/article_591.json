    "text": "With heavy hearts the family of Joe wishes to announce his peaceful passing on May 23, 2024 at University Hospital. Joe was born in Budapest, Hungary to Magda and Sandor Weis. After the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, Joe left Hungary and arrived in Canada in March of 1958. Once he joined the Canadian Army he ended up in London, Ontario and met Barbara Ruppe at a dance at the German Canadian Club. They were married on September 28, 1963. Son Martin and daughter Susanne were born in 1964. In 2023 Barbara and Joe celebrated 60 years of happy marriage. During their time together they travelled to a total of 42 countries – always happy to come home to London.\nJoe is survived by his wife Barbara; son Martin (Carey Yates) and daughter Susanne Russell (the late Glenn); grandchildren Jessica Russell, Stephanie Russell (Keith Queen), Alisha Weis (Marc Edwards), Jocelyn Weis (Derek Blaney), Thalia Weis (Andrew Schneider), Ryan Smale, Lindsay Smale, and Holly Smale; great-grandchildren Aiden Collins, Owen Collins, Emmaleigh Collins, Sophia Shushkewich, Simon Blaney, Heath Weis, Mila Weis and Claire Edwards.\nThank you to all the medical teams at Univeristy Hospital and the home care teams during the last difficult year. Interment at Mount Pleasant Cemetery, 303 Riverside Drive, London, on Monday, May 27 at 1 p.m.\nRest in peace dearest Joe.\nwww.HarrisFuneralHome.ca\nPublished online May 25, 2024\nIn Memory of Joseph (Joe)When is the\n[ordering deadline?](javascript:void(0))\nIn Memory of Joseph (Joe)How does\n[it work?](javascript:void(0))\nSend Flowers: When Is the Ordering Deadline?\nANY DAY OF THE WEEK\nOrder any time up till the day before\nMON-FRI Order by 2:00PM\nSAT & SUN Order by noon\nTUES-SAT\nOrder by 3:00PM\nThe day before\nSAT & SUN Order by Saturday\nNote: These are general guidelines; some florists may not be able to operate within these timelines.

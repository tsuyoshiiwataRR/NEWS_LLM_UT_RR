    "text": "Qadri seeks accountability of those involved in controversial case ruling Opinion could have been sought from IIC on such a sensitive issue: Hamid Bringing political battle to home, families lamentable: Nasir Abbas Naseem Shah says women, children, elders even not targeted in war ISLAMABAD: Religious scholars and muftis from various schools of thought jointly called the court’s decision convicting Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Founding Chairman Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi in the Iddat case immoral, illegal, politically motivated and contrary to Islamic principles, demanding the top court to null and void the controversial decision.\nSpeaking at a press conference here on Saturday, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM) Secretary-General Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Sahibzada Hamid Raza, the Chairman of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), religious scholar MNA Maulana Naseem Shah, former federal Minister for Religious Affairs Noorul Haque Qadri said that they were holding a press conference purely on the dubious and most controversial decision against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi in Iddat case.\nHe said that today, the scholars of all sects and schools of thoughts were present on the occasion, who were agreed on the point that in dispute over nikkah issue, that only the woman’s testimony was deemed credible and final.\nNoorul Haque Qadri stated that the decision given in the Iddat case was not very controversial but against the very teachings of the Qur’an and the Sunnah.\nHe said that the very contentious verdict was seemingly given under the pressure of unknowns and demanded that all the involved in this unjust and heinous act should be brought to justice.\nThe scholar urged that those involved in this plot should seek forgiveness from Allah and the victims for misusing Islamic laws.\nQadir went on to say that in the court decision, the Sharia orders were violated and a well-planned character assassination against a veiled woman, which was shameful and despicable.\nHe stated that the sacred relation of nikka was made controversial, as it would be used an excuse by males to drag female in the court, thus the disputed decision would prove lethal for family and marital life.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Sahibzada Hamid Raza said that the honor of a woman and the wife of founder PTI were targeted under the pretext of the most shameful iddat case, as it not a condemnable but absurd and disgusting judgement.\nHe said that in our society, women are kept away from such matters, as even in hostilities, personal enmity and tribal feuds, women’s sanctity and honour remained intact.\nHamid Raza stated that no one has the authority to change the well-defined Shaira rules, but all limits of modesty, Islamic jurisprudence and sunnah were crossed in this abominable decision.\nHe noted that an opinion could have been sought from the Islamic Ideological Council on such a sensitive issue.\nHamid Raza warned PML-N against registering new cases against Imran Khan and said that they compiled massive materials about Nawaz, Maryam and Khwaja Asif and others’ past statements against army chiefs, which was enough to be filed 45 FIRs against them.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Senator Raja Nasir Abbas said that the woman’s testimony was valid in the issue of Idda but unfortunately they brought the political battle to home and even families were not safe now, which was shameful and condemnable.\nHe said that there was a lot of beauty in the eastern civilization, where mothers, daughters and sisters held great respects.\nNasir Abbas stated that Bushra Bibi was a veiled woman, thus it was condemnable to humiliate her. He demanded that the judge who awarded sentence to PTI Founder and his spouse should be questioned about his knowledge on Islam and religion and his mental health should be checked.\nHe said that it was not right to enter into the divine boundaries and this decision was issued against the order of Allah.\nThe senator expressed optimism that the Supreme Court (SC) would declare void the ruling and even would suggest remedial measures to close this chapter for good.\nOn the occasion, Naseem Shah made it clear that there was no two opinions about this controversial issue, as it did not have any legal, moral and religious grounds.\nHe said that they waged all-out war against Imran Khan and he had been in captivity and facing the state brutalities\nThe MNA stated that it was even against the rules of war to target women, children and elders, adding that the power wielders were setting wrong precedent.\nHowever, he hoped that the top court would bury this case forever.",

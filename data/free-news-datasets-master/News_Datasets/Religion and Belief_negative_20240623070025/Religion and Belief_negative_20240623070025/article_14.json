    "text": "Gospel Singer Reuben Kigame Cautions Kenyans Against Following Pastor Kanyari: \"Run, Mute, Block\" - Pastor Kanyari has been under scrutiny for some time due to his preachings, prompting criticism from various leaders - Singer Rueben Kigame has joined the critics of Kanyari, describing his preachings and claimed miracles as misleading - This comes after MCSK chair Ezekiel Mutua condemned the now infamous preacher for his teachings on TikTok PAY ATTENTION: Leave your feedback about TUKO.co.ke. Fill in [this short form](https://forms.gle/vjFMUWfZB4UH23uTA). Help us serve you better! [Gospel Singer](https://www.tuko.co.ke/383731-who-richest-gospel-singer-world-top-list.html) Rueben Kigame has joined a section of individuals who have cautioned Kenyans about following Pastor Victor Kanyari on his social media platforms. What has Kigame said about Kanyari? Kigame took to his social media platforms to caution Kenyans about following Kanyari. He advocated for Christians to wholly denounce Kanyari's ministry. PAY ATTENTION: Share your outstanding story with our editors! Please reach us through news@tuko.co.ke or WhatsApp: 0732482690. \"Run! Mute! Block! Ignore! Avoid, and join me in condemning in the strongest terms possible the wayward and ungodly conduct, teaching, and practices of “Pastor” Victor Kanyari,\" he said. He asserted that Kanyari sets a negative example for both Christians and non-Christians, exploiting the [names](https://www.tuko.co.ke/tags/names/) of God, the Church, and Christ inappropriately. Why is Kigame asking people to avoid Kanyari? The gospel singer provided three key reasons for his request to Kenyans to disregard Pastor Kanyari. These reasons include: First, he alleged that Kanyari is not a pastor but a dangerous apostate who actively promotes indecent sexual allurements, particularly on social media platforms. Additionally, he alleged that ever since Kanyari joined [TikTok](https://www.tuko.co.ke/tags/tiktok/), he engages in speech and actions that promote obscenity, tarnishing the values of both the young and the elderly, all while invoking the names of God, Jesus, and the Church. Secondly, Kigame asserted that Kanyari misuses the names of God, Jesus, Church, and ministry. He further stated that the now infamous pastor has ridiculed evangelism and prayer, and in his reckless behavior, invoking the name of God while publicly seducing women. \"On many TV broadcasts and, more recently, on TikTok, he will employ such phrases as, “God bless you”, “Mungu akubariki”, “Praise God”, “Ngai”, “Mwathani”, “Jesus”, etc. sarcastically and in jest.\" Finally, he accused Kanyari of deceiving followers into giving up their hard-earned money by claiming to perform miracles. He also urged the government to expedite his arrest for such conduct. Ezekiel Mutua slams Kanyari over online misconduct Earlier, Ezekiel Mutua, head of the Music Copyright Society of [Kenya](https://kiswahili.tuko.co.ke/tags/siasa-za-kenya/) (MCSK), had [condemned Pastor Victor Kanyari](https://www.tuko.co.ke/entertainment/celebrities/549445-ezekiel-mutua-slams-pastor-kanyari-online-misconduct-vows-stop-mockery-faith/) for his controversial behavior and remarks on TikTok. Kanyari has been noted for using inappropriate language while interacting with fans on the social media platform. Mutua contended that individuals like Kanyari, who have deviated from their roles as moral authorities, contribute to the moral decline among young people.

    "text": "I wrote earlier about how Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) let the cat out of the bag when she spoke about lawfare keeping former President Donald Trump in New York, and that was why he was holding a rally in the South Bronx. She didn't seem to realize that she was acknowledging that the lawfare was acting as election interference. READ MORE: [AOC Lets the Cat Out of the Bag on Trump Lawfare and Rally in South Bronx](https://redstate.com/nick-arama/2024/05/23/aoc-remarks-about-trump-lawfare-n2174561) It's not her district but it is her backyard, and she's clearly throwing a fit that people in the South Bronx have had enough of Biden and the leftists. A Politico reporter tweeted about the heavy rain this morning, predicting it would be a \"muddy mess\" in Crotona Park for the Trump rally. AOC responded saying, \"God is good.\" God is Good üôèüèΩ‚Äî Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) [https://t.co/YUUCPhZ4oJ] [May 23, 2024] She's essentially wishing ill on the South Bronx rallygoers -- that the rally will be a mess for them -- and she's invoking the name of God in that wish. Not exactly a good look. But she's a petty child, and she shows that again here. They've had enough to deal with for years with the Democrats, and they are anxious for a change. But AOC doesn't understand Trump supporters. They line up for hours before events, come rain or shine. Before the rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, dozens of people including a friend of mine camped on the beach the night before. They're not put off by a little rain or mud. And the rain cleared and the weather was great by the afternoon. Trump supporters responded with the best possible response Thursday: showing up in droves, by the hundreds and now, it looks like the thousands. Maybe New York is becoming a little bit less blue, if this is any indication. Warning for graphic language: God certainly is good üôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèº‚Äî Dweller (@soaringwaters77) [https://t.co/N9IWtRoRvi] [pic.twitter.com/DhJ6qdDGqt] [May 23, 2024] Bronx is Ready for President Trump!‚Äî Gavin Mario Wax üá∫üá∏ üóΩüçä (@GavinWax) [pic.twitter.com/YuCCLZlrMq] [May 23, 2024] To quote‚Äî Spitfire (@DogRightGirl) [@AOC] ‚ÄúGod is good!‚Äùüôèüèºüá∫üá∏ [pic.twitter.com/FXppFCn0H6] [May 23, 2024] Long line outside Trumps rally at Crotona Park in the South Bronx‚Äî Timcast News (@TimcastNews) [pic.twitter.com/zGqk01ZROO] [May 23, 2024] Kids were even excited that a rapper showed up.

[pic.twitter.com/UVVtw3pWEi] [May 23, 2024] The venue permit was for 3,500, but it looks like they are more than that already; the lines to get in are long. People also reminded AOC that folks in the Bronx while they will come out for Trump, they haven't come out for her, posting a view of an event that she had that was sparsely attended, although it did have protesters. Lol‚Äî aka (@akafacehots) [@AOC]crowds look like a Joe Biden rally [pic.twitter.com/5xOihUgKoF] [May 23, 2024] I think that someone is going to have to go check on AOC; she probably isn't handling this well. I think I feel another tantrum coming from her after she gets rebuked so badly. This is a big message to other Democrats and Biden as well. People are not going to be taken for granted, and they're sounding off today. Update [6:05 p.m. EDT]: We couldn't resist adding this perfect reaction as an update! God is ABSOLUTELY GREAT! Look at the sunshine he has delivered for us today. When everyone said it was going to rain, God has given us a beautiful day. Glory to God ‚Äî and long live Donald J. Trump!‚Äî Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) [@revrubendiaz] [https://t.co/MMI1Z3b85s] [pic.twitter.com/oIWLQp7dSP] [May 23, 2024]",

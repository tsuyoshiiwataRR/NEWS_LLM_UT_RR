    "text": "States Â» NorthPosted at: May 25 2024 1:54PM INDI alliance is anti-Hindu: YogiGorakhpur, May 25 (UNI) Reacting strongly to his West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee's controversial remarks on globally renowned spiritual institutions like Bharat Sevashram Sangh and Ramakrishna Mission, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday painted the entire INDIA bloc of the opposition parties, including the Congress, TMC, RJD, SP as \"anti-Hindu\" in spirit. Talking to the reporters in the Gorakhnath Temple complex before leaving for Ballia to campaign for the final phase of Lok Sabha elections earlier in the day, the CM accused the alliance of prioritising power over nation. \"These parties want power at the cost of the country and no Indian will accept this,\" he said. Referring to the controversial statement made by the TMC chief Banerjee against Bharat Sevashram Sangh and Ramakrishna Mission in West Bengal, he said that both organisations are esteemed religious and spiritual institutions in India. He praised Ramakrishna Mission, which follows the ideals of Swami Vivekananda, for its commendable work in promoting the values and principles of Sanatan Dharma and India's spiritual heritage across the country and the world. Yogi said, \"Similarly, Bharat Sevashram Sangh is an influential spiritual organisation, which has done commendable work in promoting the values and principles of Sanatan Dharma both within India and globally, following the ideals of Swami Pranavananda. Both organisations have also advanced numerous service projects worldwide.\" He pointed out that opposing Sanatan Dharma and Hindus, is at the foundation of the politics followed by INDI alliance constituents including Congress, SP, TMC, RJD and Aam Aadmi Party and the statements made by its leaders, including Mamata Banerjee, reflects their frustration over its impending defeat. Praising the Mission and Sevashram for their extensive efforts in promoting spirituality and culture through commendable service projects both in India and around the world, the CM cited Swami Vivekananda, who had proudly declared that we should say with pride that we are Hindus. He said that the followers and devotees of these esteemed organisations will give a befitting reply to Congress, TMC and the INDI alliance. He compared the current situation to the era of Ravana when sages were threatened, asserting that Sanatan Dharma will not be intimidated by such provocations and will respond decisively. Yogi said that while the INDI alliance parties are threatening Hindu religious and spiritual institutions, they are also undermining the rights of backward caste people. He pointed out that in 2010, the TMC government in West Bengal diluted OBC reservations by including 118 Muslim castes in the OBC category, depriving millions of individuals from backward castes of reservation benefits over the past 14 years. He demanded an apology from Mamata Banerjee's TMC government and Congress for this injustice meted out to the OBC community. The CM emphasised that taking away the rights of youth and citizens is unacceptable and contrary to the principles of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar, who clearly stated that reservations should not be based on religion.

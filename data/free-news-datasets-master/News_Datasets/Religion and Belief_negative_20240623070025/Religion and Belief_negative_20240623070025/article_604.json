    "text": "Reports\nGround Report From Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh: How A Hindu Couple Who Was Tricked Into Islamic Conversion 20 Years Ago Recently Did 'Ghar Wapsi'\nSwati Goel Sharma\nMay 25, 2024, 01:54 PM | Updated 01:54 PM IST\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the\nSwarajya app.\nTwo decades ago, when Shiv Prasad Lodhi and his wife Kavita sought help from their village pradhan to obtain government identity documents, their request led to a life-altering conversation.\nAccording to the couple, the pradhan, Mohammed Amil Sheikh, agreed to assist but suggested it was the right time to consider his long-standing suggestion – that the couple should adopt Islamic identities.\nShiv Prasad expressed reluctance, but Amil Sheikh insisted that was the only way he could help them. How else, he asked, could the couple survive in an all-Muslim village?\nShiv Prasad and Kavita found no counterargument and no viable alternatives.\nThree years prior, the couple had relocated from their native Varanasi to Amil’s all-Muslim village, Poore Adhari, in Hathgaon block of Uttar Pradesh’s Fatehpur district. They had come in search of employment, but without any identity documents.\nThe couple acquiesced to Sheikh's suggestion.\nSoon after, they received their respective Aadhaar cards, voter cards, and ration card. Shiv Prasad was listed as ‘Abdulla, son of Jabbar’. Shiv Prasad told this correspondent that Jabbar was an imaginary name provided by Amil Sheikh to the authorities; his father's name is Devnath.\nKavita’s name appeared as ‘Fatma, wife of Abdulla’ or daughter of Amil. In the ID card photos, she is seen wearing a burqa. She clarifies, “I have never bought a burqa in these twenty years. It was always the residents who gave me one to wear.”\nFour months ago, the couple publicly did a ‘ghar wapsi’ ritual.\nThey participated in a havan just outside their house, attended by scores of saffron-clad men from a local organisation named Ram Bal (Strength of Lord Ram).\nThe havan was conducted amid police security, signalling to the village that they were reverting to their original religious identities and embracing their former names.\n“We were tricked into conversion,\" Kavita told this correspondent. \"We would have liked Amil [Sheikh] to witness the ritual but he passed away a few years ago.\"\nAs per Kavita, Amil was likely over 70 years of age.\nAccording to Shiv Prasad and Kavita, they are natives of Dulahipur village in Chandauli block of Varanasi district. They married, in an alliance fixed by their families, about 25 years ago.\nTragic circumstances soon compelled them to sell their home and leave the village within two years of their wedding.\nShiv Prasad’s brother, his only sibling, succumbed to an illness. His parents had passed away when he was still a child, leaving him orphaned after his brother’s death. Kavita, who has no sibling, gave birth to a daughter, but the infant died on the sixth day.\nWith no clear direction, they sought the advice of a neighbour who worked in another district. Following his recommendation, the couple shifted to the area where the neighbour lived and worked.\nThanks to the neighbour, who was from the Muslim community, Shiv Prasad found work. The couple rented a place in the village.\nThey settled in well. In their new home, Kavita became pregnant again, and the couple hoped their days of misfortune were over. It seemed that the change in environment was finally bringing them luck.\nHowever, in the eighth month of her pregnancy, Kavita suffered a miscarriage. She was devastated. Neighbours began visiting her to offer condolences.\nThe women suggested that worshipping her Hindu gods was bringing her no fortune, and that she should instead pray at a local dargah.\nDesperate for hope, Kavita started following their advice.\nDuring this time, she also began working as a househelp at pradhan Amil’s house, where her lifestyle underwent significant changes.\nAt the behest of Amil’s family, she stopped wearing sari and adopted the salwar suit, the prevalent attire for women in the village. She also stopped wearing a bindi and sindoor, as discouraged by Amil’s family. She was told to live as the other women in the village did.\nWithin two years, the couple saved enough to buy a small plot just outside the village. The plot was owned by Amil Sheikh and the deal was finalised for Rs 40,000.\nIt was during this land transaction that Shiv Prasad realised the need for government documents to register the plot in his name. He requested Amil Sheikh for assistance.\n“He [Sheikh] told me that since I had no original documents in the name of Shiv Prasad, it was an opportune time for a name change to fully integrate,\" Shiv Prasad told this correspondent. \"I am illiterate. I attended the school until Class 2. I did as told.\"\nSoon after Shiv Prasad agreed, a ceremony was organised in the local mosque where the couple recited the Kalma, or the Islamic oath of allegiance. Shiv Prasad says Alim Sheikh told him it was a mere formality.\nA month later, the documents arrived.\nThe couple says their harassment began soon after and has persisted for two decades.\nFollowing their paper conversion, neighbours began demanding that they completely adopt Islamic ways. Shiv Prasad was often reprimanded for not attending mosques for namaz.\nKavita was discouraged from observing Navratri fasts and urged to keep roze instead, \"in line with village custom\". Public celebration or observation of their Hindu beliefs was no longer possible. They kept all practices indoors.\nPressure was also mounting on Shiv Prasad to undergo khatna, or circumcision.\nWhen he approached Amil Sheikh to register the deal, he was told he should first undergo khatna, as was customary. After several attempts, Shiv Prasad gave up on asking for the papers, fearing he would be pressured again.\nEven today, the house remains in Sheikh’s name, says Shiv Prasad, causing him constant anxiety. His attempts to get Sheikh’s sons transfer the property in his name have resulted in ugly spats.\nRefusing to undergo khatna also led to social ostracism, affecting his work opportunities. Shiv Prasad eventually started traveling to Mumbai for seasonal work, leaving Kavita alone.\nIn her husband's absence, Kavita began facing pressure from neighbours to adopt a baby from the village. They told her a woman should not be without a child.\nSensing this as a ploy to eventually take their house, Kavita refused, stating it was God’s will that she remained childless.\nOver the years, Kavita has grown accustomed to living in isolation. She has no friends or relatives and keeps to herself indoors.\nOn the day this correspondent visited, Kavita did not open the door for an hour despite repeated knocks. A neighbour, Anjum Begum, said ‘Fatma’ does not speak to anyone in the village.\nJust when this correspondent was about to leave the village without talking to her, Kavita opened the door. Expressing delight that someone had come to visit her from New Delhi, she said she had heard the knocks but deliberately did not open the door.\nShe later opened it only to see if it was her husband, as she had just realised that her phone was discharged.\nTowards the end of last year, Shiv Prasad and Kavita learned about an organisation named Ram Bal, whose members resided in a Hindu village about two kilometers away.\nThe couple visited them, seeking protection from ongoing harassment over circumcision and child adoption.\nThe activists approached the police and organised a public havan to send a clear message to the village: the couple was no longer Muslim.\nAgendra Sahu, 40, who heads the organisation, told this correspondent over the phone that it was Shiv Prasad’s desire to perform ‘ghar wapsi’ and the organisation merely facilitated it.\nBoth Shiv Prasad and Kavita are pleased with the public ceremony, which was attended by numerous policemen, giving them a sense of security. However, their documents still bear the names Abdulla and Fatma.\nThe organisation informed them that they must visit the district court to rectify this issue. The couple however says that all their attempts so far have been unsuccessful.\n“Lawyers have been ambiguous about what needs to be done. Some said it’s not possible since we don’t have any documents under our original names. Others are demanding exorbitant fee which we cannot afford,” says Shiv Prasad.\nHe added, “We will try again after the elections. Maybe everyone is busy right now.\"\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the\nSwarajya app.\nSwati Goel Sharma is a senior editor at Swarajya.

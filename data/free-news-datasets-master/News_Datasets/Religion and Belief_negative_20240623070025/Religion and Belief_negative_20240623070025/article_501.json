    "text": "In an editorial Zsolt Jeszenszky lectured on the connection between anti-Semitism in Hungary and Péter Nádas on the Pesti Srácok. The principle declare of the article is actually that anti-Semitism in our nation is “getting new energy” due to the orphaning Jews – on the similar time, the writer is outwardly being attentive to solely not directly Jewizing when he writes the next:\n“And when the Márias, Lászlós Juszt, and László Dés of Vásárhely, being so indifferent from actuality, not coping with the details, blather not solely in a self-defeating method, however with an infinitely obnoxious, visceral hatred, then anti-Semitism is re-invigorated a bit of.”\nBased on Jeszenszky, there are additionally those that take motion towards anti-Semitism alongside them, corresponding to Imre Kertész and Viktor Orbán, “who preserve glorious relations not solely with Israel and its prime minister, but in addition with a big variety of home Jewish organizations and their distinguished representatives.”\nJeszenszky is cautious, he doesn’t enterprise into the sphere of aesthetics. He places it like this:\n“How good a author is Péter Nádas? I do not know. From me, as a author, it’d even be good. However humanly, he is a cretin.”\nBy the way, the editorial is about the truth that Nádas, as a white man, didn’t obtain a literary award as a result of the jury needed to fulfill the standards of political correctness a lot that in the long run the worth of the works grew to become secondary.\nAnd the way does orphaning and anti-Semitism in Hungary observe from this? No approach. That’s the reason Nádas recollects Jeszenszky his interview two years in the past by which the author (that’s, Péter Nádas) talked about how the Hungarian navy management in all probability stationed troops on the Ukrainian border the day after the Russian invasion as a result of Orbán might get a promise from Putin.\nLastly, the publicist concludes the article:\n“Nicely, with such stinging sentences, such Péter Nádas do essentially the most to make sure that Hungarian anti-Semitism, which is disappearing, generally good points new energy.”\nIt might solely be good to know whether or not Zsolt Jeszenszky checks the origin of everybody who criticizes the prime minister?",

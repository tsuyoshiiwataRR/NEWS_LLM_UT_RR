    "text": "Washington, D.C. Newsroom, May 24, 2024 / 16:08 pm The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and other Catholic institutions [filed a lawsuit](https://becketnewsite.s3.amazonaws.com/20240522224428/2024-05-22-1-Complaint.pdf) against President Joe Biden’s administration over new rules that could require them to provide workplace accommodations for women who seek abortions. The lawsuit challenges [regulations issued](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/257405/biden-administration-to-mandate-employers-grant-leave-for-workers-to-obtain-abortions) by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) related to the implementation of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The Catholic University of America (CUA) and two Catholic dioceses joined the USCCB in the lawsuit. Although the law itself does not mention abortion, the regulations would require that employers accommodate women for workplace limitations that arise from “having or choosing not to have an abortion.” The law requires that employers provide reasonable accommodations to women who develop workplace limitations from pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The EEOC rules consider “having or choosing not to have an abortion” as one of the related medical conditions covered under the legislation.",

    "text": "Richmond’s First Baptist Church leaves Southern Baptist Convention RICHMOND, Va. (WWBT) - Richmond’s [First Baptist Church](https://fbcrichmond.org/) voted on Sunday to withdraw from the Southern Baptist Convention. “There were no cheers, no shouts of celebration, and if there were tears, I didn’t see them,” said Pastor Jim Somerville. “What I felt from the room was a mixture of quiet grief and gratitude, along with a sense that we had done the right thing.” The church has been part of the SBC for nearly 180 years. The church’s board of deacons recommended to withdraw in response to the SBC’s proposal requiring pastors and elders of its cooperating churches to be men. “We believe every Baptist church has the right to determine its own mission and ministry and to ordain whomever it perceives to be gifted for ministry, whether male or female,” Somerville said. First Baptist Church, which was established in 1780, says it has two female pastors on staff. “What that meant for First Baptist is that the SBC didn’t want us anymore, because we are not about to give up our female pastors,” Somerville said. “Lynn Turner and Allison Collier have those titles, but we have a number of other female ministers on our staff. We’re not giving them up either.” Copyright 2024 WWBT. All rights reserved.",

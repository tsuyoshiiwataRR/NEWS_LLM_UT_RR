    "text": "‘Freeman’ charged with imprisoning ex-partner told cops he only recognises ‘God's law’\nGary McKee (31) allegedly pulled out a clump of the woman’s hair and chipped her tooth\nA man accused of imprisoning and subjecting an ex-partner to a serious assault told police he only recognises the law of God, a court heard today.\nGary McKee allegedly pulled out a clump of the woman’s hair and chipped her tooth during an attack in Belfast where she climbed out a window to escape.\nThe 31-year-old was arrested earlier this month as he tried to board a train for Dublin, a judge was told.\nAccording to the prosecution he answered no comment when questioned and made reference to maritime law.\n“He stated that he is a ‘freeman’, lives on his own sovereign ground and only recognises God’s law,” a Crown lawyer said.\nMcKee, of Farringdon Gardens in Belfast, faces charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and false imprisonment.\nThe city’s Magistrates Court heard police discovered the alleged victim with her face covered in blood on April 30.\nThe woman claimed McKee had arrived at the property in a drunken state and launched an attack in the hallway when she asked him to leave.\n“She said he punched her in the face and dragged her by the hair into the living room,” the prosecutor submitted.\nRead more\nMcKee then allegedly inflicted further blows and struck the woman on the head with a glass bottle before stopping her from leaving.\n“She escaped by climbing out the living room window and sought refuge in a neighbour’s house,” the lawyer added.\nDistrict Judge George Conner heard she sustained bruising to her face, a cut lip, bloodied nose, chipped tooth and had hair pulled from her head.\nMcKee was detained at a railway station on May 3.\nAs he mounted an application for bail, defence solicitor Feargal MacElhatton confirmed the charges are denied.\nMr McElhatton told the court McKee insists that he had tried to restrain the woman from self-harming, and that any injuries sustained were non-intentional.\nBail was refused, however, based on the risks of re-offending and interference with witnesses.\nRemanding McKee in custody until June 14, Judge Conner said: “While he may be a ‘freeman’ if he wishes, it doesn’t give me any confidence that he would comply.”",

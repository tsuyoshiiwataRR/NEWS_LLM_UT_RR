    "text": "1934 - 2024\nThe Lord has answered our prayers and called Georgina Lufkin to His heavenly home. A few months after her 90th birthday, it was clear that Georgie was ready to join her loving husband, Roger. She passed quietly and comfortably in her sleep, with family by her side, on May 19, 2024.\nShe is survived by her three children: Denis (Johnnie) Lufkin, Patricia (Bill) Harrison, and Paul (Tracy) Lufkin; 7 grandchildren: Ford Howard, Cody (Heather) Vossler, Corey (Michelle) Harrison, Tyler (Hailey) Harrison, Chad (Christina) Harrison, Josh Lufkin, and Matthew Lufkin; sisters, Carmen Tellier Smith (Les), Evelyn Redford (Ralph 2024), and Yvette Tellier (Mat 2017); as well as many other cherished relatives and friends.\nShe was predeceased by her loving husband, Roger (2021); their infant son, Richard (1961); and granddaughter, Sarah Nutt (2020).\nBorn Teresa Celina Georgina Tellier in February 1934, in Edmonton, Alberta, Georgie grew up in Morinville, Alberta. She attended Vermillion College (now Lakeland College) and received her certificate in Home Economics. She met and married the love of her life, Roger, and they enjoyed sharing life together for over 67 years. Georgie was very active in the community, having served in various leadership capacities with Catholic Women's League, St. Joseph Basilica, Westwind Estates Condominium Association, and the Rosedale Resident Council.\nGeorgie was a trail blazer and advocate for women in the workforce. Returning to work in the late '60's, she built a career in personnel first with Federated Coop, the Canadian Cancer Society, Alberta Land Titles, then finally landing with Canada Employment & Immigration. In the 1980's, she was happy to have some independence by being appointed the federal government's Employment Counselor on Campus at Grant MacEwan Community College (now MacEwan University), where she counseled and taught hundreds of young students on job search and post-graduation career opportunities. She retired from the department in 1994.\nThe Funeral Mass will be celebrated on Wednesday, May 29, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. MDT at the St Joseph's Basilica, 10044-113 St, Edmonton, Alberta, followed by a Reception. Visitation is available beginning at 9:00 a.m. A livestream of the Mass will be simulcast at\nwww.GeorgieLufkin.com (Passcode: 2024). The family would especially like to extend their thanks to the staff at Capital Care Grandview, Dr. Tom Ranieri, and his staff for years of care of both Georgie and Roger, as well Georgie's niece Michelle Pachal for providing support until her passing. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her honour at the Roots of Change Foundation (P.O. Box 92 St. Albert, AB Canada, T8N 1N2 www.rootsofchange.ca), an organization supporting individuals in Nicaragua to give them opportunities that lift them out of an environment of poverty, that was founded by her cousin, Father Denis Hebert.\nArrangements entrusted to Connelly-McKinley Downtown Chapel\nTo send condolences please visit\nwww.connelly-mckinley.com\nPublished online May 25, 2024\nIn Memory of T.C.

The First Liberty Institute said Thursday that the Petersburg National Battlefield has granted a permit for the Knights of Columbus Council 694 to hold its annual service, a tradition that dates back at least 60 years, after previously rejecting the group‚Äôs request. ‚ÄúWe are grateful to the NPS for allowing the Knights to hold their service this Memorial Day,‚Äù said John Moran, partner at McGuireWoods LLP in Washington, D.C., who represented the local council.

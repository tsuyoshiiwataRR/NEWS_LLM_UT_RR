    "text": "Two Tunisian-born brothers and a third Iraqi man are to face trial at Preston Crown Court on 7 October 2025, to answer terrorism-related charges, some of which was directed at the Jewish community in Manchester.\nWalid Saadaoui, 36, and Amar Hussein, 50, are accused of preparing acts of terrorism between 13 December 2023 and 9 May this year. Walid’s brother, Bilel Saadaoui, 35, is charged with failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism.\nOn Friday 24 May, after an initial hearing two weeks ago at Westminster Magistrates, the three men appeared by videolink from custody at Wormwood Scrubs Prison, for a hearing at London’s Central Criminal Court (the Old Bailey) in front of Mr Justice Jeremy Baker.\nProsecutor Jocelyn Ledward KC said that Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein had planned “an Isis or Daesh-inspired terrorist attack in the UK”, with the alleged intent “to cause multiple fatalities using automatic guns. The main targets of the attack plans were the Jewish community in the north-west of England, members of law enforcement and military”. Ms Ledward said that the prosecution alleged that the men “took significant steps to prepare for that attack”, which included the alleged “purchase and delivery of firearms”.\nThe trial, beginning in autumn next year, is anticipated to last in the region of 12 weeks. A detailed timetable of further hearings this year was agreed by the court.\nWalid Saadaoui, of Crankwood Road, Abram, Wigan, Bilel Saadaoui, of Fairclough Street, Hindley, Wigan, and Amar Hussein, of no fixed abode, spoke to confirm their identities during the hearing. The Saadaoui brothers were represented by barristers Irfan Arif and Nadesh Karu; Amar Hussein has so far chosen to represent himself.\nThe defendants were further remanded into custody.\n ",

    "text": "E very American should know about the “Bible trial,” the perilous case of Päivi Räsänen in Finland, which is shaping up to be one of the most important tests of religious liberty and freedom of speech in the history of the West.\nRäsänen, a long-serving member of the Finnish parliament who is also a medical doctor, pastor’s wife, and grandmother, is preparing to head to Finland’s Supreme Court in what is truly a modern-day witch trial.\nIn 2019, Räsänen’s church decided to sponsor a “pride” parade. She responded by posting some Bible verses on Twitter and asking how that decision aligned with Scripture. You might expect that to have led to some debate or perhaps even tension, possibly a meeting with church leaders. Instead, she faced criminal prosecution eerily reminiscent of the Soviet Union.\nGovernment officials ransacked Räsänen’s private life, rummaged through 20 years of public statements, and interrogated her on her personal theology. In the process, they dug up a 2004 church pamphlet she had authored on marriage and sexuality, as well as comments she made on a 2019 radio show. Government prosecutors charged Räsänen with three counts of “agitation against a minority group” under the war-crimes statute of Finnish law. A Lutheran bishop, Juhana Pohjola, was charged alongside her for publishing the pamphlet.\nIn early 2022, Räsänen and Pohjola were put on trial. If convicted, they faced potential fines and even years in prison. Finnish state prosecutors proceeded to put the Bible on trial, attacking verses they disagreed with and grilling the defendants about their theological beliefs.\nRäsänen and the bishop were unanimously acquitted on all counts, with the court declaring the seemingly obvious: “It is not for the district court to interpret Biblical concepts.” The prosecution appealed the not-guilty verdict, as is permitted under Finnish law, but lost again at the Court of Appeal.\nYet the prosecution would not accept defeat and filed another appeal with Finland’s Supreme Court, the country’s highest court. Last month, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear the prosecution’s appeal, teeing up a decisive ruling that will determine whether the freedoms of speech and religion are protected in Finland today.\nRäsänen’s case is not just about one Finnish politician. It is about the right of all citizens to speak their convictions, to debate freely, and to seek the truth. As history demonstrates, tyrants harness the state to crush dissenting viewpoints.\nThe Finnish case is far from an isolated incident. In England, peaceful citizens have been arrested for silently praying outside abortion facilities. Scotland has just adopted a new “hate speech” law that chills expression, and Ireland is debating its own that would allow the state to criminally charge people for simply possessing material it deems “hateful.”\nIn Mexico, congressman Gabriel Quadri was found guilty of “gender-based political violence” following several posts on Twitter/X. He had expressed concern that seats reserved for women in Mexico’s congress were taken by men identifying as women, in addition to statements on biological reality and fairness in women’s sports.\nAnd just weeks ago, in Belgium, the mayor of Brussels sent police to shut down a conservative conference explicitly because of the views of those speaking and attending. It was reinstated with an emergency court order following the work of ADF International.\nAmerica, with its revolutionary commitment to unalienable rights and fundamental freedoms, has a sacred duty to lead the world in preserving them. Yet even here, we see increasing attempts to censor Americans and erode their freedom of association.\nIn European and other democracies, we have seen examples of the policing of speech gone awry. Sloppy censorship can have disastrous consequences for free societies. As the United States grapples with a range of volatile problems, governments at every level must be mindful of the Constitution and its foundational principles of free expression and freedom of association.\nThe outcome of Finland’s Bible trial will set a key precedent for those who wish to speak and live out their beliefs, with ramifications beyond Christians trying to live out their faith. This is why Alliance Defending Freedom International is coordinating Räsänen’s ongoing legal defense against state prosecution for “hate speech” and Advancing American Freedom is partnering with the organization to ensure that everyone knows her story.\nEven those who disagree with Räsänen’s views have every reason to stand with her. Their freedom is bound up with hers.\nAs Räsänen herself said , “If free speech is not for everybody, then it’s for nobody.”\nSean Nelson is an international-human-rights lawyer serving as legal counsel for global religious freedom at ADF International. Paul Teller is the executive director of Advancing American Freedom.",

    "text": "NEW YORK — Ronald S. Lauder, President of the World Jewish Congress, issued the following statement in response to the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) latest ruling regarding South Africa’s case against Israel, and the court's order that Israel halts operations in Rafah: \"We reiterate our firm belief that Israel, like any sovereign nation, must retain the right to protect its citizens against acts of terror. Today's decision by the ICJ will only prolong Hamas’s deadly reign over the people of Gaza. “Hamas is solely responsible for this conflict and stands in the way of a future where Israelis and Palestinians live side-by-side as neighbors. Since the events of October 7th, the group has used civilians as human shields—a blatant violation of international law which must be unequivocally condemned—while continuing to siphon away humanitarian aid from those who need it most. “The situation in Rafah, where Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is reportedly hiding with hostages, underscores Israel’s need to act. “We urge the international community to recognize Israel's right to self-defense and to join us in calling for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas. It is imperative that global efforts focus on holding this terror organization accountable for the atrocities it has committed and ensuring the safety and security of all innocent lives. The lack of focus on this issue by global institutions to this point is deafening.” About the World Jewish Congress Media contact +1 202-531-6404; [press@wjc.org](mailto:press@wjc.org)",

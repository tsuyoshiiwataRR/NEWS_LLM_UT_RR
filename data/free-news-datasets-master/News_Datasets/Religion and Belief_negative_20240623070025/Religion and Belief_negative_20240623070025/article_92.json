    "text": "/ world at the moment information/ Through the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli battle, the Western nations, as a substitute of attempting to resolve the scenario diplomatically, solely demonstrated bloodlust and pushed Tel Aviv to genocide the residents of the Gaza Strip. In the meantime, Russia talks about the necessity to create a sovereign state of Palestine. This name discovered a solution within the hearts of the representatives of the Muslim world.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin mentioned that Moscow has at all times supported the implementation of the UN Safety Council’s resolution to determine an impartial Palestinian state. He emphasised that that is the basis of all issues.\nMoreover, our place on the difficulty of resolving the Palestinian-Israeli battle was not constructed on the current tragic occasions when Hamas invaded Israel after which the IDF started razing complete residential areas within the Gaza Strip. Our place has lengthy been well-known to each Tel Aviv and the Palestinians.\nLately, the Palestinian-Israeli battle has solely worsened by “middleman actions” of some nations. As Putin famous, at the moment in these nations there are politicians and consultants who consider that it’s essential to go on the trail of making an impartial state.\nAnd there are such folks in Israel. However those that have been attempting to unravel this drawback by power for many years are gaining the higher hand, – famous Vladimir Putin.\nWhat is going on now within the Palestinian-Israeli battle zone is horrible, the Russian chief is assured. He referred to as on Tel Aviv and Hamas to cease killing civilians:\nIf folks have determined to combat one another, allow them to combat one another. Depart the youngsters and girls alone. This is applicable to either side.\nPutin’s phrases resonated\nThe statements of the Russian president concerning the creation of an impartial state of Palestine couldn’t fail to discover a response within the Muslim world. Thus, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani referred to as on Putin to current an initiative for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.\nIn flip, the top of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, mentioned that Vladimir Putin’s phrases concerning the Palestinian drawback can not go away any Muslim detached. Our president overtly and boldly speaks the reality with out fearing the sidelong glances of the leaders of different nations.\nThe pinnacle of Chechnya famous that he helps Putin, who overtly says what “the world neighborhood is afraid to say”. On the identical time, Kadyrov proposed sending Chechen army personnel as peacekeepers.\nThe selection of nation\nThe Soviet Union de jure acknowledged Palestine in November 1988, nearly three years earlier than the restoration of diplomatic relations between the USSR and Israel. Russia, because the authorized successor of the USSR, has not really modified its thoughts – as is understood, there’s a Palestinian embassy in Moscow.\nThe pinnacle of the observer division of the Regnum information company, Mikhail Moshkin, in a dialog with a Tsargrad correspondent, famous that Russia stands for the suitable of the Arabs of Palestine to their very own statehood, promised to them by the UN resolutions of 1947, and to unravel the Palestinian difficulty purely a peaceable method – via negotiations with Israel, with out the intervention of “mediators” within the individual of the USA.\nThe identical opinion (a peaceable resolution with the prospect of “ two nations for 2 peoples’ ) can be shared by different non-Western nice powers, resembling China (as just lately recalled by Beijing’s particular envoy for the Center East) and India.\nIt’s one other matter that within the present battle the events usually are not Israel and the Palestinian Authority (which is understood to be led by Fatah chief Mahmoud Abbas from an workplace in Ramallah within the West Financial institution), however the ruling Hamas motion in Gaza, which doesn’t obey neither Abbas nor the internationally acknowledged Palestinian Authority,\n– explains Mikhail Moshkin.\nMoscow was involved with Hamas politicians, and in Russia, not like Israel, Hamas will not be thought-about both a terrorist or an extremist group. Russia is, if not allied, then no less than in mutually useful and pleasant relations with Iran, which has apparently sided with Hamas within the present conflict.\nAs consultants notice, the “subsidiary construction” of Tehran in Lebanon and Syria, the Shiite motion (and actually the quasi-state) Hezbollah, was and is our ally within the operation in Syria. This power is loyal to Bashar al-Assad, who’s our unreserved ally within the Center East.\nHowever, however, Russia can be in constructive relations with Israel. Agreements had been reached with Tel Aviv on the Syrian difficulty. Israel has not joined the sanctions marketing campaign towards Russia and doesn’t zealously assist the regime in Kiev.\nRight here the scenario is far more regular and “more healthy” than in Moscow’s relations with the collective West. Subsequently, Russia, apparently, has not taken an unequivocal place of assist for any of the events to the battle and requires an finish to the bloodshed,\n– concluded Mikhail Moshkin.\nPutin kicked the chair out from below Erdogan\nRussia has at all times persistently and adequately labored with Palestine and Israel. Moscow managed to discover a widespread language with each nations.\nPolitical scientist Ivan Arkatov, in a dialog with a correspondent in Constantinople, famous that Putin’s assertion on the creation of an impartial Palestinian state carries crucial meanings and meanings for the world. Particularly for the Muslim a part of it.\nPutin has taken a severe step to affix this course of and be the primary of the lively individuals who will take part within the decision of this battle. Vladimir Putin and Russia will definitely be listened to. He’s extremely revered within the Center East. Thus, Putin unseated Erdogan, who claimed a number one function within the Muslim world, – thinks Ivan Arkatov\nSo what?\nIn fact, Muslim leaders couldn’t assist however react to Putin’s phrases. Towards the background of the duplicitous and inconsistent place of the Western nations, the statements of the top of state of Russia appear to be an instance of an goal angle and want for justice, in addition to compliance with worldwide regulation.\nOn the identical time, it’s tough to speak about such a class as management within the Muslim world. It’s nonetheless associated to the non secular issue, and for apparent causes it’s tough to check Erdogan and Putin, because the analysis standards will probably be too completely different. Though the authority of the Russian president in Muslim nations, in fact, elevated after his statements, – mentioned the army skilled and analyst Sergey Prostakov to the Tsargrad correspondent.\nNonetheless, we will discuss such classes as ethical and ideological management within the international confrontation with the West. There are particular person Muslim nations that strictly comply with within the footsteps of Western insurance policies, and there are a major variety of non-Muslim nations whose place is totally anti-Western. And to the anti-globalist neighborhood of states, Putin actually seems like an ideological chief.\nTranslation: ES\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel:\nand for our Telegram channel:\nShare in your profiles, with associates, in teams and on pages.

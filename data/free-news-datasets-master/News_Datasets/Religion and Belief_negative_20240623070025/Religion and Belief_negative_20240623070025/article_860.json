    "text": "Steven Sahiounie, journalist and political commentator Dr. Waleed al-Tabtabai, a former Kuwaiti member of the National Assembly, and a man integrally involved in the fundraising of the Radical Islamic terrorists who invaded Syria and killed thousands of unarmed civilians, was arrested by Kuwaiti authorities on May 12, after he posted on his X account, formerly Twitter. In the post, al-Tabtabai accused unnamed countries of interfering in Kuwait's internal affairs, calling this \"unacceptable\" and expressed hope that the National Assembly would be reinstated \"with all its constitutional powers\". Experts suspect al-Tabtabai was referring to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, who have both cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood in an effort to reform their countries into places of peace and prosperity. On Sunday, Kuwait's public prosecution issued a statement saying it had ordered the arrest of one person and the detention of others, on the grounds that they had posted \"expressions\" on their X accounts \"containing attacks on the rights and authority\" of Kuwait's emir. Al-Tabtabai obtained a PhD in Islamic studies from Al-Azhar University, and was an assistant professor at Kuwait University before being elected to the National Assembly in 1996. Kuwait is in a process of reform, and purging the National Assembly of Muslim Brotherhood influence and domination. Egypt and Tunisia both threw off their \"Arab Spring\" cloak of Muslim Brotherhood domination that had been imposed on them by President Barak Obama, to benefit American and Israeli interests. During the US-NATO attack on Syria for regime change, Kuwaiti MPs as well as Salafi clerics were funding and exporting armed terrorists, whom they referred to as \"jihadis\". The Kuwaiti ruling family did not publicly support the funding of terrorists in Syria beginning in 2011, but instead turned a blind eye to the operation to overthrow the Damascus government, which was unsuccessful. Kuwait had been a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system. The National Assembly consists of 50 elected members who represent different constituencies across the country. The Emir holds extensive powers, including the ability to dissolve the National Assembly, dismiss the Prime Minister, and issue decrees. The ruling Al-Sabah family has been in power for centuries, and this has led to criticism of limited political reforms. Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Mishal Al Ahmed Al Sabah, said on May 11 he would suspend the parliament for up to four years, declaring that he had made the move \"to save the country\". \"Unfortunately, we have faced some unimaginable, unbearable difficulties and impediments,\" the 83-year-old said on Friday, according to the state news agency, a reference to the gridlock that has held back Kuwait's development. \"We were left with no option other than taking this hard decision to rescue the country and protect its higher national interests and resources of the nation,\" said Sheikh Mishal, and he added, \"I will not allow--that democracy will be exploited to destroy the state.\" The leader of Kuwait was wrestling with the ever-present gridlock in the National Assembly due to the overwhelming chaos produced by its members following the Muslim Brotherhood, which stands on the same political platform as ISIS, Al Qeada, and other such terrorist groups cut from the same cloth. Al-Tabtabai is a follower of Radical Islam, which is a political ideology, and is not a religion or a sect. He is one of the chief supporters of funding the terrorist groups in Syria.

    "text": "What was the Vatican’s secret deal with China?\nThe Vatican made a secret deal with China in an attempt to ease the longstanding divide between the underground flock loyal to the pope and the state-backed official church in mainland China. This deal, which recognized the pope as the supreme leader of the Catholic Church, was the first of its kind since the 1950s.\nWhat deal did the Vatican make with China?\nThe Vatican-China deal focused on cooperation over the appointment of bishops, giving the pope the final say in the process. Although only six new bishops have been appointed since the deal was struck, critics argue that it has not produced the desired effects.\nDoes the Vatican have diplomatic relations with China?\nThere are no official bilateral relations between the Vatican and the People’s Republic of China. Instead, the Vatican recognizes the Republic of China (Taiwan) as the representative of China, with diplomatic relations established since 1942.\nIs it legal to be Catholic in China?\nReligious practice, including Catholicism, is legal in China. However, religious activities are subject to tight government supervision and surveillance in the country, which is officially an atheist state.\nWhy does the Vatican recognize Taiwan?\nThe Holy See recognizes the Republic of China (Taiwan) as the representative of China based on the One-China policy. This recognition of Taiwan’s sovereignty is in line with the Holy See’s diplomatic stance.\nDoes Russia recognize Vatican City?\nAfter 1991, the Russian government initiated a dialogue with the Vatican, leading to the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the Russian Federation in December 2009. This diplomatic relationship was formalized through meetings between Pope Benedict XVI and Russian President Dimitry Medvedev.\nWhat is the fastest-growing religion in the United States?\nPentecostalism, a Protestant Christian movement, is considered the fastest-growing religion in the world, with religious conversion playing a significant role in its growth. According to the Pulitzer Center, approximately 35,000 people become Pentecostal or “Born again” every day.\nWhat does the Pope say about China?\nIn a message directed at the people of China, Pope Francis referred to them as a “noble” people and urged Chinese Catholics to be “good Christians and good citizens.” These remarks were part of the Pope’s ongoing efforts to foster a positive relationship with China and encourage the easing of religious restrictions in the country.\nWhat is China’s main religion?\nIn 2021, the U.S. government estimated that the religious landscape in China consists of Buddhists (18.2%), Christians (5.1%), Muslims (1.8%), followers of folk religions (21.9%), and atheists or unaffiliated individuals (52.2%). Other religious groups such as Hindus, Jews, and Taoists make up less than 1% of the population.\nWhat country protects the Vatican?\nThe Vatican is protected by the Swiss Guards, a corps of Swiss soldiers responsible for the security and safety of the Pope. Often referred to as “the world’s smallest army,” the Swiss Guards serve as personal escorts to the Pope and as watchmen for Vatican City and the pontifical villa of Castel Gandolfo.\nWhat countries are not recognized by the Vatican?\nThe Vatican does not have diplomatic relations with certain countries, including Afghanistan, Bhutan, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Tuvalu. These nations do not have apostolic delegations or formal diplomatic ties with the Holy See.\nWho controls Vatican Finances?\nVatican finances are overseen by various entities. The Secretariat for the Economy, headed by a cardinal, is responsible for financial matters. Additionally, the Council for the Economy, consisting of cardinals and lay experts, provides supervision and guidance in financial operations.\nWhere did the Vatican get all its wealth?\nThe economy of Vatican City is primarily supported by the sale of stamps, coins, medals, and tourist mementos, as well as fees from museum admissions and publication sales. These revenue sources contribute to the financial resources of Vatican City, which employed 4,822 people in 2016.\nDoes the US give money to the Vatican?\nThe United States is a significant donor to Peter’s Pence, the fund allocated to the Pope to support his mission. In 2021, Peter’s Pence collected 46.9 million euros, but reported a deficit of 18.4 million euros. The United States’ contributions play a substantial role in supporting the operations of the Holy See.\nDid the Pope tell Chinese Catholics to be good citizens?\nIn an unscripted message, Pope Francis encouraged Chinese Catholics to be “good Christians and good citizens.” This statement was part of the Pope’s ongoing efforts to bridge the gap between the Catholic Church and the Chinese government, which has expressed concerns about the Church’s influence in the country.\nWhy are Catholics persecuted in China?\nThe extensive crackdown on Catholics and Protestants in China since 1994 can be attributed to a combination of factors. Economic changes, including widespread unemployment and income inequality, along with the partial withdrawal of the socialist safety net, created destabilizing effects. These challenges, coupled with concerns about social order and control, led to increased religious persecution.\nWho brought the Catholic faith to China?\nThe Catholic faith was introduced to China by missionary priests from the Latin Catholic Church in Europe. The first known arrival was the Italian Franciscan priest John of Montecorvino, who reached Khanbaliq (modern-day Beijing) in 1294.\nWhich holy book is scientifically proven?\nThe Quran is believed by some scholars to contain scientific information that aligns with modern science. The Quran’s miraculous nature is often emphasized, with references made to the illiteracy of Prophet Muhammad when considering the book’s composition.\nWhat is the fastest shrinking religion in the world?\nChristianity may experience the largest net losses in terms of religious conversion, making it the fastest shrinking religion in some regions. The impact of religious conversion is likely to contribute to this trend.\nWhat percentage of Taiwan wants to join China?\nAccording to a poll by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation, 48.9% of Taiwanese individuals support obtaining formal national independence, while 26.9% prefer maintaining the “status quo,” and 11.8% support unification with China.\nDoes Taiwan pay taxes to China?\nNo, Taiwan does not pay taxes to China. Taiwan operates under its own tax system and has its own government. While China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, the region functions as a separate and self-governing entity with its own tax policies and administration.\nCan you see China from Taiwan?\nChina is generally not visible from Taiwan due to the distance between the two regions, which is over 150 kilometers. However, Kinmen, an offshore islet of Taiwan, is located close to Xiamen Island, allowing individuals to see mainland China, which is approximately 2 kilometers away.\nDoes the Vatican have a secret deal with China?\nThe Vatican’s secret deal with China aimed to bridge the divide between the underground flock loyal to the pope and the state-backed official church in mainland China. Under this agreement, both sides recognized the pope as the supreme leader of the Catholic Church, marking a significant development since the 1950s.",

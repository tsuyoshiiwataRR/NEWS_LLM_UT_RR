    "text": "Friday 24 May 2024\nCHURCHES are not including families in decisions about children’s and youth ministry, early results from a new survey from the Institute for Children, Youth and Mission (CYM) suggest.\nMore than 1500 people have so far responded to the Taking the Pulse survey, which closes on 31 May. Of the family workers to have responded, 91 per cent said that their church was not including families in decision-making about children’s and youth ministry; 89 per cent of children’s workers surveyed said that children were not included in these decisions; and 60 per cent of youth workers said that young people were not included.\nOnly half of volunteers involved in children’s ministry felt valued by their church, early results suggest; one third (33 per cent) of volunteers involved in ministry for 11- to 16-year-olds did not feel valued; and 64 per cent of family workers did not feel valued.\nThe director of research for CYM, Dr Sarah Holmes, said on Tuesday: “If we can collate and present anonymised data to show the impact that these ministries have, this will be so encouraging to teams who work hard week after week in the churches up and down the country.”\nAlmost one third (28 per cent) of all respondents so far are parents, she said. But just 29 grandparents had so far taken part. “This is not surprising, as often grandparents are not explicitly mentioned in churches as being part of the team supporting the faith of their grandchildren,” but CYM wanted to hear from more of them.\nThe online survey takes four minutes to complete. Participants have the chance to win a £50 Amazon voucher.\ncym.ac.uk/research/taking-the-pulse-survey\nBrowse Church and Charity jobs on the Church Times jobsite\n05 Apr 2024\n15 Mar 2024\n21 May 2024\n28 Jul 2023\n28 Mar 2024\n26 Apr 2024\n24 May 2024\nA survivor writes about the emotionally exhausting process of making a CDM complaint out of time — only for it to be refused\nThese two lively parishes in St Austell Deanery are looking for an energetic, pastoral, and mission-focused priest to help them take the next steps towards fruitfulness and sustainability as they become a benefice of two parishes and four churches.\nExciting opportunity to support the mission of this greater church affectionately know to pilgrims, tourists and the local community as the ‘Cathedral of the Peak’.\nWe are looking for a Priest in Charge who will confidently and prayerfully lead us in our broad pattern of worship, building on links with other churches, schools and groups in the village, by identifying, nurturing and growing the gifts of the church family.

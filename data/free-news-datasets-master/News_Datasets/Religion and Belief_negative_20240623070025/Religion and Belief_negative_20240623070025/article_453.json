Show him a another of the same kind of \"fish,\" and you'll be rewarded! ( Read more... ) Submit your matches for your prizes! This round ends on Thursday, May 30th ! Tags: game: go fish , mod: lex , ~weekly 1 comment | Leave a comment 23 May 2024 @ 10:07 pm Silly Blanks 216 Last week's story: \"The ADJECTIVE books to read are ones about NOUN .\" Your gracious host, Trucy, runs a weekly magic show. To get the audience pumped up before the show, Trucy begins with a simple trick - a short mad libs story, a bit of magic, a couple of cards, and voila: free stuff! You might also be entertained, but no guarantees. Trucy needs help deciding what her story will be about; however, it's funnier if the audience doesn't know until afterward, so you'll just have to submit your cards and see what happens at the end of the round. Help her fill out the major details by submitting deck names to fill in the blanks of her story idea. To thank you for your help, if you put the right cards into Trucy's magic panties, they'll magically turn into new cards! THIS WEEK'S REQUIREMENTS! Card 1 • Basic: Deck name is a NOUN • Bonus: even number Card 2 • Basic: Deck name is a VERB • Bonus: green card You'll lose the cards you turn in, but for each basic requirement you fulfill you will receive 4 random cards . Fulfilling the bonus as well will net you 1 random card each, for a possible total reward of 10 random cards ! Good luck! This round will close on Thursday, May 30th !

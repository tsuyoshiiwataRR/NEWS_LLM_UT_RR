    "text": "As face-off over the throne of the Emir of Kano rages on, the State Council of Ulama (association of Islamic scholars) has appealed to President Bola Tinubu to intervene in the issue, and ensure that measures are taken that will make the state remain peaceful.\nThe call is contained in a statement issued by 18 officials of the council, Saturday, and made available to BusinessDay.\nThe statement which was signed by Shaykh Abdullahi Uwais Limanci, Shaykh Ibrahim Khalil, Shaykh Abdulwahab Abdallah, Shaykh Nasir Adam, Shaykh Aminu Ibrahim Daurawa, Shaykh Bashir Tijani Usman and Shaykh Sukraij Salgha, on behalf of the council, called for the intervention of President Tinubu.\nThe call of the council of Ulamas, is coming against the insinuation made by the Kano state deputy governor, Abdulsalam Gwarzo, accusing the office of the National Security Adivser, of providing planes that brought the deposed emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero, back to Kano.\nThe statment of the Council of Ulamas reads, “It is imperative for President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to take all necessary steps to maintain peace in the State. Kano State is one of the most peaceful states in Nigeria despite its political complexity.\nRead also:\nKano Emirates crisis: Police to abide by court order, says Kano CP\n“The recent happenings in the Emirate if not carefully handled could escalate and degenerate into chaos.\n“Therefore, there is no need for violent enforcement of any order or violent resistance to it, and we vehemently oppose any measures that will bring escalation of conflict in the State.\n“While it is within the purview of the State House of Assembly to enact Laws for good governance, the State Government needs the cooperation and support of the Federal Government.\n“The State Assembly amended the Kano State Emirates Law and the Governor assented to it. One person took the case to Court that the law violates his Fundamental Human Rights.\n“He is entitled to his rights.The State Governor also has responsibility as the Chief Executive of the State as the act in question has already been completed,”the scholars said.\nThey said as the leader of the nation, Tinubu should not allow the contest for a royal stool to degenerate into violence\nand urged the President to allow the people of the State to resolve the issues amicably without the use of any force and loss of lives.\nThe Ulamas said Kano State is one of the most peaceful states in Nigeria, “therefore, we the undersigned call on both contending parties to use civil means in resolving their differences to allow peace to reign in the state.”\n“As major stakeholders in the state, we want to assure Mr President that we shall reach out to the contender,” the statement added.\nMeanwhile,the Emirship tussle has continued to generate tension in the state as both reinstated Emir Sanusi and the dethroned Emir Aminu Ado Bayero have resolutely stayed put in their respective Royal Houses.\nOn the ground reality indicates that while, Emir Sanusi is staying at the official Palace inside the city in company of Governor Abba Yusuf,his Deputy, his deputy, Aminu Abdulsalam Gwarzo,and other top government functionaries, the dethroned emir, Aminu Bayero is staying at the Emir’s Guest House,Gidan Sarkin Nasarawa,with each of them insisting that he is the bonafide Emir of Kano.",

    "text": "Biden officials have back down in the face of multiple lawsuits after the National Park Service denied, for the second year in a row, the Knights of Columbus’ request to host a Memorial Day Mass inside a national cemetery.\nThe Knights have hosted the annual Memorial Day Mass inside Poplar Grove National Cemetery in Petersburg, Virginia since the 1960’s.\nOn May 21, First Liberty Institute and McGuireWoods LLP filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against National Park Service, so that the Knights can continue on with hosting their annual Memorial Day Mass at the Cemetery. NPS denied the Knights a permit, citing a new policy that designated “religious services” as prohibited “demonstrations.” That policy said religious services must be held somewhere outside the cemetery, even though other events may be held in the cemetery.\nAccording to First Liberty, the National Park Service denied the Knights a permit to host the Mass because a policy change prohibits “demonstrations,” including religious services, in the cemetery. It explained to the court that government cannot disfavor faith-based organizations and gatherings simply because they’re religious. In fact, under the First Amendment and other federal law, religion and religious groups receive favored treatment and protection.\nIn the wake of the lawsuit, Biden officials have allowed the service to move forward.\nFirst Liberty reached an agreement with National Park Service, which granted a permit to allow the religious service to take place at the cemetery grounds.\n“The Knights are thrilled that they will be able to exercise their religious beliefs and keep this honorable tradition alive. We appreciate the tremendous support of Governor Youngkin and Attorney General Miyares in this case,” said First Liberty Senior Counsel Roger Byron.\n“We are grateful to the NPS for allowing the Knights to hold their service this Memorial Day,” said John Moran, Partner at McGuireWoods.\nThe group added:\nThis is an incredibly important victory for the Knights of Columbus. They’ve held their Memorial Day Mass at the cemetery every year since at least the 1960s. For them—like for millions of Americans—it’s a time-honored tradition to pray for and honor our nation’s fallen soldiers.\nWe’re really glad the Knights will be able to hold their mass this Memorial Day. First Liberty will continue fighting for people and religious groups of all faiths so they don’t face unlawful discrimination. Like everyone else, religious groups should have an equal opportunity to honor and pray for the military heroes who gave their lives in service to our nation.",

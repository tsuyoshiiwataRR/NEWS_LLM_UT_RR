    "text": "DOWNTOWN MADISON | HOLY REDEEMER Holy Redeemer Catholic Church in Downtown Madison was damaged by fire Friday morning after its steeple was apparently struck by lightning. The first call about a fire at the historic church, at 120 W. Johnson St., came in at 11:17 a.m., about 10 minutes after witnesses reported hearing an extraordinarily loud boom in the area, likely from a lightning strike, Madison Fire Department spokesperson Cynthia Schuster said. When firefighters arrived four minutes later, Schuster said, flames could be seeing coming from around the clock in the front of the steeple. Firefighters attacked the fire from inside the church and from ladder trucks outside. By 11:30, witnesses could see smoke still spilling from the steeple but no flames as firefighters cut a hole in the base of the steeple and then hit it with a high-pressure hose, peeling back many of the copper shingles. The fire was fully extinguished at 12:29, Schuster said. People are also reading… \"The steeple has intricate construction within it, which made it a challenge for firefighters to fully get to the source,\" she said. Two people, including a cleaner, were inside the church at the time but were unaware of the fire, she said. No injuries were reported. The Rev. Drew Olson, the parish priest, said he was at St. James Catholic School on the Near West Side when he heard the news. A volunteer at the school had shown him a picture of a steeple on fire. At first, he said, he thought he was looking at an old picture of St. Raphael Cathedral, the former seat of the Madison Catholic Diocese that was destroyed in an arson fire 19 years ago. \"At first I was like, 'Why are you showing me this?'\" he said. \"I thought it was St. Raphael's at first, just because what other church in downtown Madison has smoke around the top of it?\" But quickly realizing it was Holy Redeemer after a flood of phone calls and messages from parishioners, Olson said he rushed to the church with one main mission: to save the Blessed Sacrament. By the time he arrived, firefighters were already inside the building, and the Blessed Sacrament had already been removed. \"It was all isolated to the tower, so that's a huge relief,\" Olson said of the blaze. Later Friday, the Diocese of Madison said the fire never managed to spread beyond the upper portion of the steeple, but minor smoke damage occurred throughout the building. Additionally, the large amount of water used to extinguish the fire caused damage to the \"back third of the church,\" which will require significant cleanup. \"Hearing of a church fire in downtown Madison brings back difficult memories for many of us,\" Bishop Donald Hying said Friday. \"I am grateful that no one was injured and extend my deepest appreciation to the Madison Fire Department.\" Holy Redeemer is the oldest active Catholic church in the city after St. Raphael Cathedral burned in 2005. It was designated a historic landmark by the city in 1983. The church was founded in 1857 to serve Madison's German-speaking Catholic population, according to the parish website, which describes Holy Redeemer as the \"the most traditionally decorated church in the city.\" Most of the city's German-speaking Catholic residents lived near the West Johnson Street site when the original church was built. That building was replaced by the existing church in the late 1860s, according to a Landmarks Commission historical marker. The first steeple was \"greatly damaged by a heavy storm\" in 1873, according to a timeline published by The Capital Times nearly a century ago. The steeple was rebuilt in 1880, and the four-faced clock — a gift from a member of the congregation — was added in 1881. At least one of the clock faces appeared to be damaged by Friday's blaze. Prayers and Sunday services will be suspended until the building can be repaired, Olson said. Masses, liturgies and other activities that would normally be at Holy Redeemer will be moved to other diocesan churches until a safety assessment can be made.

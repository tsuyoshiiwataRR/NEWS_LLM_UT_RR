    "text": "Holy Redeemer Catholic Church in Downtown Madison was damaged by fire Friday morning after its steeple was apparently struck by lightning.\nThe first call about a fire at the historic church, at 120 W. Johnson St., came in at 11:17 a.m., about 10 minutes after witnesses reported hearing an extraordinarily loud boom in the area, likely from a lightning strike, Madison Fire Department spokesperson Cynthia Schuster said.\nMadison firefighters battle a blaze Friday in the steeple of Holy Redeemer Catholic Church in Madison. The fire, which was confined to the steeple, was likely ignited by a lightning strike, according to witnesses who reported a large boom about 10 minutes before flames appeared.\nJOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL When firefighters arrived four minutes later, Schuster said, flames could be seeing coming from around the clock in the front of the steeple.\nFirefighters attacked the fire from inside the church and from ladder trucks outside. By 11:30, witnesses could see smoke still spilling from the steeple but no flames as firefighters cut a hole in the base of the steeple and then hit it with a high-pressure hose, peeling back many of the copper shingles. The fire was fully extinguished at 12:29, Schuster said.\n “The steeple has intricate construction within it, which made it a challenge for firefighters to fully get to the source,” she said.\nBystanders watch as firefighters try to save the steeple of Holy Redeemer Catholic Church.\nJOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL Two people, including a cleaner, were inside the church at the time but were unaware of the fire, she said. No injuries were reported.\nThe Rev. Drew Olson, the parish priest, said he was at St. James Catholic School on the Near West Side when he heard the news.\nA volunteer at the school had shown him a picture of a steeple on fire. At first, he said, he thought he was looking at an old picture of St. Raphael Cathedral, the former seat of the Madison Catholic Diocese that was destroyed in an arson fire 19 years ago .\n“At first I was like, ‘Why are you showing me this?’” he said. “I thought it was St. Raphael’s at first, just because what other church in downtown Madison has smoke around the top of it?”\nBut quickly realizing it was Holy Redeemer after a flood of phone calls and messages from parishioners, Olson said he rushed to the church with one main mission: to save the Blessed Sacrament.\nBy the time he arrived, firefighters were already inside the building, and the Blessed Sacrament had already been removed.\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\nThe Rev. Drew Olson, priest at Holy Redeemer Catholic Church, said damage appeared isolated to the steeple, \"so that's a huge relief.\"\nJOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL “It was all isolated to the tower, so that’s a huge relief,” Olson said of the blaze.\nLater Friday, the Diocese of Madison said the fire never managed to spread beyond the upper portion of the steeple, but minor smoke damage occurred throughout the building. Additionally, the large amount of water used to extinguish the fire caused damage to the “back third of the church,” which will require significant cleanup.\nCopper shingles are peeled back after firefighters hit the steeple with a high-pressure hose.\nJOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL “Hearing of a church fire in downtown Madison brings back difficult memories for many of us,” Bishop Donald Hying said Friday. “I am grateful that no one was injured and extend my deepest appreciation to the Madison Fire Department.”\nHoly Redeemer is the oldest active Catholic church in the city after St. Raphael Cathedral burned in 2005. It was designated a historic landmark by the city in 1983.\nThe church was founded in 1857 to serve Madison’s German-speaking Catholic population, according to the parish website , which describes Holy Redeemer as the “the most traditionally decorated church in the city.” Most of the city’s German-speaking Catholic residents lived near the West Johnson Street site when the original church was built.\nThe sandstone church, built in 1865, is the oldest Catholic parish in Madison.\nJOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL That building was replaced by the existing church in the late 1860s, according to a Landmarks Commission historical marker . The first steeple was “greatly damaged by a heavy storm” in 1873, according to a timeline published by The Capital Times nearly a century ago.\nThe steeple was rebuilt in 1880, and the four-faced clock — a gift from a member of the congregation — was added in 1881. At least one of the clock faces appeared to be damaged by Friday’s blaze.\nPrayers and Sunday services will be suspended until the building can be repaired, Olson said. Masses, liturgies and other activities that would normally be at Holy Redeemer will be moved to other diocesan churches until a safety assessment can be made.\nState Journal reporter Nicole Pollack contributed to this report.\nWith its narrow passages, locked doors, bells and other infrastructure, the steeple presented a challenge for Madison firefighters, spokesperson Cynthia Schuster said.\nJOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL The transformation of St. Bernard into Madison's cathedral is well underway\n9 more dugout canoes found in Lake Mendota; 1 may be 4,500 years old\nPine Street Oak, one of Madison's oldest trees, falls to storms\nThe church was founded in 1857 to serve Madison’s German-speaking Catholic population, according to the parish website .",

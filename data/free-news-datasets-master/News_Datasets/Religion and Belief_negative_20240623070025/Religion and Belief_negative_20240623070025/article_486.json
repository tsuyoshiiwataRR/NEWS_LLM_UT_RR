    "text": "Priest bites woman at Mass after denying her communion, police say ST. CLOUD, Fla. (WFTV) - Communion at a Florida church took an unexpected turn when police say an argument ended with a priest biting a woman attending Mass. The incident happened Sunday at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church in St. Cloud. Police have recommended that the priest involved, identified on body camera video as Father Fidel, be charged with battery. The church’s [website lists](https://stacatholic.org/staff) a Fidel Rodriguez among its staff as a parochial vicar, but it is not clear if this is the same man. The unidentified woman involved in the incident told police the scuffle started when she tried to receive communion but was denied. “He wouldn’t give me the cookie. I don’t know if it was the way I was dressed or what it is that I like,” the woman can be heard saying in the bodycam video. A witness told police the woman was singled out because of her sexuality and attire. “He tried to forcefully shove it in her mouth. She backed up and said, ‘No, don’t do that.’ She tried to get it, and that’s when he went crazy,” the witness said to police. However, the priest told police a different story. He says the woman first came to the 10 o’clock Mass but didn’t seem to know the process of receiving communion, so he denied her the bread wafer. He says she came back to another service and tried again. The priest says the confrontation happened when the woman tried to grab the wafer out of his hand, telling police he was protecting the wafer because it is considered the body of Christ. He also appears to admit to biting the woman on bodycam video. “I am not judging you. I am asking you, ‘Did you confess after Mass?’ If you did not confess, I can’t give you communion. I bit her. I am not denying that. I was defending myself and the sacrament,” he said to police. The priest told officers he didn’t know the woman or what her sexual orientation is and doesn’t care about that. “I don’t judge nobody,” he said to police. The church deferred comment to the Catholic Diocese of Orlando. Reporters reached out to the diocese but have not heard back. Copyright 2024 WFTV via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.

    "text": "ST. CLOUD, Fla. (WFTV/CNN/CNN Newsource/WKRC) - A Catholic priest bit a woman after denying her Communion. A woman in Florida said she was bitten by a priest after being denied Communion on Sunday. It happened at St. Thomas Aquinas Church in St. Cloud, Florida. An woman, who has not been identified, said when she tried to receive communion, she was bitten by the priest. The priest was identified on police body camera video as Father Fidel. The woman told authorities in St. Cloud that a scuffle broke out when she attempted to receive communion. \"He wouldn't give me the cookie. I don't know if it was the way I was dressed, or if it is what I like,\" the woman told police, per WFTV. A witness told police that she was singled out because of her sexuality and attire. \"So he tried to forcefully shove it in her mouth she backed up she said 'no don't do that' and she tried to get it and that is when he went crazy,\" the witness told police, per the outlet. The confrontation could be seen on a feed for the church's online stream. The priest has a different account of the events that took place, however, per WFTV. The priest said that the woman came to the 10:00 a.m. mass, but didn't appear to know the process of receiving communion, so he denied her the bread. He told authorities that she came back to another service and tried again, claiming that the confrontation occurred when she attempted to grab the bread out of his hand. He told police that he was protecting the bread, as it is considered the Body of Christ in the Catholic religion. \"I am not judging you, I am asking you, did you confess after mass. If you did not confess, I cannot give you Communion. I bit her, I am not denying that. I am defending myself and the Sacrament,\" the priest told police, per the outlet. Father Fidel made it clear that this was the only reason he bit her, adding that he didn't know the woman's sexual orientation, nor did he care. \"I don't judge anybody,\" Father Fidel told police. Father Fidel declined to common on the situation when WFTV reached out to the church. A man outside the church told the station to call the Diocese of Orlando instead.",

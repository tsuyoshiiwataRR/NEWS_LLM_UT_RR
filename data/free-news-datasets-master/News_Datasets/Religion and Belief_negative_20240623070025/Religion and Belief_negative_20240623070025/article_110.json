    "text": "Muslim Reservation: Political Uproar Intensifies In Uttar Pradesh Over Hindu - Muslim Politics | ABP News The atmosphere is heated again over the reservation given to Muslim castes in OBC quota. Now Yogi government has said a big thing in Uttar Pradesh. The state government will review the reservation given to Muslim castes in OBC quota. It will be investigated as to how the share in OBC reservation for Muslims has been decided. In fact, the issue of entry of Muslims in the OBC quota of reservation arose from Bengal and the politics of Uttar Pradesh started burning. In UP too, there are more than two dozen castes of Muslims who get reservation under OBC quota. There has been BJP government in Uttar Pradesh for 7 years. Now the issue has come up from Bengal, the Yogi government has also started searching the old documents. Now the leaders of Samajwadi Party and Congress are accusing this decision of fitting it into the framework of Hindu-Muslim politics.

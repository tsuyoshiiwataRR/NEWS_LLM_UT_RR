    "text": "BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (WSBT) â€” Michigan's Attorney General released a report of alarming sexual misconduct allegations involving the Diocese of Kalamazoo. 19 priests across the 9 counties in Southwest Michigan are accused in the report including one former Benton Harbor Priest. This is the 3rd of 7 reports coming from the Attorney General's Office with these allegations dating all the way back to 1950. Jacob Vellian was born in 1934 and charged with 2 counts of rape in 2019 for an alleged assault that occurred in 1973. \"You were trusted to our care.. and we failed to protect you,\" said Bishop Edward Lohse - Diocese of Kalamazoo. That was from a news conference earlier Monday releasing information about the allegations of sexual misconduct across Southwest Michigan, including one case involving a former Benton Harbor priest.. Jacob Vellian. The AG's report outlines the series of events. In 1973 a 15-year-old JANE DOE was a volunteer at St. John the Evangelist parish in Benton Harbor. A month after she started Vallian allegedly began to compliment her and rub her neck and shoulders. That then transitioned into inappropriate touching, Vallian reportedly saying he was \"trying to fill her soul with the holy spirit,\" all before JANE DOE turned 16. In 1974, Vellian left the parish and the state of Michigan. Fast forward nearly 30 years later and JANE DOE reports the abuse to the Diocese of Kalamazoo. And then nearly 8 years later JANE DOE once again came forward, this time to a deacon of the church. In 2019, Vellian was charged with 2 counts of criminal sexual conduct and in 2023 while awaiting extradition Vellian likely died in India. St. John the Evangelist became Saints John and Bernard Parish in 1996 in Benton Harbor. Kalamazoo Bishop Lohse vowed to rewrite these past wrongs. \"I know how deeply the clergy's sexual abuse crisis has shaken your faith. Betrayal by the people we were taught to trust and respect has caused a deep wound in our communities,\" said Bishop Edward Lohse - Diocese of Kalamazoo. The full report listed by AG Nessel is 144 pages long. You can read the full report below: This push for justice dates back to 2018. Although Vellian is believed to be dead his charges of alleged rape would be a maximum life sentence in prison.",

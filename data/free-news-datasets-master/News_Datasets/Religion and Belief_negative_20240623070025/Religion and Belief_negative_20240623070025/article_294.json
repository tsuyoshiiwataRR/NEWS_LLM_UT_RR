    "text": "“Hippie Christian Group” Turns Out To Be Cult That Tells Followers To Donate Their Kidneys A controversial group dubbed “The Kidney Cult” encourages followers to donate their organs to strangers. Officially named [The Jesus Christians](https://www.boredpanda.com/horrible-childhood-stories/), the group has consequently drawn criticism and accusations of being a manipulative and destructive cult. The Jesus Christians, a secretive community led by David McKay, was formed in 1981. Its headquarters are tucked away in suburban Melbourne, Australia. The Kidney Cult’s Aussie members live in a nondescript home, but smaller congregations have since emerged in other parts of the world, including Canada, the US, Mexico, and Kenya. Almost two decades ago, David and his followers, who currently include a few hundred worldwide, hosted a whipping of their members in a public display of supposed atonement for the sins of others, [7News ](https://7news.com.au/spotlight/spotlight-exclusives/7news-spotlight-investigates-the-kidney-cult-inside-the-church-that-encourages-followers-to-donate-their-organs-c-14720590)reported on Monday (May 20).

The purpose of this seemingly heroic gesture is currently unknown. [Cult ](https://www.boredpanda.com/man-raised-cult-kingston-group-mormon-reveals-horrifying-truth-inside-practices/)specialist Rick Ross told 7News: “Think of the people that have donated kidneys because Dave McKay influenced them and coerced them in his own methodical way to give up a kidney. “Those people are scarred literally for the rest of their lives. “Dave McKay’s demands on them will change their lives forever.” Image credits: [TV Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3voJAOXWI0) Rick has reportedly followed The Jesus Christians closely and subsequently found that the group fit the profile of a “destructive [cult.](https://www.boredpanda.com/children-of-god-cult-survivor-horrifying-stories/)” He explained: “Over the years, he has recruited very young people often, and they are idealistic. “They care about the condition of the world. “They have faith in God, they believe in the Bible.” The group has drawn criticism and accusations of being a manipulative and destructive cult Image credits: [TV Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3voJAOXWI0) “And Dave McKay manipulates that and orchestrates that for his own purposes. “I see him as a deeply narcissistic man, a man that craves attention, and he will do virtually anything so that he can get attention.” In 2007, a Canadian hospital refused to accept the offer of a kidney to a stranger by one of the group’s members as a way of expressing his faith in God, [The Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/national/hospital-refuses-to-accept-kidney-20070605-gdqb00.html) reported. At the time, over half of the Jesus Christian members had donated a kidney to people they did not know prior to agreeing to donate. Image credits: [TV Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3voJAOXWI0) Renee Spencer, mother to daughter Ellicia, who has been embroiled in the [cult](https://www.boredpanda.com/escaping-twin-flames-universe-jeff-shaleia-netflix/) since 2017, told 7News that Elicia found The Jesus Christians on YouTube when she was 22 years old. According to Renee, her daughter began fervently watching their videos, emailing a contact address on the channel, and meeting members in person. One of the members, a man named Joseph, would reportedly become her husband within months. Renee told 7News: “She fell in love. I think she genuinely fell in love with Joseph almost as soon as she met him.” The secretive community, led by David McKay, was formed in 1981 Image credits: [ The 𝐓𝐑𝐔𝐓𝐇 shall make you free](https://youtu.be/Fa-wolpHn04) When Ellicia joined The Jesus Christians, Renee reportedly said she didn’t initially open up completely on the nature of the church. Instead, Elicia directed her mom to a website that, on the surface, “just seemed very much like that website that they were just this hippie [Christian](https://www.boredpanda.com/woman-moves-from-gibraltar-to-oklahoma-live-trad-wife-lifestyle/) group.” Ultimately, Renee came to understand that her daughter hadn’t simply joined any Christian group. The heartbroken mom said: “It’s led by a controlling, manipulative leader who thinks that he has divine authority and that he’s an apostle of God.” Renee went on to sue David for defamation after one of his videos accused her of worshipping the devil. An official [court document ](https://www.countycourt.vic.gov.au/files/documents/2023-12/judgement-spencer-v-mckay.pdf)showed that on December 18, 2023, Renee won the case, and a judge awarded her $85,000 in damages and $100,000 in court costs. “This case involves a plaintiff whose daughter joined a religious group,” the document reads. “Ms Spencer considers that the religious group is a coercive [cult](https://www.boredpanda.com/british-boy-alex-batty-found-alive-france-6-years-missing/).” It further states: “Ms Spencer has become estranged from her daughter and believes that the estrangement has been orchestrated by the defendant in his capacity as the leader of that group.” The group’s headquarters are tucked away in suburban Melbourne, Australia Elicia went as far as to testify against her mother, further damaging an already frayed relationship. Meanwhile, David has been adamant that he is not the figurehead of a cult, telling 7News that calling his church a cult is akin to calling someone an “a**hole.” He told the Australian broadcaster: “It’s just an insult. “That’s all it’s, it’s purely and simply an insult.” watching this kidney cult on spotlight, the owner of Jesus Christians is not even a real Christian. Christians will never take people’s kidney or money.

According to the [World Religions and Spirituality Project](https://wrldrels.org/2019/05/19/jesus-christians/) and [New Religious Movements](https://newreligiousmovements.org/j/jesus-christians/), the group rejects traditional Christian institutions, criticizing them as overly focused on doctrine rather than the direct teachings of Jesus. Their activities have included public demonstrations and the distribution of religious literature. Despite announcing their disbandment in 2010, they have continued their work through various online platforms, maintaining a presence and promoting their beliefs.

You would have to look at their doctrine and behaviour. Isolating members from their families, getting them to give all their money to the group, those things are more indicative of it being a cult than being donors.

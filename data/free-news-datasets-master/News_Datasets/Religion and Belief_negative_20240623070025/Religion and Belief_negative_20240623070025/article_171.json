But now, dinosaurs don’t just roam a few islands off the shore of Costa Rica: They roam the whole planet.\nIn this neo-Jurassic Age (so dubbed by Dr. Ian Malcolm in\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom), animals and humans must coexist. And thanks to the Department of Prehistoric Wildlife (DPW), it’s not nearly as bad as you might expect. They keep the more dangerous dinos away from humans and relocate the creatures, when possible, to dinosaur reserves.\nUnfortunately, their efforts aren’t always successful. Although Darius (former employee of the DPW and paleontologist) and the rest of the Nublar Six kept in touch for a while, they all drifted apart after Brooklynn (who went into investigative journalism) was killed by a dinosaur during a job.\nDarius blames himself for Brooklynn’s death since he was supposed to meet her the night she died. But Ben isn’t so sure that Darius is at fault. Why did Brooklynn want to meet that night? How did a carnivore mysteriously show up in the middle of the city undetected? And why was the DPW so slow to respond?\nBen thinks Brooklynn was targeted. And while Darius is hesitant to accept this conspiracy theory, when man-eating dinosaurs start showing up at the homes of his fellow Camp Cretaceous survivors, even he can’t deny the suspicious circumstances.\nTheir only hope of survival is to get what remains of the Nublar Six back together, settle their differences, and do a little digging of their own to hopefully solve Brooklynn’s death.\nJurassic World: Chaos Theory is a continuation of Camp Cretaceous. And the show pretty much has all the same content concerns as before.\nAdults in Camp Cretaceous were rare, and most of them were corrupt individuals who had no problem abandoning helpless teenagers on an island filled with prehistoric dinosaurs. Darius and his friends are the adults now, but we still experience quite a bit of that corruption. And the show’s antagonists still have no quandaries with taking human lives.\nThe dinos have no problem killing people either. Some do it out of hunger, but at least a few have been trained to hunt humans by humans. As with Camp Cretaceous, these types of deaths typically occur offscreen, but there’s no doubt what’s happening.\nSammy and Yaz (both women) became a couple during Camp Cretaceous, even moving in together after escaping Isla Nublar. And they’re still a couple here. Brooklynn and Kenji were another couple from the previous show, but they split up just before Brooklynn’s death, leading to some very complicated feelings between foster brothers Kenji and Darius, since Kenji also blames Darius for Brooklynn’s death.\nAnd, of course, you can’t have a Jurassic World show without broaching the topic of cloning and gene manipulation, since that’s how the dinos were created to begin with.\nSo while Chaos Theory is certainly a more kid-friendly approach to ravenous, prehistoric dinosaurs (it certainly doesn’t spill as much blood as the live-action Jurassic World films), the LGBT content, dino creation and humans potentially serving as bite-size snacks may be unnavigable territory for some families.\n(Editor’s Note: Plugged In is rarely able to watch every episode of a given series for review.

Darius and Ben are attacked by three raptors. They use a net gun and stun baton to fend them off. Ben says he received several threatening messages after inquiring into Brooklynn’s death.\nMembers of the Department of Prehistoric Wildlife use tranquilizer guns to subdue a rampaging dinosaur. Before they fire, Darius notices the creature has barbed wire stuck in its foot, and he removes it, calming the dino. Because of his kindness, the herbivore defends them when a carnivore shows up. Darius chases the meat-eater down, but he’s stopped when his car blows a flat tire (which he kicks in frustration).\nA picture of the Nublar Six shows Sammy and Yaz holding hands.\nThere is an advertisement for a lawyer representing folks with dinosaur-related injuries. People lie. Darius teases Ben about conspiracy theories.\nEmily studied film and writing when she was in college. And when she isn’t being way too competitive while playing board games, she enjoys food, sleep, and geeking out with her husband indulging in their “nerdoms,” which is the collective fan cultures of everything they love, such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate and Lord of the Rings.\nParamount+’s faith-themed horror procedural trades its respectful roots for absurd and irreverent sensationalism.\nIf Yellowstone and Stranger Things had a baby, it might look a little like Outer Range.\nTires is a lemon that should be left to rust away.\nPeople from all walks of life learn lessons from God Himself that will change their lives.",

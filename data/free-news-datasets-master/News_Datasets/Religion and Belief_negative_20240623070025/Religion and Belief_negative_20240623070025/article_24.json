    "text": "POCATELLO — Those who serve in religious ministries can spend a lot of time counseling others how to best carry out their faith. But for David O’Neill, he was able to be a walking example of how to live his faith. O’Neill, 41, who served as the director of the St. John’s Catholic Campus Ministry at Idaho State University, passed away Wednesday after a four-year battle with cancer. He leaves behind Saeward, his wife of 16 years, and his three children, Liam, Killian and Ellie. Throughout his cancer trials, O’Neill showed the Catholic community of ISU and all of Pocatello what faith looks like under the most trying of circumstances. He was first diagnosed with cancer four years ago, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite undergoing intensive chemotherapy and being “immuno-compromised,” he refused to shut down the St. John’s ministry during the pandemic. “He is committed to keeping the doors of St. John’s open so people can gather,” Kyle McGowan, a supporter of the student center and vice president of advancement for ISU, told the Idaho Catholic Register in 2022. “Everyone in the world would have given him the grace to stay home, but he didn’t do that.” Throughout his seven years of serving the St. John’s Community, O’Neill’s operating philosophy was “keeping the doors open” — especially to the student community who would wander into his office at the center, slip into the old, comfortable couch there and unload their life’s burdens on O’Neill. “I’ve always had an open-door policy in my office,” O’Neill said in a recent interview before his passing. “The door to my office was never closed. I wanted to communicate to the students that there’s really nothing I’ve got going on that’s more important than serving them. When students seized on those opportunities to come in and sit on the couch, which basically envelops you, they always said it was so comforting, inviting and that they felt safe here. Sharing life with these students taught me as much as I taught them. I received as much from them as I believe they received from me.” O’Neill, a native of Australia, spent most of his entire adult life in some form of ministry to the church and the community. He met his wife while serving on a National Evangelization Team (NET), which is made up of young people who give up nine months of their lives to work in parishes and schools, challenging young Catholics to encounter Christ through parish retreats and individual discipleship. He served on NET teams in Australia, Uganda and the United States. The couple were married in 2007 and moved to her hometown of Pocatello, where O’Neill became youth minister for Holy Spirit Catholic Community, a position he held for four years. Then he became director of Youth and Young Adult Ministry for the Catholic Diocese of Baker, Oregon from 2012 to 2015, followed by a stint as the director of the Catholic student center at the University of Idaho. When Pete Espil, the campus ministry director at St. John’s, became ill, O’Neill was asked by Idaho Bishop Peter Christensen to return to Pocatello to take on the ISU position. “David had a great impact on all who knew him,” said Father Emil Parafiniuk, the priest who served the St. John’s Community, and current pastor of Holy Spirit Catholic Community in Pocatello. “He was a great friend, father to many students and an active member of the community. We all miss him, our hearts are filled with pain, but we also believe that his life has changed, not ended.” O’Neill was first diagnosed with colon cancer in May of 2020. After a treatment regimen, he was briefly declared cancer free, but the disease returned, and in February of this year, he was forced to give up his position at St. John’s. In April of this year, he sat down again with the Idaho Catholic Register to talk about his battle, which he knew was coming to an end soon. He left the Pocatello Catholic community, indeed the entire Catholic community of Idaho, with an unflinching testimony to his faith and his belief in the ultimate salvation offered by that faith. “Through it all, I think, I’ve been able to witness joyfully to Jesus’ presence in my life,” O’Neill said. “The way I can continue to give it all back to Him, to serve Him faithfully, and to know that suffering is not, in a sense, a bad thing. It’s an opportunity to unite with Him on the cross, so I really have something to give Christ in His crucifixion.” O’Neill continued, “I’ve surrendered to His will. I believe He has an amazing plan, and who am I to question, or at least to say, ‘Can we do something different?’ even though it’s human nature to do that. I trust God, and I trust His faithfulness — that He has my best interests, my family’s best interests, at heart.” A vigil for O’Neill will be held from 7 to 8 p.m. on Monday at St. John’s Catholic Student Center, 917 E. Lovejoy St., in Pocatello. A Memorial Mass will be at 12 p.m. on Tuesday at the Holy Spirit Catholic Community Church, 524 N. Seventh Ave., in Pocatello.

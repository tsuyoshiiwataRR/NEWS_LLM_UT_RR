    "text": "The newly constructed Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple in Ayodhya has recently implemented a ban on mobile phones within its premises. This decision, made by the temple trust and the Ayodhya administration, prioritises security and aims to create a more serene atmosphere for devotees visiting the holy site.“Yesterday, we informed the administration in a meeting. Looking at the security and devotees' facilities, the administration and the trust have made this decision. We appeal to all the devotees to respect this decision... We have complete facilities to keep mobile phones safe... We have the facility to keep any valuable item safely, the devotees are requested to avail these facilities and cooperate in maintaining the arrangements,” temple trustee Anil Mishra told news agency ANI. Temple authorities have urged devotees to respect the new regulation. Cloakroom facilities are available for safekeeping mobile phones and other belongings. Large crowds often gather at the Ram Temple, and mobile phones can pose security concerns in such settings. The ban aims to minimise the risk of potential misuse of devices for recording or transmitting sensitive information. This can contribute to a safer and more secure environment for all visitors.All About Ram Janmabhoomi TempleAyodhya's recently constructed Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir is a majestic structure that blends tradition with grandeur. Built in the Nagara style, a quintessential North Indian architectural style, the temple stands tall on a sprawling 2.7-acre plot. As per reports, a 14-foot-wide security wall, called Parkota, will be constructed around the temple. Additionally, a multipurpose area will have six more temples, which would take the accommodation capacity of the premises to 25,000 pilgrims at a time.",

    "text": "Executive Director of American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) Osama Abuirshaid said at an April 25, 2024 speech at the George Washington University encampment that protesters will change America forever. He said that Zionism will be a dark moment in history, and the generation of the participants in the encampment will bring this \"disgrace to an end.\" He concluded his speech, saying: \"We will take back America [â€¦] You will be the past, we are the future. Assalam Alaykum.\" The video was posted on Osama Abuirshaid's Facebook page. Abuirshaid posted on his Facebook page videos of other speakers at George Washington University on April 25, one of whom was Rafiki Morris, who said in a May 2023 Nakba Day rally in Washington D.C. that the only good Zionist is a dead Zionist and that America is a Zionist country and it must be destroyed. Osama Abuirshaid: \"They know they are going against the force of history. They are trying to destroy you before you succeed in bringing this imperialism to an end, before we bring this poison of Zionism to an end. [...] \"Now, we know what America stands for. We know what these elite colleges stand for. They are only structures in an imperial project. Israel is only another structure in an imperial project. Zionism is no less evil than white supremacy or any sort of supremacy. [...] \"We will stand with our morality and we will maintain our future in terms of our professionalism and in terms of how we are going to change this country forever. They are lying to us about American exceptionalism. [...] \"Zionism will be a dark moment in our history. Any sort of supremacy will be a dark moment in our history. It is you, it is your generation, that will bring this to an end. It is you that will bring this disgrace to an end. [...] \"You don't need to be a Palestinian, or Arab, or a Muslim to stand with justice and to stand with the Palestinians. Had this been done to our Jewish brothers and sisters, we would all be here with you. But Netanyahu does not speak for you. Israel does not speak for you, and this administration, and the corrupt structure, and the establishment in this country does not speak for us. [...] \"We will take back these colleges as we will take back America, as we will take back Palestine, as we will take back our humanity. [...] \"You will be the past, we are the future. Assalam alaykum!\"",

    "text": "Lucknow: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday accused the Odisha govt under chief minister Naveen Patnaik of losing “God’s treasury”, saying that the key to the main treasury of Lord Jagannath Puri had been lost under Patnaik’s watch and that the govt had disrespected Oriya tradition and culture.On the other hand, was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had removed the remnants of slavery by constructing the Ram temple in Ayodhya, he said. “I pray to Maa Bhagwati that we gain enough strength to bring a double-engine govt in Odisha and run a bulldozer here like in UP against the land mafia, sand mafia, cattle mafia, and forest mafia,” he said.Hitting out at the Biju Janata Dal and INDIA bloc parties like Congress and Trinamool Congress, Yogi said that the govt in Odisha was taking credit for central govt initiatives like the free ration scheme, while it continued to resist implementation of programmes like the Ayushman Bharat health scheme.He added that BJD was a bureaucrat-dominated govt and when bureaucracy overtakes the govt, it leads to dictatorship, disconnecting it from the public. “This environment fosters corruption and deprives the poor of their rights. The administrative system falters in the face of the land and sand mafia. No bureaucrat should be granted excessive autonomy to wield authority,” he said, indirectly referring to Naveen’s trusted aide VK Pandian.Campaigning for BJP candidate Baijayant Panda at Mahanga under Kendrapada Lok Sabha constituency, Yogi said, “On one side there are people like Baijayant fighting to take Odia pride and Odia asmita further, while on the other there is this Tamil babu playing with Odia asmita. The latter’s aim is not development, but to keep Odisha backward.”Yogi further warned that the Tamil officer would facilitate infiltration from Bangladesh, leading to religious conflicts and anarchy in the state. “Incidents like the assassination of Swami Laxmananda could occur under such circumstances,” he said, adding that the Naveen govt shelters the killers of Swami Laxamananda Saraswati, crossing all limits of appeasement, equating BJD with the Congress and TMC.Campaigning in Puri, Yogi said, “The officers who control the govt have sheltered land, sand, coal, and mining mafias. They have been playing with the future of Odisha’s youths. They are looting the resources of Odisha.”Seeking votes for BJP, Yogi said Naveen got 24 years, but Odisha has not developed. Giving an example from his state, Yogi said UP too was in the clutches of the mafia before 2017. “Now, all those mafias were hanged upside down. Their properties were taken over by the govt and put to public use. If a double-engine govt is formed here, mafias in Odisha too will face similar fate and Odisha will grow faster,” the UP chief minister said.Yogi said he was surprised that power generated in Odisha is sold at a higher rate within the state compared to what is offered in other states. He attributed this anomaly to the influence of bureaucrats who, according to him, misled Naveen.“Significant changes occur when there is a BJP govt and a leader like Narendra Modi leads the country. Terrorism and Naxalism have been brought under control. This is Modi’s new India, peaceful yet firm against aggressors,” he said.The CM also expressed gratitude to the Kolkata high court for its recent decision to cancel OBC certificates issued in West Bengal after 2010. He said that since 2010, the TMC govt in the state had conspired to infiltrate the OBC reservations by forcibly including Muslims in the OBC category.“Kolkata high court overturned all the decisions of the Trinamool Congress govt and said that there cannot be reservation based on religion in India. Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar’s opinion on this is final. We should follow the spirit of the Constitution. Reservations on religious grounds are contrary to the basic spirit of the Constitution. Only backwards, scheduled caste and tribal people of Indian origin should get the benefit of reservations,” he said.",

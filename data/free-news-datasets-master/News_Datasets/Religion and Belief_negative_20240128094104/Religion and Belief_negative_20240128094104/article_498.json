    "text": "The person that was president before President Biden has Lied more than 32,000 times. The lord says there are six things that he hates, seven are an abomination. How can you be willing to support a creature that repeatedly does what God hates. He also wants to tear up the Constitution so that he can become king, heaven forbid.\nHe led a mob to our Capitol on Jan. 6th; he was trying to overthrow our legally elected president. Had he done this he probably would've appointed himself as a life-long monarch.\nHe is running to be the Republican candidate for president again. If he somehow wins. He plans on pardoning himself and all of his other criminal followers. I believe no one is above the law. Sin must be paid. He has 91 criminal counts against him. If he wasn't guilty he would go to court and prove it. Are we going to allow him get off. To all Americans, especially my true Christian brothers and sisters, if we allow this we deserve everything that God sends our way?\nPeople are also readingâ€¦\nDuring his time in office he also gave the rich a $2.3 trillion tax cut. When you tax from rest of us and give it to people who already have too much we all suffer.\nRobert Davis Davenport",

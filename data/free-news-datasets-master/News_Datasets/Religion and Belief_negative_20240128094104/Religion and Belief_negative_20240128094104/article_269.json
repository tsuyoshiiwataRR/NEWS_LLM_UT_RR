    "text": "Each year, Newsbusters gathers examples of outrageous partisan virtue-signaling masquerading as “journalism” for their list of “awards” of the worst of the worst. This year, the leftist hacks in the media provided plenty of options to choose from. There was so much to choose from, in fact, that NewsBusters editors expanded their list and broke the Worst of 2023 into eight additional categories, including “The Craziest Analysis Award; The Damn Those Conservatives Award; The Joy of Hate Award for Joy Reid Rants; The Jihadist Journalism Award for Helping Hamas; The Damning Florida’s Dictator Award; The Praising and Protecting Old Joe Award; The Cursing the Conservative Court Award and the Celebrity Freak-Outs Award.” This year, The Jihadist Journalism Award for Helping Hamas went to CBS’s Imtiaz Tyab for his Hamas cheerleading and the implication that homicidal terrorists who murder babies and use rape as a tool of war are really just plucky little underdogs with a dream. Tyab told his audience, “You know, over the years, I’ve made frequent trips to Gaza and have spoken with several Hamas leaders, and, you know, they know their military capabilities are no match for Israel’s enormous firepower. But what they lack in firepower, they make up for in ideology and sheer determination.” Watch: Without further ado here is the winner (followed by the top runners-up): His infamous line “But what [Hamas] lack in fire power, they make up for in ideology and sheer determination.” pic.twitter.com/rr7tJCt6bv — MRCTV (@mrctv) December 28, 2023 MRC’s Tim Graham joined Newsmax to discuss the awards. — Tim Graham (@TimJGraham) December 28, 2023 Runners-up for the award include New York Magazine’s Eric Levitz, Los Angeles Times investigative reporter Adam Elmahrek, MSNBC Host Ayman Mohyeldin, and correspondent Debora Patta for the following Quote: s: Watch MRC’s full montage of the runners-up below.

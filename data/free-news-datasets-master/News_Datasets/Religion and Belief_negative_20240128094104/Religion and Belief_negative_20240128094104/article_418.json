    "text": "Dear Editor,\nWhere it all began, Christmas was cancelled this year in Bethlehem, the biblical birth place of Jesus, the bubbling place where traditionally, the world would visit at this time of the year. Earlier, The Washington Post reported, “The atmosphere in Bethlehem on the eve of Christmas this year is somber, dark, sad — and political.” The article stated, “This year there will be no tree. No parades, bands or music. No lights. No markets, no feasts, no carols. No Santas handing out candy to the children. And no pilgrims. No tourists.” Rami Asakrieh, a Franciscan friar, is pastor of St. Catherine’s Church, where midnight Mass is usually celebrated said, “It’s impossible to celebrate when so many — on both sides — have lost so much. We canceled the festivities as a sign of solidarity with the victims of the war.”\nThe message of peace and goodwill unto mankind for Christmas meant nothing as the number of casualties continue to escalate in war-torn areas, namely, Russia/Ukraine and Israel/Gaza. For Christians, Israel (the Promised Land) is the “Holy Land,” because it is the place where Jesus’ life and death unfolded. And, for Muslims, Jerusalem is the place where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. Guyana also came close to the brink of cancelling Christmas this year as fear gripped the nation from a threatening annexation of Essequibo from Venezuela. Guyanese are lucky to have escaped the perils of a potential war from their neighbour. Guyanese are thankful for the peace talk earlier this month in SVG. The dialogue initiated by Brazil’s President and the Prime Minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, provided the framework and the forum (Argyle Agreement) to prevent any military aggression from both countries, thus avoiding the probability of possible casualties. This “truce” allowed the Latin America/South America/Carib-bean to remain a peace zone for Christmas and going forward, hopefully.\nThe BBC reported at least 20,915 people have been killed and 54,918 wounded in Israeli attacks since October 7. The revised death toll from Hamas’s attack on Israel stands at 1,139, 695 Israeli civilians (including 36 children), 71 foreign nationals, and 373 security forces. The Hamas-Run Health Ministry and Government Media Office reported that “more than 8,000 children and 6,200 women had been killed. It also said that 310 medical personnel, 35 civil defense personnel and 97 journalists had been killed – all of them civilians.” According to the United Nation’s child agency, UNICEF, “Gaza is now the most dangerous place in the world to be a child.” Almost all of Palestine’s 2.3 million population have been displaced and a large part of Gaza has been devastated. According to the Israel media reports, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says, “war will not stop,” and he is ready to encourage Palestinians in Gaza to leave the enclave. Hamas has condemned the statement.\nThe New York Times and CNN reported over 500,000 casualties have been accounted for since the Russia/ Ukraine war began. Some 120,000 deaths are Russians with 180,000 injured troops while 70,000 are Ukraine killed with 120,000 wounded. Some 23,000 innocent civilians were caught up in the war and are reported missing or dead. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) verified a total of 9,614 civilian deaths during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as of September, 2023. Furthermore, 17,535 people were reported to have been injured. Foreigners account for almost 100. According to International News Safety Institute (INSI), 17 journalists died in the line of duty. Even the United Nations was not spared with 136 staff members killed. Evelyn Farkas, a former top Pentagon official for Ukraine who is now the executive director of the McCain Institute said, “These are people. Ukraine is a democracy, so the loss of lives could have greater political impact. But even in an autocracy, Vladimir Putin knows that public sentiment can make a difference.”\nBack in our jolly land of Guyana where mirth and merriment merged to manifest a happy Christmas for most of us, the moment was mired by mayhem on our roads and in the homes. Many families were denied the season’s pleasantries as their dear ones were taken away from them. It wasn’t an attack on democracy or the old Parliament Building, but the building did suffer a blow when a truck rammed into the fence last Thursday. Did this provide a sign as to what was to follow? The famous attorney, Mr. Rex McKay passed away. The very day, there was a head on collision in Essequibo which resulted in a fatality. In Port Kaituma, a 13-year-old girl allegedly drowned after falling off a boat. Friday brought some smiles as it was the last working day for most people before the holidays. The President also made history at Leonora when he cut the ribbon for the opening of the first bank in his home village. Demerara Bank opened its door for customers.\nOn Saturday, fire ravaged a building in Sophia, leaving 7 people homeless, damaging 3 vehicles, injuring 2 and scorching 2 other buildings. The Eve of Christmas, Sunday, provided much soured excitement. In North Rupununi, a pedestrian was struck by a car in an accident. Another pedestrian was not as lucky as he was killed by a truck reversing at Windsor Forest, West Coast Demerara. A man was shot dead during an attempted robbery in Campbeville. A husband was killed in a shooting incident by his reputed wife’s lover at Diamond, East Bank Demerara. Christmas Day was spoiled with the death of two friends involved in a speeding car accident at Le Destin, East Bank Esse-quibo and with another injured. The devastating fire at Linden killed 3 family members. Boxing Day saw I person injured during a robbery at a Chinese supermarket in Herstelling. As the wars continue abroad with no sign of coming to an end in sight, many more will not see the beginning of the New Year. Can Guyanese prevent the occurrence of the Christmas tragedies for the New Year’s holiday? Here’s wishing you and your family a harmless, healthy and happy New Year.\nSincerely,\nJai Lall",

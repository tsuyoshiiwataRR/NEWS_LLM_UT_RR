    "text": "AUBURN – It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of James Highley on Friday, Dec. 8, 2023. Originally from Los Angeles, Calif., James was born May 14, 1954, the 9th of 13 children. His parents, Arthur and Virginia Highley, immigrated to the US from the Philippines in the early 1950s, and James was the first member of their family to be born in the US.\nA skilled carpenter and builder, James picked up the trade in his teens. It was his passion and profession his entire adult life. His handiwork can be seen throughout Southern Maine.\nIn 1985 James relocated from California to the Lewiston/Auburn area to be closer to his children. Indeed, his most proud accomplishment was being a Dad. His son Justin Highley, who resides in Virginia with wife Missy and their two children Tyler and Alexis, his daughter Tamara Highley from Maine and stepdaughter Shawna from California. He is survived by his children, grandchildren, and his beloved life partner of 45 years, Julie Barrow. James was a loving father and grandfather. He will be forever missed.\nMemorial plans will be announced at a later date.\nSuccess. Please wait for the page to reload.

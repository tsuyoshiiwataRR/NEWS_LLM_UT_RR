    "text": "India designated the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction), or MLJK-MA, as an unlawful association under the Unlawful Activities Prevention law, the Scroll news portal said. The Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) is a separatist organisation led by Hurriyat Conference chairman Masarat Alam Bhat, who is imprisoned in Delhi’s Tihar Jail. The Scroll quoted Home Minister Amit Shah as saying in a social media post that the organisation and its members are involved in “anti-national and secessionist activities in Jammu and Kashmir supporting terrorist activities and inciting people to establish Islamic rule” in the Union Territory. “The Prime Minister Narendra Modi government’s message is loud and clear that anyone acting against the unity, sovereignty, and integrity of our nation will not be spared and face the full wrath of the law,” wrote Shah. The home ministry, in a notification, said that the leaders of the organisation have been involved in raising funds through various sources, including Pakistan and its proxy organisations, “for perpetrating unlawful activities”. The ministry said that Bhat has been involved in unlawful activities, which are “prejudicial to the integrity, sovereignty, security and communal harmony of the country”. It also said that the Central government believes that the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) will continue propagating “false narratives” and anti-national sentiments among the people of Jammu and Kashmir if there is no immediate curb or control of their activities.",

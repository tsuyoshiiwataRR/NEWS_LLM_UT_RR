    "text": "A Butler pastor previously accused of sexually assaulting two underage girls was charged last week with misdemeanor indecent assault of a female congregant he offered to mentor through a theology program, according to police documents. Charging documents acquired Thursday said Herman Rushing, pastor of By His Grace Christian Ministries, assaulted the woman in the office of the church after working on a packet meant to prepare her for ministry school.\nRushing, 67, is accused of touching the woman without her consent, grabbing her face and attempting to kiss her.\nThe victim disclosed to state police Rushing began rubbing her shoulders and kissing her neck while working on the packet. As she attempted to move away from him and jumped up, Rushing blocked her from the door.\nAs Rushing blocked the door, the victim said she “froze,” according to police. Rushing then groped her, grabbed her face and attempted to kiss her. The victim stated she pulled away from Rushing and was able to leave the building.\nThe woman told police Rushing told her he was chosen by God to minister.\nRushing also faces charges for allegedly assaulting two girls under the age of 16 on multiple occasions.\nHe is accused of assaulting a 13-year-old girl over the span of several years, beginning when she was 10 years old.\nA 16-year-old girl also disclosed Rushing had touched her inappropriately over the past year, police said, citing two instances that took place in his home.\nRushing was charged earlier this month with felonies and misdemeanors of indecent assault, corruption of minors and child endangerment and placed in Butler County Prison in lieu of $75,000 bail, which was reduced to $50,000 after he waived his preliminary hearing Dec. 21 before District Judge Kevin O’Donnell. He remains incarcerated.\nContinue Reading with One of the Options Below Already a subscriber?

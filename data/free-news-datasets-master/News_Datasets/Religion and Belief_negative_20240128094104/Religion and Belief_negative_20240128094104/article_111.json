    "text": "Good morning. This is the Thursday, Dec. 28 edition of First Up, the Star’s daily morning digest. Sign up\nto get it earlier each day, in your inbox.\nHere’s the latest on the recent spike in labour trafficking prosecutions, the future of Toronto’s parking meters and Toronto churches’ struggle to shelter refugees.\nDON’T MISS:\nThis Mountie helped dismantle a suspected labour trafficking ring — now he’s accused of starting his own\nIn late 2019, investigators had just dismantled what they alleged was a large labour trafficking ring in the Hamilton area. Officers criminally charged six people under worker exploitation laws after finding as many as 80 foreign workers housed in bug- and vermin-infested conditions, and being sent to work across southern Ontario, police said at the time. Now, police allege RCMP Const. Yahsif Israel Mane Monter learned how the Hamilton trafficking scheme operated — and then started his own, Sara Mojtehedzadeh and Rachel Mendleson report.\nHere’s what else police material obtained by the Star reveals.\nWait, what? Monter was arrested in May 2022 on human trafficking and several other charges, including firearm violations and animal cruelty related to his dog-breeding business, “Taskforce Rottweilers.”\nWord from Monter: Monter, who has been released on bail ahead of his scheduled May 2024 trial, declined to comment. His lawyer said he “will be pleading not guilty.”\nTime’s up for Toronto’s coin-only parking meters\nYou might be interested in\nIn 2000, Toronto had 16,000 coin-only parking meters. Today, only 178 remain — but their time is up, David Rider reports. The technological dinosaurs will be gone in the new year in the name of progress and city finances. They could be replaced with pay-and-display boxes, the city’s new “pay by plate” machines or even a new “mobile only” zones with no device at all.\nHere’s how the relics made their way into the city — and why they’re on their way out.\nWait, what? “We are collecting, on average, about 18 cents a day at single-space meters that cost about 87 cents a day to operate,” said Jeff Dea, the Toronto Parking Authority’s vice-president of business development. “They are really old, they’re at the end of their service life, they’re not running well and require continual maintenance so it’s time to pull them off the street and replace them with something better.”\nMore: Dea said the parking authority’s modernization plan also foresees the use of cameras to automatically record licence plates and bill the vehicle’s owner.\nCiting dwindling government support, Toronto churches are forced to close their doors to refugees\nFor nearly six months, volunteers and staff at two Toronto churches have worked overtime to shelter, support and feed hundreds of refugees arriving at their doors. But church leaders have seen the growing toll, from shelter workers experiencing psychological breakdowns to mounting personal credit card debt as the churches wrack up more than $800,000 in bills, Emily Fagan reports. Meanwhile, donations are dwindling and government support is sparse.\nHere’s why one church leader was shocked to hear the government wouldn’t be helping more.\nWord from Toronto: A spokesperson for the city said Toronto is working to support refugee claimants — but the absence of $97 million in promised federal funding has been challenging. The city estimates it will have spent $103 million supporting refugees this year, with hopes the federal government reimburses the money.\nWord from Ottawa: An Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada spokesperson said minister Marc Miller is in touch with Mayor Olivia Chow to discuss solutions, citing the $7 million asylum seekers reception centre in Peel Region announced last month.\nWHAT ELSE:\n-\nWant to see Doug Ford and Pierre Poilievre lose? Then the left needs to get its act together, Martin Regg Cohn writes.\n-\nThe UN is warning of impeded aid deliveries to Gaza as Israel expands its offensive. Here’s the latest.\n-\nPeel police are investigating a potential link between a gold seizure in Montreal and gold heist at Pearson Airport.\n-\nDonald Trump says he didn’t know his immigration rhetoric echoes Hitler. That’s part of a broader pattern.\n-\nProfits, losses and the bottom line. Here are five Canadian stocks to watch in 2024.\n-\nWhen did so many famous faces start looking the same? The look has never been mor e common — or achievable.\n-\nHere’s what will be trending in cruising in 2024, from the rise of boutique ships to the extra-extra long stay.\nPOV:\nCLOSE-UP:\nSOUTHERN GAZA: Palestinian journalists attempt to connect to the internet in Rafah on Wednesday, amid continuing battles between Israel and Hamas. Power cuts have become a fact of life in war-torn Gaza, but embedded SIM cards allow Palestinians to access the internet and stay in touch with loved ones abroad.\nThank you for reading First Up.

    "text": "Controversy is on the menu at a newly opened Palestinian restaurant in New York City that labeled its menu's seafood section \"From the river to the sea\" — a slogan Jewish groups recognize as antisemitic and people in the neighborhood are calling \"openly genocidal,\" according to a report. Ayat opened earlier this month in the Ditmas Park section of Brooklyn and its menus feature the phrase over the eatery's selection of branzino, red snapper and shrimp and salmon kebabs. Residents of the neighborhood, on their Facebook page, took offense at the owners, Abdul Elenani and Ayat Masoud, for using the controversial phrase in their menu, with one user condemning it being \"openly genocidal,\" the Daily Beast reported. The American Jewish Committee says the expression symbolizes \"control over the entire territory of Israel's borders, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.\" The full phrase, \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" \"is a rallying cry for terrorist groups and their sympathizers, from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) to Hamas, which called for Israel’s destruction in its original governing charter in 1988 and was responsible for the October 7, 2023 terror attack on Israeli civilians,\" the organization says. Elenani says that's not how she sees it, saying rather it's a non-violent plea for justice. “Our interpretation on it is just simply freedom and rights to the Palestinian people between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea,” he told the Daily Beast. “We’re just against the Zionist mentality of, like, eliminate or flatten Gaza now.” “Our neighbors are Jews, our friends are Jews, we work with Jewish people all day every day. We do not hate Jewish people. It’s the opposite,” he added. “Judaism and Islam, they are the two most similar religions.” Dahlia Schweitzer, who moved to Ditmas Park in 2020, told the outlet that the \"river to the sea\" language offends her, and dismisses the restaurant's claim that \"they're just advocating for freedom.\" \"They’re poking the hornets’ nest,\" Schweitzer said. “The best analogy that I could think [of] is if a restaurant that had Southern food had the Confederate flag on their menu, and tried to spin it as ‘Oh, this is just Southern pride.’ And it’s like, you know, don’t be coy,\" she said. Elenani said he tried to explain his position on Facebook but that he was censored by the social network administrators. He said he wanted to impress that his \"brand\" consists of two elements: “Number one is that I will always mention the occupation of the Palestinian people. And number two is that we will always advocate for peace,\" he said. The slogan has been part of demonstrations by pro-Palestinian protesters on college campuses after Hamas militants invaded Israel on Oct. 7.",

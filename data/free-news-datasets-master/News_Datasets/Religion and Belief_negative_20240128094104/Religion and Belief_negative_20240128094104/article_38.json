    "text": "By Theodore Bunker | Thursday, 28 December 2023 03:43 PM EST President Joe Biden on Thursday responded to his predecessor's controversial Christmas message with a reminder to \"love your enemies\" and \"do good to those who hate you.\" Former President Donald Trump, in one of several Christmas messages released on Truth Social, lashed out at \"evil and 'sick' … THUGS we have inside our Country who, with their Open Borders, INFLATION, Afghanistan Surrender, Green New Scam, High Taxes, No Energy Independence, Woke Military, Russia/Ukraine, Israel/Iran, All Electric Car Lunacy, and so much more, are looking to destroy our once great USA. MAY THEY ROT IN HELL. AGAIN, MERRY CHRISTMAS!\" Biden, a Catholic who attends church regularly, responded to Trump on X on Thursday, retweeting a link to a news story about Trump's Christmas message with the comment, \"There's an expression they say in church sometimes: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.\" Theodore Bunker, a Newsmax writer, has more than a decade covering news, media, and politics. © 2023 Newsmax.

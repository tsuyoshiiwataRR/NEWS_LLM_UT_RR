In a video shared on his TikTok page, the gentleman also failed preachers who lie to congregants and claimed he would run for gubernatorial position so that he could shut down all churches in [Nairobi](https://kiswahili.tuko.co.ke/tags/habari-za-kaunti-ya-nairobi/).

The problem with Christians is that you do not know your Bible and that is why you're being shifted all over and you don't know what you believe in,\" he said. He added that he has nothing against praying, fasting or paying tithes but urged Christians to also work. \"There are no lazy people like Christians; that is why I was telling you to stop dating church people. Ask them what their plan is when dating, and you will hear them say they have left everything in God's plan. God has given you breath and life; how do you live that to God,' he added. Stelome also said Africa, despite having the most prayer warriors, is still poor and the most corrupt continent. \"Prayers never work for anybody, you pray, and you go to work. You speak to God, and you go to work. But Christians want to do all that but not work. When are you going to work? Stop depending on men to tell you things from God. You can face Good personally. Churches have become business and that's why we are not going,' he said.

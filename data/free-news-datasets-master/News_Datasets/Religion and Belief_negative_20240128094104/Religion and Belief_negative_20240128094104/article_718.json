    "text": "As the year draws to a close, it’s important to reflect on a significant yet often overlooked issue affecting vulnerable segments of the Hindu community. Across various regions in India, there has been a troubling emergence of conversion rackets. These rackets are frequently linked to foreign entities, Islamic groups, and influential Christian missionary organisations. They target economically disadvantaged Hindus and tribal communities, exploiting their vulnerability with offers of monetary assistance, food, clothing, education, healthcare services, and other material benefits. In their desperate attempts to escape poverty, many individuals are swayed by these offers and convert to either Islam or Christianity. However, they soon realise that the relief provided is only temporary and does little to alter their fundamental hardships. They then undergo Ghar Wapsi.\nDespite the widespread nature of this issue, only a fraction of these cases gain public attention. This typically happens when vulnerable Hindus who have been misled are rescued, or when individuals, recognise the deceit they were subjected to, and decide to return to their Hindu faith through ‘Ghar Wapsi’.\nThis article aims to compile and highlight the numerous instances from this year where Hindu families or individuals, coerced into converting to either Islam or Christianity, chose to embrace their Hindu heritage once more. These stories not only shed light on the deceptive tactics used by evangelists and Islamists, who initially entice with financial and material aid but later resort to indoctrination but also underscore the resilience and enduring faith of those who choose to return to Hindu i sm .\n1. Ghar Wapsi in Etah In Uttar Pradesh’s Etah district, 35 individuals from 10 Christian families re-embraced to Sanatan Dharma. This event took place in the Jaranikalan village in the Shakrauli area, where these families had converted to Christianity in 1995, reportedly due to enticements. The Hindu Ekta Group interacted with these families and discovered that many were keen to return to Hinduism.\nConsequently, on 2nd January 2023, a special program was organised at the Pathwari Mata Temple in the village, where these 35 individuals participated in a havan ritual and embraced Sanatan Dharma. According to Shubham, founder of the Hindu Ekta Group, these families were lured and misled into converting to Christianity in 1995 and have been following Christian practices since then. However, several expressed a voluntary desire to revert to Sanatan Dharma and did the Ghar Wapsi.\n2. Another Ghar Wapsi in Etah In another incident, Shabnam from Etah district in Uttar Pradesh converted to Hinduism and changed her name to Neha Pathak on 16th January 2023. She married a Hindu man named Komesh Pathak, and for this, she sought the help of the High Court and district administration. Initially, both families were opposed to their marriage. Shabnam, who is a graduate and originally from Ghazipur, was living in Manesar, Haryana, with her elder sister. Komesh Pathak also resided there, working in a medical company. The couple met in Manesar, and over time, they fell in love.\nShabnam was already loving Hinduism, especially the festival of Diwali. After their marriage, she decided to formally adopt Hinduism and submitted a petition to the Allahabad High Court and the District Magistrate. The District Magistrate of Etah issued a notice inviting objections for 21 days. Upon receiving no objections during this period, the district administration issued her a certificate confirming her conversion to Hinduism.\n3. Mega Ghar Wapsi in Chhattisgarh by Prabal Pratap Judev In the Mahasamund district of Chhattisgarh, during the Shrimad Bhagwat Katha event held in Basna, approximately 1100 Christians belonging to about 325 families returned to Hinduism on 19th January 2023. BJP leader Prabal Pratap Singh Judev facilitated their Ghar Wapsi (return to Hinduism) by ritually cleansing their feet with the holy water of the Ganga.\nThose who underwent Ghar Wapsi expressed that they had gone away from their Dharma and converted to another religion, but after realising their mistake, they decided to come back to Hinduism. Pandit Himanshu Krishna Maharaj administered to these individuals an oath of loyalty to the Sanatan Dharma. Prabal Pratap Singh Judeo, a BJP leader from Chhattisgarh, continues to campaign for the return of converted individuals to their original faith.\n4. There can be no religion better than Hinduism – Sultana Begum On Friday, January 21, 2023, in a program of Bageshwar Dham Divya Darbar, a Muslim woman named Sultana Begum adopted Hinduism in the presence of Mahant Pandit Dhirendra Krishna Shastri. Sultana, hailing from Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, shared her story, saying, “My name is Sultana. My father’s name is Amir Khan and my mother is Sarwari Begum. I practised idol worship, which led to my family disowning me. They say that I am a disgrace to the Muslim community and that I will go to hell when I die.”\n#BREAKING | बागेश्वर दरबार में धीरेंद्र शास्त्री ने कुछ लोगों को हिंदू धर्म में वापसी करवाई\nदेखते रहिए रिपब्लिक भारत #LIVE : https://t.co/h34cjWzjtJ pic.twitter.com/bppHrEyNts\n— रिपब्लिक भारत (@Republic_Bharat) January 21, 2023 She further expressed, “I firmly believe that there can be no religion better than Hinduism. It’s a religion of civilization and values. In Hinduism, there are no marriages between siblings, and women’s lives are not destroyed. Practices like triple talaq do not exist. Here, marriage happens once with the sacred seven rounds around the holy fire, emphasising the significance of sindoor (vermilion), mangal sutra (sacred necklace), and the complete sixteen adornments for a married woman. I also worship Lord Krishna in the form of Laddu Gopal.”\n5. Salim Khan became Sukhram Das in Morena of Madhya Pradesh Salim Khan, a resident of the Ambah region in the Morena district of Madhya Pradesh, embraced Hinduism on 22nd January 2023, adopting the name Baba Sukhram Das. Salim was influenced by his growing faith in Lord Hanuman, having already been involved in devotional singing and chanting at the temple, eventually leading him to renounce his former religion.\nHe left his family and sought refuge in the Hanuman temple at Khadiyahar, considering the temple’s priest, Shri Shri 1108 Ram Khilavan Das Maharaj, as his guru. His guru initiated him and gave him the new name, Sukhram Das. Salim revealed that he has forsaken his wife, children, and grandchildren, including his entire family.\nA Ghar Wapsi ceremony was held at the Hanuman temple on his ‘homecoming’, attended by many locals. On hearing about Salim’s transformation, his family also arrived at the temple, where his wife expressed that she had no objections to his change of faith.\n6. Saba of Bareilly became Soni In Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, a young woman named Saba Bi, now known as Soni Deval, converted her religion to marry her Hindu boyfriend, Ankur Deval. The couple had been in a relationship for six years, but Saba’s family was opposed to their union. Saba and Ankur first met in Bisharatganj, Bareilly, where their fathers owned clothing shops. Their friendship gradually blossomed into love, leading to their decision to marry. Facing opposition from her family, who restricted her movements and communication, Saba took the bold step of leaving home to unite with Ankur.\nOn 1st February 2023, Saba left her home, and the following day, the couple wed at the Agastya Muni Ashram according to Hindu traditions. The ceremony was even attended and blessed by Sadhvi Prachi. Saba formalised her conversion and marriage through an affidavit and informed the collector’s office about her decision. Saba expressed fears for her life from her own family. She mentioned her deep appreciation for Hinduism and her enjoyment of participating in its worship practices. She also appreciated that Hinduism does not practice the ‘triple talaq’ system. Saba declared her intention to remain a Hindu for the rest of her life.\n7. ‘No point staying in a religion that persecutes all’ – Yusuf Khan On 7th February 2023, a Muslim family in Morena, Madhya Pradesh, publicly announced their decision to convert to Hinduism. The head of the family, Yusuf Khan, stated that for the past 30 years, he has been facing hardships from within the Muslim community itself.

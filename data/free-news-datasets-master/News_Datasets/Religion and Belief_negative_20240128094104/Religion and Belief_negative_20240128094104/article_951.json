    "text": "A new [RAF Scampton](https://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/all-about/raf-scampton) report which was published by the Home Office and removed days later has highlighted the possible tensions between two Muslim groups that would be housed on the former base. An 'equality impact assessment' was published on the UK Government website on Wednesday, December 27 and it revealed some new details about the proposed asylum centre at the former home of the Dambusters. The report, which was removed on December 29 due to being 'published in error', states that some of the population of asylum seekers would be split between Sunni and Shia Islam sects which \"could potentially cause tensions\" on the base. It adds that \"consideration will be given to separate worship areas\" and the mixing of these populations will be monitored. Religion is the only characteristic group that the Home Office considers to have 'medium' potential for a positive/negative impact. All other characteristic groups listed in the report, including age, sex and disability, were considered to have a 'low' potential for a positive/negative impact. Poll - [Are you worried about the RAF asylum seekers plans?](https://xd.wayin.com/display/container/dc/681b1626-eb89-4dcc-871e-0201734dcdec?mode=responsive&scrolling=no) A recent High Court ruling deemed that up to 2,000 asylum seekers could be lawfully housed at RAF Scampton despite West Lindsey District Council's attempts to stop the plans. WLDC has since announced that it intends to appeal the ruling and continue the fight against housing asylum seekers at the former base. Class Q planning permission was obtained by the Home Office in April 2023 and is due to expire on April 13, 2024. The Home Office revealed in the equality impact report that it intends to seek planning permission under a Special Development Order to cover temporary planning permission for a further three years. Within the now deleted government report, it explains that free shuttle bus transport, in collaboration with Lincolnshire County Council and the City of Lincoln Council, will be provided to asylum seekers to travel to local urban areas, including Lincoln, for recreational purposes and other purposes. This includes travel to religious buildings to practise their religion or belief. The report states that the asylum seekers, who will come straight from Manston immigration centre in Kent, can leave the Scampton site for up to seven days at a time unless a reasonable explanation is given for their prolonged absence. Asylum seekers will be able to interact with local people and make use of local amenities and facilities located outside of the site. However, the Home Office report states that the asylum seekers will be provided with enough services and facilities on-site that they will not need to leave to access them. One section of the report reads: \"Asylum seekers accommodated at Scampton will be provided with dietary and culturally and religiously appropriate meals, facilities to use on site e.g. Wi-Fi, TV room, gymnasium, laundry room with washers and driers, provision for practising their faith including religious observance and regular organised indoor and outdoor activities. \"Additional facilities, including sports facilities and social spaces, will be brought online as the site develops and when it reaches its maximum capacity.\" Asylum seekers will also be provided with mobile phones and laptops on-site on request which can be used to maintain contact with other parties including their legal representation and Migrant Help. Those housed at the former RAF base will have access to free NHS healthcare. Primary GP-led healthcare will be provided on site from the day of arrival of the first cohort of asylum seekers, including dedicated isolation rooms for those with suspected/confirmed contagious diseases. The maximum length of stay for individual asylum seekers on site will be nine months, except when the Home Secretary is unable to find \"suitable onward dispersal accommodation\". The report also addresses potential protests from three groups which include: Local residents and politicians who object to the use of the site for accommodation which had been earmarked by the West Lindsey District for a Â£300m redevelopment programme. Pro-immigration groups who have concerns about the perceived conditions on the site. Anti-immigration groups who object to the housing of asylum seekers or their arrival in the country. A section of the report reads: \"Experience from Wethersfield and Portland is that protests reduce once the site has opened, but it is recognised that this may not be the case at every site, including Scampton. Site security and operations staff liaise with the police on an almost daily (primarily ad-hoc) basis and police response to protests has been calibrated to ensure there is no escalation of tensions. \"We continue to work closely with the police to minimise disruption, including after the site becomes operational.\" Lincolnshire Police are providing three dedicated Community Relation officers to reassure and safeguard the local community, asylum seekers, and workers on, as well as visitors to, the site to provide a more \"visible presence\". It has been agreed that screened fencing will be put in place to restrict the sight of Pollyplatt Primary School from the site. A date has still not been confirmed for the arrival of the first 30 asylum seekers, which will be gradually increased over time. All asylum seekers will be males aged between 18 and 65 and could come from a number of countries including: Iraq, Iran, Albania, Eritrea, Pakistan, Nigeria, China, Afghanistan, Syria, Sudan, El Salvador, and Ethiopia. The Home Office has been approached for comment but did not respond by the time of publication.",

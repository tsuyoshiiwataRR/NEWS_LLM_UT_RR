    "text": "New Delhi: In a recent development, Gurmeet Ram Rahim, the head of Dera Sacha Sauda in Sirsa, Haryana, currently serving jail time, has filed a defamation case against a YouTuber named Shyam Meera Singh. In the petition filed on behalf of Ram Rahim in Delhi High Court, a demand was made to direct Shyam to remove the video uploaded on YouTube in which Ram Rahim is accused of deceiving his followers. The petition was heard in the court of Justice Shalinder Kaur. The court issued a notice on the matter. The court has scheduled the next hearing for Saturday. During the hearing, Ram Rahim’s lawyers argued that the video uploaded by Shyam Meera Singh was defamatory and insulting in nature. They further claimed that Singh is a “habitual criminal” with a registered case against him for insulting the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Additionally, Singh was reportedly terminated from Aaj Tak earlier for “insulting the Prime Minister.” However, Shyam Meera Singh or his lawyer were not present in the court during the hearing. According to information, a video was uploaded by Shyam Meera Singh on December 17, titled “How did Gurmeet Ram Rahim fool his devotees?” In response, a legal notice was sent to Singh on behalf of Ram Rahim. However, according to Ram Rahim’s lawyers, Singh refused the request to remove the video. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2017 for the rape of two disciples. Additionally, he is serving a life sentence for his involvement in the 2002 killings of Dera Manager Ranjit Singh and Journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati.

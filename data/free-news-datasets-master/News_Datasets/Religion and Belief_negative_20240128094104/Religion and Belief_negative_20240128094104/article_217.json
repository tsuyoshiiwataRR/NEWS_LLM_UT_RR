    "text": "A pioneer of the pro-family movement, Rev. Donald Wildmon, founder of the American Family Association and American Family Radio, passed away Thursday, Dec. 28, in Tupelo, Miss., at age 85.\nWildmon, born in 1938, started out as a pastor, serving as a United Methodist minister for 13 years. However, as the AFA's website notes, in the late 1970s, troubled by the profanity and indecency he saw on television, Wildmon founded the Mississippi-based American Family Association – at first, from his kitchen table. A decade and a half later, in 1991, the AFA spun off American Family Radio, which currently has 1.5 to 2 two million listeners.\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\nWildmon's son and current AFA president, Tim Wildmon, said his father's many accomplishments in pursuit of preserving America's traditional, moral, family-oriented culture never went to his head. \"Those were the visions that God gave him to start,\" said Tim, \"and he was a servant of the Lord and he followed through with what the Lord gave him to do.\"\nTRENDING:\nCan the McCloskeys get their guns back? Judges pull trigger on ruling\nOthers offered heartfelt remembrances of Wildmon and his lasting impact on America:\nPastor Bert Harper of \"Exploring the Word\" on American Family Radio, and who spent years on AFA's board of directors, told American Family News, \"Brother Don Wildmon was a visionary. He could see down the road 10 years ahead of time.\"\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nDr. Alex McFarland, Harper's co-host of \"Exploring the Word,\" called Wildmon \"an amazingly influential, wonderfully faithful\" man of God, adding: \"In the late 1970s, as our nation was beginning a moral and spiritual decline, God raised up some leaders who would ultimately change the world and our nation for the good. Certainly, one of the most prominent was the late Dr. Don Wildmon. … He set in motion an influence for the gospel that only God could measure. What a legacy he leaves, what an example for us all.\"\nTed Beahr, chairman of the Christian Film & Television Commission and editor of Movieguide, said: \"Don had an ability to not just target the exact right problem, but he also had ability to galvanize people.\"\nDr. James Dobson, founder of \"Focus on the Family\" and currently host of \"Family Talk,\" said the biggest driver of Wildmon's legacy would be his courage, telling AFN: \"I think it would be his fearlessness in taking on big corporations and the powerful executives who scared everybody else.\"\nLikewise, Dr. Robert Jeffress, senior pastor of the huge First Baptist Dallas church, and who hosts a daily radio program on AFR, commented: \"Don Wildmon was a true pioneer in encouraging pastors like myself and thousands of others to speak out on the great moral issues of the day. He will be sorely missed by a country that needs him more than ever right now. We pray for the Wildmon family, and wish them every encouragement from Heaven that they will see Don again in Heaven, with all of the rewards he deserves.\"\nAnd AFA executive vice president Ed Vitagliano summarized the loss of Donald Wildmon this way:\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\"Bro. Don Wildmon was an extraordinary man and an extraordinary figure in American culture. Because of the humility of Brother Don, sometimes it is hard to gauge the impact he had – but his vision for a Christian community that was active in politics and culture was part of a movement we believe of the Holy Spirit in this country.\"\n\"It was not just Brother Don; it was Jerry Falwell and Dr. James Dobson and Phyllis Schlafly and others who understood the direction that this country was taking and knew that the Church had to speak up – that the Church could not censor itself and be paralyzed by a culture that wanted to intimidate the Christian community and make them silent.\n\"Brother Don's vision was huge in our culture, extremely influential, and because he and his wife, Lynda, raised strong children, strong in the Christian faith, who now have grandchildren who continue that legacy, AFA and AFR continue the vision and the passion of Brother Don to see this nation return to a place of faithfulness to God that we might be a nation once again whose God is the Lord.\"\n\"It is sad for those of us here at AFA and AFR. This really is like a family. This is a hard moment, a difficult moment for us, very sad, but we also believe in the resurrection and the power of God to take away – through the resurrection of Christ – the sting of death. We know Bro. Don is in Heaven with his Lord who he served faithfully and with others in his family, others that he knows from that movement to get people involved in culture. We are happy for Brother Don and we do covet the prayers of our faithful listeners and supporters for the Wildmon family and for this ministry. We continue to ask them to pray for our nation and pray that God might send a revival and an awakening that will restore the biblical foundations of this country.\"\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nIMPORTANT NOTE TO WND READERS: America – long the freest, most prosperous, powerful, altruistic and Christian nation on earth – is on the brink of destruction. Every decent and aware American adult knows this. The evidence is everywhere.\nDemocrat politicians today overwhelmingly favor late-term abortion up to the very moment of birth – formerly known as \"infanticide.\" They encourage children too young to drive or vote to have their breasts and/or sex organs amputated in pursuit of a \"gender transition\" that is both delusional and impossible, and which leads to staggering rates of depression and suicide. They have not just allowed, but ENGINEERED, a full-scale foreign invasion of America across her southern border.\nTheir standard bearer, President Joe Biden – a senile, pathologically dishonest and epically corrupt career political hack – is destroying America's economy, energy sector, military, law enforcement, election integrity, national security, Constitution and overall national wellbeing as rapidly as possible. At the same time, Team Biden demonizes and, increasingly, IMPRISONS critics as \"violent extremists,\" \"domestic terrorists,\" \"white supremacists\" and \"insurrectionists.\" Indeed, they're currently engaged in an obviously corrupt multi-front legal war against Biden's chief political rival, Donald J. Trump, in an attempt to send the 45th president of the United States to prison for the rest of his life.\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nNone of this constitutes \"politics\" in any conventional or traditional American sense. Rather, it is all darkly spiritual. The greatest nation on earth is in the throes of a full-blown spiritual war between good and evil.\nThe big question, then, is WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SAVE AMERICA? Fortunately, real answers and uncommon wisdom are showcased in the December issue of WND's critically acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine,\n\"CAN AMERICA BE SAVED? The world's freest, most Christian nation is on the brink of destruction.\"\nIn this very special issue, readers will experience the best and deepest thoughts and strategies on how to restore America to her former goodness and greatness, from some of the nation's most respected analysts – everyone from Tucker Carlson to Dennis Prager to Victor Davis Hanson to Newt Gingrich and many more.\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nWHISTLEBLOWER is available in\nboth the popular print edition and a state-of-the-art digital version, either single issues or discounted annual subscriptions.\nFor 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

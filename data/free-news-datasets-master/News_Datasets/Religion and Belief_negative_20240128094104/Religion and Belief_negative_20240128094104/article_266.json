    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the United Kingdom's largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings \"shocking\", while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was \"deeply worrying\".\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: \"There is no place for hate in our society.\"\nBeing Jewish, or Israeli, in America after October 7: Haaretz must reads Kanye West apologizes to Jews in Hebrew: 'Regret any pain I may have caused' 'It's uncertain which threat is most pressing – antisemitism from the left or the right' The Community Security Trust described the figures as \"shocking\" and said they made clear \"the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7\".\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: \"This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fueled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\"\n\"It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.\"\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that \"levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging\".\nIman Atta, the organization's director, said there had been a \"significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7\", adding: \"The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanizing slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\"\n\"We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.\"\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\nSome forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences - for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nOpen gallery view British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak signs messages and prayers for Israel at a Jewish school in London on Monday. Credit: Jonathan Buckmaster / Reuters A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings \"provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7\".\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organizations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had \"caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress\".\nA spokesman added: \"We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.\"\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: \"Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\"\n\"The government's laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.\"\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\"\n\"We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\"\n\"Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.\"\nClick the alert icon to follow topics:\n2023 Israel-Gaza War\nAntisemitism\nUnited Kingdom\nEurope Jews",

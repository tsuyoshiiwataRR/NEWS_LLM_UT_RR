    "text": "Methuen - Elaine M. (Kazanjian) Crane, 81, of Methuen, passed away peacefully on Wednesday, December 27, 2023 at Wingate Residences at Haverhill, MA. She was the beloved wife of Eugene F. \"Gene\" Crane, Jr. with whom she shared 58 years in marriage.\nBorn and raised in Lawrence, daughter of the late George and Mary (Concanon) Kazanjian, Elaine was a graduate of Lawrence High School. She later received a Bachelor's Degree in Education from Merrimack College, and a Master's degree in Education from Salem State University. Following her marriage to Gene, they settled in Methuen, where they made their home and raised their children. Elaine was a high school teacher for the City of Methuen for 38 years.\nWith family always at the center of her attention, Elaine loved time spent with her family, especially during the holidays, as this was an opportunity for them to come together and celebrate. She also enjoyed her many shopping adventures, with family and friends, guaranteed to most often have purchased items for others rather than herself. She made fond memories while boating with Gene over the course of many years. Most of all, she embraced the time spent with her grandchildren, always looking forward to the next opportunity.\nIn addition to her husband, Gene, Elaine is survived by and will be greatly missed by her children, Jacqueline Cuomo and her husband, Mark of Concord, NH, Eugene Crane III and his wife, Jennifer of Derry, NH, grandchildren, Hannah, Matthew, Benjamin, Nicholas; brother, George Kazanjian; and many nieces and nephews.\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider donating in Elaine's memory to the Alzheimer's Association at www.alz.org.\nRelatives and friends are respectfully invited to attend visiting hours on Friday, December 29, 2023 between 4 to 7 p.m. at Cataudella Funeral Home, 126 Pleasant Valley Street, Methuen, MA. A funeral mass will be celebrated on Saturday, December 30, 2023 at 11 a.m. at St. Monica Church, 212 Lawrence Street, Methuen, MA. Interment will be in St. Patrick Cemetery in Lowell, MA.

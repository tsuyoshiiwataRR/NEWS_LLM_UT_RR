    "text": "How Congress Uses Syntax to Justify Genocide Let’s look at republican rhetoric in university presidents’ congressional interrogation Context on the congressional hearing on anti-Semitic speech on university campuses Liz Magill’s resignation Saturday, December 10th as president of the University of Pennsylvania follows a tense congressional testimony regarding elite universities’ responses to on-campus, student-led, pro-Palestine protests — including Jewish student groups such as student chapters of Jewish Voice for Palestine — that have been labeled antisemitic by conservatives. On December 5th, NY Republican Congresswoman and House Republican Conference chair Elise Stefanik questioned Magill and other elite universities’ presidents (MIT’s Sally Kornbluth, and Harvard’s Claudine Gay) regarding their universities’ public positions on the student response to the Palestinian genocide. After the hearing, many in the mainstream political landscape called for Magill’s resignation — calls to which Magill acquiesced five days after the testimony. Congresswoman Stefanik’s rhetoric differs from (former) Penn President Magill A closer analysis of speakers’ varying syntactic strategies in the hearing’s transcript reveals how Stefanik’s weaponization of simple syntax conceals fallacious logic to aggressively control discourse, whereas Magill’s qualified hypotheticals failed to challenge Stefanik’s narrow terms and violent implications. While Stefanik’s rhetorical choices serve capitalist interests and the military-industrial complex enabling the oppression of Palestinians, Magill’s ambiguous language is nonetheless complicit in upholding institutional power structures that perpetuate injustices. However, both speakers uphold existing United States and Israeli power structures. A speaker’s syntactic choices — how a speaker structures their sentences — masquerade as stylistic decisions. Theorists from Michel Foucault to Erich Fromm to Noam Chomsky argue that syntactic choices are instrumental in shaping discourse and power dynamics. As Fromm contends, language propagates unequal power relations embedded in economic systems. A Marxist lens exposes how Stefanik and Magill’s syntactic choices in the hearing not only expose how language reinforces existing institutional power structures such as Congress and Higher Education, but their syntactic choices serve capitalist interests as well as the corporate military complex undergirding Israeli occupation and genocide. In this congressional hearing’s case, both/all speakers’ syntactic strategies support Israel’s genocide. Examining syntactic choices in Stefanik’s questioning and Magill’s responses enables us to recognize and understand dominant groups’ strategies for shaping public discourse, that is, maintaining their power over non-dominant groups. To do so, we’ll listen to Stefanik and Magill’s rhetorical patterns around ambiguity, narrative control, and false logic that undermine substantive dialogue. Our focus is analyzing Elise Stefanik and Liz Magill’s syntactic decisions in the hearing in order to demonstrate how the concept of syntax in language is a powerful instrument for oppressing marginalized groups. To conduct this analysis, we’ll examine the tense exchange between Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and former Penn president Liz Magill in the December 5th congressional hearing. We will identify syntactic choices, logical fallacies, and meaning-making in both speakers’ statements, and find Stefanik’s statements simultaneously more logically inconsistent, while also more effective given the hearing’s purpose and occasion aligning oneself with Stefanik’s rhetoric. I’ll be transparent about my views I will be transparent about two things: 1) I support the Palestinian cause and consider Zionism an oppressive ideology that manifests in violence, and 2) I do not agree with Magill’s statements and believe that her language, like Stefanik’s, not only fails to affirm the Palestinian cause but serves to reinforce Palestinian oppression. We’ll begin with the opening of Stefanik and Magill’s exchange. Let’s analyze the opening exchange Stefanik: Ms. Magill, at Penn, does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn’s rules or code of conduct? Yes or no? Magill: If the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment. Yes. Stefanik: I am asking, specifically calling for the genocide of Jews, does that constitute bullying or harassment? Magill: If it is directed, and severe, pervasive, it is harassment. Syntactically, Magill’s response to Stefanik’s questioning adheres to grammar conventions. Her response demonstrates some literary skill: her tricolon (three parallel words, phrases, or sentences) creates rhythm; her asyndeton (a stylistic choice wherein a speaker deliberately omits conjunctions — in this case, Magill omits but implies “then”) names three criteria for harassment concisely and with a more engaging ‘human touch’. But already Stefanik backs her aggressive questioning with false dichotomies. In her active syntax, she seizes control, while the hesitance and hypothetical framing of Magill surrenders power dynamics to her interlocutor. Gerunds can misdirect an audience Israel’s occupation of Palestinian land embodies a settler-colonial power imbalance. We hear Stefanik echo this imbalance to construct a reality-denying Palestinian humanity. As Fanon observed of African colonial history, colonial powers repeatedly ensured imperialist rule by using discourse that elevated the oppressor’s false sense of victimhood to justify violence against the dehumanized. In propping up an Ivy League student, whom she has not named, hypothetically calling for Jewish genocide, Stefanik does just this. Using a gerund here (“calling”) is part of the trap she sets generic action, leading to a specific and deterministic response. A subtle choice: adding a subject and possessive to the gerund clause (“a student’s calling for”) would have made the question rhetorically weaker than Magill’s measured, criteria-based response. And in conflating Jewish with Zionist, Stefanik broadens the nature of these ‘calls for genocide.’ Rather than framing pro-Palestine protest as anti-Zionist, Stefanik frames the ‘calls for genocide’ as ‘calls for the genocide of all Jewish people.’ This misdirection aims at erasure. In m manipulating the history of stark and horrendous anti-Semitic violence, Stefanik counters not anti-Semitism but ignores present Palestinian conditions. These choices serve her interests: an act of political theater to further the Republican project of equating ‘liberal institutions’ with antisemitism. Fanon would note echoes of 17th-century European colonial projects’ discourse in Stefanik’s own. These echoes manifest not solely in content but in form. Stefanik uses stronger verbs. She distinguishes her statements from the neutrality and passivity of Magill by using gerund forms of strong verbs (‘calling for,’ ‘bullying’), strong verbs (‘violate,’ ‘constitute’) loaded language (‘genocide’, and inversion (‘does that constitute’). She not only stronger verbs — she uses stronger nouns. Her use of the word genocide regarding Jewish people appropriates pro-Palestinian diction choices while echoing the language used in reference to the Holocaust, the most infamous act of antisemitism in the global consciousness. Israel’s indiscriminate violence in Gaza is genocide. Her syntax, too, is stronger: Stefanik’s inversion — ending the sentence with the interrogative independent clause — emphasizes the close-ended question to which Magill will find difficulty responding. Conditional clauses are no match for logical fallacies Magill’s challenges begin immediately. She opens her sentence with a conditional clause (‘if…’). In opening her sentence with a conditional, Magill frames her response as hypothetical. If Magill had said ‘If the speech turns into conduct,’ she would have pushed Stefanik to invoke specificity, tangible student actions. Instead, Magill remains abstract — permitting Stefanik to continue using hypothetical situations. And since Stefanik hasn’t defined her terms (“bullying,” “harassment”), Magill correctly responds to the degree of logical consistency. However, correct isn’t always effective. Though her neutral tone and conditional phrasing reflect institutional constraints out of her personal control, these syntactic choices avoid direct confrontation in a situation Stefanik established as emotionally charged. Stefanik uses the ‘False Dilemma’ logical fallacy Emotionally charged does not mean logically sound. Despite her direct, declarative syntax, Stefanik’s argument employs the False Dilemma logical fallacy, which misrepresents a nuanced issue as binary and mutually exclusive (“this or that”, “yes or no”) when more possibilities that may or do indeed exist. In this particular False Dilemma, responding to Stefanik with an answer other than “yes” leads to perceived indecisiveness — and emotional inconsideration — on Magill’s part. In shifting discourse from logical analysis to emotional reaction Stefanik gains the upper hand; repeating her binary question forces Magill into the defensive. If an audience accepts the False Dilemma, Stefanik may build an echo chamber implying Magill’s complicity in a hypothetical situation. Stefanik presents this hypothetical situation — “calling for the genocide of Jews” — as concrete. She presents this hypothetical situation as a binary choice. It’s X or it’s Y. In doing so, Stefanik chooses to ignore nuance and consequences. Framing her question as binary precludes conversation. Stefanik takes rhetorical control of the dialogue. She seeks to establish a narrative in which there is a single-word, straightforward answer. Her technique forces her respondent into either agreeing or disagreeing, or else risk coming off as evasive — Magill won’t assert her own views, which undermines her argument’s logical clarity and her own credibility — or complicit — she doesn’t agree, so she must disagree. If Magill qualifies Stefanik’s claim, Magill will appear complicit in anti-Semitism and “the genocide of Jews.” These syntactic structures restrict substantive conversation. In a time of viral video, Stefanik seeks more of a “gotcha” moment than an ethical discussion. In this case, Congresswoman Stefanik’s inflammatory rhetoric and false binaries exploitatively link a hypothetical scenario of racist speech to the actual genocide of Palestinians. Her discursive tactic upholds the economic dominance fueling Palestinian displacement and violence. Her language obscures the long-standing billions of American military aid funding Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes, theft of land, and deadly police raids commonplace for decades. This syntactic strategy isn’t novel. Stefanik’s discourse mirrors a wider right-wing syntactic strategy: framing discourse through fallacious narrow options to maintain existing social hierarchies. Ultimately Magill loses the battle by entering the battle. Stefanik’s early rhetorical dominance through weaponizing emotion and narrow choices makes apparent her political agenda of manufacturing consent for oppression, against Magill’s ineffective attempts at nuance. While Magill hopes to inject thoughtful qualifications, Stefanik immediately closes space for substantive dialogue by restricting options with binary syntax designed to back opponents into corners. Whereas Stefanik limits acceptable responses and goes on offense through syntax and fallacious logic, Magill plays defense in reaching for reason against hostility. Let’s look at the second part of the exchange Stefanik: So the answer is yes. Magill: It is a context-dependent decision, Congresswoman. Stefanik: It’s a context dependent decision. That’s your testimony today, calling for the genocide of Jews is depending upon the context, that is not bullying or harassment. This is the easiest question to answer. Yes, Ms. Magill. Yes or no? Magill: If the speech becomes conduct, it can be harassment, yes. In qualifying Stefanik’s hypothetical with “context-dependent” Magill gestures toward rebuttal; Magill’s concluding “yes” undermines her own refutation of Stefanik’s implication that, due to her inability to directly commit to the support of Israel at the expense of campus free speech and Palestinian lives, Magill is unfit to serve as the University of Pennsylvania’s president. Qualifying a claim without challenging its underlying assumptions gives power to that claim. Though Magill speaks as if nuanced, claiming “it is a context-dependent decision,” she does not provide this context. People of diverse political beliefs agree that context matters in politics. In deciding to omit context clarifying her own position on the Palestinian genocide, Magill restricts the level of support she can gain from her audience. Magill’s neglect to situate her audience within the context leaves her argument nutrient-deficient. She could have responded to Stefanik’s genocide claim; her choice to ignore the word ‘genocide’ leaves Stefanik’s argument with the record for most loaded language. Through casually deploying terminology like “genocide” using authoritative syntax, Stefanik helps normalize violence against marginalized groups when such language is credibly adopted by dominant political factions. Stefanik uses the ‘False Equivalence’ logical fallacy We find Magill and Stefanik repeating their respective approaches from the conversation’s opening. Magill uses conditional statements; Stefanik uses logical fallacy to cover holes in her claims. The fallacy? False Equivalence. Her False Equivalence equates calls for Palestinian freedom with calls for Jewish genocide in order to silence political actors. In other words, equates hypothetical genocide-calling speech with the act of exterminating targeted civilian population groups. Again Stefanik opens with three declarative statements in service of reminding the audience of her viewpoint. Her position will be clear to an audience of wide-ranging listening comprehension. Magill’s syntax once again goes on the defensive. Where Stefanik began with unfounded authority, Magill began with ethical clarification. Stefanik uses the ‘Affirming the Consequent’ logical fallacy Stefanik’s direct, declarative sentence has already undermined Magill’s rhetorical credibility. Stefanik’s opening with “So” establishes her greater assertiveness. Magill, Stefanik implies, tiptoes around her own [Magill’s] views. She implies “If not yes, then no.” Another logical fallacy: Affirming the Subsequent. ‘If not A, then B, therefore A is false,’ Stefanik claims Using the logical inconsistencies she presents as objectively true, Stefanik commands Magill to repeat Stefanik’s assertion. In Stefanik’s unevidenced conclusion, her declarative strategy defeats Magill’s suggestion of nuance. Nuance is impossible without topical clarity. Arguments require clear definitions. If speakers do not agree on their definitions, or worse, speak in ignorance, then any verbal exchange is not an argument but dialogue. Both speakers fail to define their terms. What’s ‘conduct’ to Stefanik? To Magill? To the audience? And ‘harassment’? The audience’s definitions may differ from Stefanik’s, Magill’s, and from each others’. Magill is vague Magill’s sentence’s conditional structure fails to clarify her views — her syntax too produces vagueness. Syntactic vagueness suggests a speaker’s lack of decisiveness. Speaking directly, and using active voice, performs self-confidence. Rhetorically, if a speaker’s argument is vague, then the questioner may exploit this vagueness for their own ends. And that’s what Stefanik does. “Yes or no,” she repeats several times. Magill doesn’t respond with either of these, but neither does she address the logical fallacies within Stefanik’s questioning. Instead, she uses conditional statements and passive voice. Speakers’ active voice strengthens their arguments. Arguments of speakers are generally weakened by their use of passive voice. In doing so she evades assigning judgment to the actions of Stefanik’s imaginary genocidal harasser. Magill’s subject inversion constructs an opportunity for Stefanik to sharpen her questioning, however fallacious her rhetoric. Stefanik’s syntactic choices leave audiences with an impression of the greater certainty of Stefanik’s argument for Israel’s right to genocide; given less certainty is Magill’s conditional statement response. Let’s look at the concluding statements Stefanik: Conduct meaning committing the act of genocide. The speech is not harassment. This is unacceptable. Ms. Magill, I’m gonna give you one more opportunity for the world to see your answer. Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn’s Code of Conduct when it comes to bullying and harassment? Yes or no? Magill: It can be harassment. Stefanik: The answer is yes. After a bizarre definition of “conduct” as “committing the act of genocide.” — unusual, confusing, and makes no logical sense — Magill misses an opportunity to undermine her interrogator’s reasoning. Rather than go on the offensive, Magill continues embracing passive syntax in her use of the model verb “can.” Modal verbs (e.g. “can,” “may,” “must”) are used to express possibility or necessity. Modal verbs often introduce ambiguity or flexibility in a statement’s interpretation. Magill’s use of the modal verb “can” implies multiple outcomes. If something can be, then that same thing also cannot be. Magill’s modal verb may suggest a rebuttal — a ‘hey you’re saying that X is necessarily the case, but it’s not necessarily the case but it sometimes is the case’ — but her modal verb decides to leave it there: a suggestion, an isolated idea. Stefanik, in contrast, places the world behind her in providing Magill the “opportunity” for “the world to see your answer” is disingenuous. She implies that the entire world holds her own viewpoint. Stefanik ‘succeeds’ And it works. “Yes,” concludes Magill. Though she attempts to mask agreement in passivity, conditions, and left-branching sentence structure, Magill agrees to Stefanik’s faux claim. Ultimately Magill’s use of passive voice, subjunctive mood, and subject inversion creates ambiguity. Magill’s responses do not persuade the audience to condemn the Palestinian genocide. They’re not radical; they’re ambiguous. Stefanik exploits this ambiguity to amplify mainstream support for the Palestinian genocide. Due to Magill’s ambiguity, Stefanik’s rhetoric succeeds in its impression, despite her logical fallacies. Meanwhile, Magill’s equivocation and ambiguous syntax fail to name — and therefore fails to disrupt — American and British-made structures oppressing Palestinians. Theorist Erich Fromm would see Magill as perpetuating the linguistic rules serving elite class interests, an elite class invested in endless asymmetrical warfare. In an attempt at neutrality amid clear oppression, Magill’s equivocation makes her complicit in the capitalist forces commodifying Palestinian genocide. Conclusion In her final address to Magill, Stefanik echoes her earlier statement: “So the answer is yes.” But in this instance, Stefanik drops the “So.” In dropping the “So,” Stefanik implies her authority. Following her fallacious reasoning, Stefanik presents her conclusion as final. No opportunity for qualification. It’s logical, Stefanik implies, using a variety of illogical strategies. Simple, aggressive syntax sticks its stubby fingers into logical holes. It controls narratives. Stefanik weaponizes declarative statements, false binaries, and loaded words to force university presidents’ faltering responses. Stefanik’s syntactic dominance propagates problematic premises while shutting the door to substantive debate. Magill has the greater syntactic skill. Her sentences are more complex in syntax, diction, and logical consistency. But qualifications and ambiguous language surrender authority to the powerful. Magill’s hypothetical framing and vague concessions granted unchecked legitimacy to the very assumptions she ostensibly challenged. Her failure to name injustice then upheld institutional biases enabling systematic violence. Stefanik’s authoritative tone and declarative syntax undermine Magill’s accuracy. An academic setting demands logical consistency at concision’s expense; a public hearing demands concision at logic. Ironically, it’s Magill’s superior logical reasoning that provides Stefanik opportunities to diminish Magill’s rhetorical effectiveness. The contrast between Stefanik’s declarative rhetoric and Magill’s syntactic passivity showcases what Fanon proved in 1961: language constructed by ruling institutions serves the oppressor; and serves to dehumanize the colonized. “Neutral,” bureaucratic syntax provides cover for violent imperialist regimes like present-day Israel to continue settler conquest and indigenous erasure, materially and discursively. Language oppresses when marginalizing groups construct it. Even simple syntax can normalize marginalization through unconscious biases. In Stefanik’s presidential rout, we hear political rhetoric dehumanizing the vulnerable by linking ambiguous speech to material domination. In this case, discourse solidified congressional authority over student academic dissent; and Israeli impunity over Palestinian lives.",

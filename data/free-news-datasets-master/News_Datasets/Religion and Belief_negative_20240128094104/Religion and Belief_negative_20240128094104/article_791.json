    "text": "The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has declared the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir-Masarat Alam faction (MLJK-MA) as an ‘unlawful association’ under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Law (UAPA).\nUnion Home Minister Amit Shah said that the organization is involved in anti-national and secessionist activities in Jammu and Kashmir.\nHome Minister Amit Shah stated, “This organization and its members are involved in anti-national and secessionist activities in J&K supporting terrorist activities and inciting people to establish Islamic rule in J&K. The PM @narendramodi government’s message is loud and clear that anyone acting against the unity, sovereignty, and integrity of our nation will not be spared and face the full wrath of the law.”\nMasarat Alam Bhat, the 50-year-old chairperson of the Kashmiri hardline separatist group All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC). Currently in Delhi’s Tihar Jail since 2019, Alam faced arrest in 2010 over his alleged involvement in mass public protests in the Kashmir valley. He has 27 FIRs registered against him and has been booked under the Public Safety Act 36 times.\nMasarat Alam’s release in March 2015 stirred controversy, leading to criticism of the ruling alliance between the People’s Democratic Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party. However, his freedom was short-lived, as the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed government re-arrested him the following month on charges of ‘sedition’ and ‘waging war against the state’ after he allegedly raised pro-Pakistan slogans at a rally.\nAlam played a crucial role in organizing mass protests in the Kashmir valley in 2010, during which over 120 youth lost their lives in security forces’ actions.\nSource: Shafaqna India",

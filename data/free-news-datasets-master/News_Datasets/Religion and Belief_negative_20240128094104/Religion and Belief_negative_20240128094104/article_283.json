    "text": "by R. Cort Kirkwood, [The New American](https://thenewamerican.com/us/politics/biden-teams-with-soros-to-fund-queer-muslim-project/): The Biden administration has teamed with the subversive Open Society Foundations (OSF) to spread sexual perversion in South Asia. Not satisfied with spreading “trans” propaganda in Pakistan and South America, the State Department pumped more than $10,000 into something called the Queer Muslim Project (QMP), through the Soros cutout OSF. The money continues the administration’s relentless campaign to turn the nation into an international joke, while insulting and alienating as many people across the globe as possible. TRUTH LIVES on at [https://sgtreport.tv/](https://sgtreport.tv/) Biden State Department Shells Out Taxpayer Dollars To ‘Queer’ Muslim Writers In India [https://t.co/RBxLKVRWO1] — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) [December 26, 2023] The Grant The latest waste of tax money on sex perverts will subsidize this: The Queer Muslim Project will provide a platform to a group of young LGBTQIA writers from underrepresented communities in South Asia to showcase their work at a leading Mumbai literature festival alongside writers from the Iowa Writing Program. [Total thrown down](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_SIN65023GR0128_1900) the homosexual toilet: $15,000. The [Queer Muslim Project](https://www.thequeermuslim.com/), for those who don’t know, is “Asia’s leading online platform for queer, Muslim and allied voices, with a growing global community of over 40,000 people”: We use art, culture, media, and storytelling to challenge harmful stereotypes and norms, build power and visibility of underserved LGBTQIA+ artists and storytellers, and enable them to shape their own narratives. But the QMP won’t receive the money directly. Instead, State funneled it through Creating Resources for Empowerment & Action, Inc. (CREA), an outfit founded by two Indian feminists. “CREA is a feminist international human rights organization based in the Global South and led by women from the Global South. CREA’s work draws upon the inherent value of a rights-based approach to sexuality and gender equality,” its [website explains](https://creaworld.org/who-we-are/): CREA promotes, protects, and advances human rights and the sexual rights of all people by building leadership capacities of activists and allies; strengthening organizations and social movements; creating and increasing access to new information, knowledge, and resources; and enabling supportive social and policy environments. Based in New Delhi, CREA “envisions a more just and peaceful world, where everyone realizes their autonomy, dignity, and equality.” That’s leftist code for “we want legal abortion everywhere” and “sex perverts to have access to children,” as the [website admits](https://creaworld.org/who-we-are/) in more coded language: CREA builds feminist leadership, strengthens movements, challenges unjust power structures, expands sexual and reproductive freedoms, and advances the human rights of structurally excluded people. Foundresses [Geetanjali Misra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geetanjali_Misra) and [Pramada Menon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pramada-menon-0395a62) are “development professionals who had been working in the diverse fields of reproductive health, sexuality, violence against women, media, and women’s rights in India for more than fifteen years.” Alas, the two trailblazers spotted a “troubling lack of prominent feminist voices in India,” and so CREA was born. It’s a “a radical organization focused on developing the leadership capacities of young women in addressing issues of sexuality and reproductive health and rights, violence against women, and social justice.” Open Society Foundations, a key donor, [sent CREA $900,000](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/grants/past?filter_keyword=Creating+Resources+for+Empowerment+and+Action) in 2020 and 2021. OSF, in turn, is the creation of Hungarian communist and globalist subversive George Soros. It was [recently revealed](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chairs-group-led-effort-boot-trump-colorado-ballot-donated-biden) as a donor to the effort to toss Donald Trump off the 2024 presidential ballot in Colorado. Also [funding CREA](https://creaworld.org/donors-and-partners/) are the Ford and Bill & Melinda Gates foundations.

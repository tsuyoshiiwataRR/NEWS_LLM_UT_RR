    "text": "The Joke\nIsraelis butchered by Hamas on October 7, 2023\nIt is good, in the face of slaughter,\nto keep a sense of humour.\nThere’s nothing like a joke\nto lighten the heart and help one cope\nwith the heebie-jeebies of the day.\nAnd without doubt they could do\nwith a little lightness and laughter,\nthe surviving Jewess and Jew\nwhose ears on the seventh day of October\nrang with the Prophet’s war whoop.\n“Allahu Akbar”, explained one scholar,\nmeans merely “God is greater”\n(being Islam’s God, of course)\nand essentially denotes “a celebration\nof life, not death and destruction”.\nLaugh, what? It’s side-splitting!\nA jaunty jest brassier than a jihadi.\nAnd a US Senator got in on the gig,\nclaiming, “the phrase is no more troubling\nthan a Christian saying ‘Thank God’”.\nThank God for a gag and a giggle, eh?\nStill, they are mostly a gloomy lot,\nthe Jews, any excuse to moan and mope,\ndespite the proverb of King Solomon,\n“A merry heart doeth good like a medicine.”\nAllahu Akbar! A cry of celebration?\nIt’s a joke, a quack’s prescription.\nSo yuck it up, Jews, guffaw loud and gruff.\nMuhammad’s men are gathering again\nto help you laugh your heads off.\nAndrew Lansdown\nA Lament for Israel\nOctober 7, 2023\nWhat wondrous hate is this,\noh my soul, oh my soul?\nTo chop the founts of bliss\nfrom a mother’s chest …\nTo boost an oven’s heat\nto bake a baby whole …\nWhat wondrous hate is this,\noh my soul, oh my soul?\nAndrew Lansdown\nRinged In\nAt the airport I am reminded of a stallion\nI once saw beside the Blackwood River.\nThere is a young man ahead of me,\na little restless, yes, but mostly docile,\nmaking his way with stops and starts\ntowards the uniforms and x-ray machines.\nHe is following a maze path defined by\nnylon straps stretched between chrome stanchions.\nNotwithstanding the power and champing\nof his youth, he does not think to make\na break for it—to push against the straps\nuntil the moveable posts topple, then step\nover the jumble, lifting his feet high\nas a wild horse might lift its hooves\nto avoid entanglement going forward.\nAnd watching him I recall that stallion\nI saw a decade before we all were gelded\nby fear of the jihadis and their holy war—\na chestnut charger untethered and unyarded\nbut nonetheless unfree under four gumtrees\nwhose trunks were the corner posts\nfor a single strand of flimsy plastic ribbon—\nwhite ribbon that baulked the great beast\nand ringed it in as sure as wood or iron railing.\nAndrew Lansdown",

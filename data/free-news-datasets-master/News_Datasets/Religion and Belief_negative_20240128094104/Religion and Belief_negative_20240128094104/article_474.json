Next, we explore the recent scrutiny of London's Tavistock gender clinic where over a decade, a reported 70 children as young as 3 and 4 were referred for 'gender-affirming' interventions. Lastly, we touch on the chain retailer Hobby Lobby's annual tradition of distributing a Christmas message in newspapers across the United States - a practice nearly 30 years in the making.

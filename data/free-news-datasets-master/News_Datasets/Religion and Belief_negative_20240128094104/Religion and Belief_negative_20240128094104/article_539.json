[ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 15:00 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 15:00 IST - Country: - India Reacting to the opposition rejecting invitations for the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami said that people refusing to attend the temple inauguration never wanted the Ram temple to be constructed. Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami said, \"Everyone waited for a long time for the Ram Temple, and under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, this has been possible. People from around the world will be able to witness this historic moment. I am also one of them. All the Ram devotees are anxiously waiting for the moment.\" On Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut's allegation that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh has abducted Lord Ram he said that it was useless to expect anything from the opposition. \"People refusing to attend the inauguration never wanted the Ram temple to be constructed. The Congress party, which is leading the INDIA bloc especially Kapil Sibal have tried their best to obstruct the path towards the construction of the Ram temple. It is useless to expect anything from them,\" he added. As per temple officials, the consecration ceremony will be held over a span of seven days starting on January 16. On January 16, the host appointed by the temple trust, Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra, will conduct the atonement ceremony. The 'Dashvidh' bath, Vishnu worship, and offering to cows will be held on the banks of the Saryu River. Following that, on January 17, a procession carrying the idol of Lord Ram in his child-like form (Ram Lalla) will reach Ayodhya. Devotees carrying Saryu water in Mangal Kalash will be reaching the Ram Janmabhoomi temple. On January 18, formal rituals will kick off with the Ganesh Ambika puja, Varun puja, Matrika puja, Brahmin Varan, and Vastu Puja. On January 19, the holy fire will be lit, followed by the establishment of 'Navagraha' and a 'havan' (holy ritual surrounding the fire). The sanctum sanctorum of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple will be washed with Saryu water on January 20, after which the Vaastu Shanti and 'Annadhivas' rituals will take place. On January 21, the Ram Lalla idol will be bathed in 125 urns and will finally be laid to rest. On the final day, January 22, after the morning puja, the deity of Ram Lala will be consecrated in 'Mrigashira Nakshatra' in the afternoon. The Bharatiya Janata Party has decided to run a campaign for Ram Mandir celebrations starting January 1, in which BJP workers will go door to door in all the villages across the country and encourage ten crore families to participate in Diya Lightning programs for Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address attendees at the grand consecration event from the front of the 'Singh Dwar'. According to sources, lakhs of devotees are likely to pour into the temple town for the grand occasion.

    "text": "OAKLAND – In loving memory of Julia Ann Gardner, who peacefully departed this world on Dec. 22, 2023, at the age of 81, surrounded by her son and daughter-in-law. Born on August 14, 1942, in Columbus, Ind., to Earl and Mostella (“Syd”) Parham Hamilton, Julia leaves behind a legacy of love and warmth.\nShe grew up in Indiana, went to school in Massachusetts, and moved to Maine in the 1960s. She relocated to Florida in 1982 and to North Carolina in the 1990s to live near her sister’s and in 2023 returned to Maine to be near her children.\nShe is survived by her devoted brother, Clarence Hamilton, and loving sisters, Linda Hamilton, Kathryn Hamilton, and Juanita Emmett. Julia’s memory will be held dear by her children, Lisa Fahey and husband Rob, and Brian Gardner and wife Karen; as well as her grandchildren, Kelsey Hanselman and husband Kevin, Drew Fahey, Camden Fahey, Abigayle Gardner and fiancé Bailey Crawford, and Mitchell Gardner.\nJulia had a sweet spirit, and her absence will be keenly felt. Her deepest joy in life was found in time with her family. She loved to have lunch with her sisters and go to the movies with Karen, Brian, Abigayle, and Mitchell. She was a fierce competitor when it came to board games. She was a devoted Nana to all five grandchildren. She even took a part-time job after retiring from her work as a loan processor for large auto dealerships in both Maine and Florida to spoil them and send them gifts. A lover of music and a passionate traveler, Julia would often tell stories of her family’s vacations to Europe and Hawaii when she was younger. Although humble and modest, she was proud of winning a Coppertone Contest when she was a teenager. Julia was also very dedicated to being healthy. She stopped smoking, ate healthily – sharing her new recipes, and loved to work out with Richard Simmons so that she could be strong and live a better life. She was also an avid reader and shared this love with the grandkids. Her kind heart was never more evident than when she was with her dogs. Julia found solace and happiness in life’s simple pleasures.\nHer compassionate nature extended beyond her family, as she dedicated several years of her life as a hospice volunteer, providing comfort and support to those in need. All of which was returned by her caregivers as her health failed. May she rest in peace.\nThe family would like to express thanks to the caregivers at Glenridge Long Term Care Facility. Per Julia’s request, no funeral or memorial service will be held.\nMemories and condolences may be shared with the family at Directcremationofmaine.com.\nSuccess. Please wait for the page to reload.

    "text": "I find it amusing that Republicans have recently been falling over themselves to support Israel and condemn antisemitism. But this stance is purely opportunistic and entirely hypocritical.\nInnumerable Republican politicians have invoked the name of billionaire philanthropist George Soros as a proxy for the evil Jewish puppet master who secretly controls world events.\nDonald Trump insisted that some of the neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville during the Unite the Right rally were \"very fine people.\"\nNumerous Republican politicians have referred to the Great Replacement Theory in their speeches and comments. This is the idea that Jews are plotting to flood the country with swarthy immigrants in order to subjugate white, Christian Americans within a secular, liberal society. These sentiments have inspired mass shooters around the world to massacre Jews, immigrants and nonwhite citizens.\nPeople are also readingâ€¦\nTerms like \"globalists\" and \"cosmopolitans\" have been bandied about by certain rightwing politicians and news commentators. These are widely understood to be antisemitic dog whistles informing us that greedy Jews are undermining the country in order to enrich themselves.\nDonald Trump, Representatives Paul Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene and several other Republican politicians have associated themselves with Holocaust denier and Jew-hater Nick Fuentes.\nMost Republican politicians have allied themselves with evangelical Christians who claim to love Israel. But evangelicals largely see Israel as a necessary player in their end times pageant, when Armageddon ensues, Jesus returns, and Jews will either convert or be cast into a lake of fire.\nMike Diamond Rock Island",

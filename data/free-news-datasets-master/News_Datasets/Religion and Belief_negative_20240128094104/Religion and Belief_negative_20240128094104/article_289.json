    "text": "Who Is Satish Kumar? Lakshmi Narayan Temple Chief Whose House Was Attacked In Canada Satish Kumar is the president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, Canada. Satish Kumar is the president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey, Canada. On Friday, at least 14 rounds were fired at his son's residence. This is the third time that the Lakshmi Narayan temple or its members have come under attack from Khalistan supporters. Satish Kumar is the president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, Surrey. The attack is seen as a revenge attack over a protest held by the temple against Khalistani Extremist extremists. The counter-protest was organised against Khalistani extremists at this temple last month when they gathered to attack the temple premises. Speaking exclusively to Times Now, Satish Kumar said that the incident happened at his son's house and added that the police are investigating the matter at the moment. When asked about the possible suspect behind the attack, he said that he could not say anything at the moment. Speaking on the connection between this attack and the attack that took place on the temple, he said that it is not related and it could have been extortion. In August, the well-known Hindu temple in Canada’s British Columbia was vandalised with anti-India graffiti, drawing massive outrage within the Indian community. Khalistan referendum posters were also pasted on the main door of the temple at midnight, according to reports.

    "text": "Bengaluru: In a decisive move, BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan, minister for housing, minorities welfare, and wakf, has set a one-month deadline for officials to compile a report on Wakf property encroachments across the state. During a district wakf meeting at the directorate of minorities welfare on Thursday, Khan stressed the importance of detailed reports encompassing government and private Wakf properties, along with the status of pending cases in courts. “Private agencies are concurrently conducting a separate survey, with their findings expected to align with the reports submitted by district officers,” he added. Khan also cautioned that officials found in discrepancy might face suspension. Khan issued a stern warning to officials who neglect court proceedings or appear unprepared, stating that severe action would be taken against them. He urged officials to consider their work in the wakf department as a service to God, emphasizing a zero-tolerance approach toward actions detrimental to wakf properties. Khan also called for proposals to build compound walls where necessary for the protection of wakf properties, with a standardized design for easy identification. The opposition BJP has been persistently pressing for the tabling of the Anwar Manippady report on the encroachment of wakf properties. The extensive 7,000-page report, submitted in 2012 to the then BJP-led state government, alleges embezzlement of 27,000 acres out of 54,000 acres of wakf properties, amounting to approximately Rs 2.3 lakh crore.",

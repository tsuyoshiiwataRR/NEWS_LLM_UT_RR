A male was seen on security surveillance breaking into the temple and taking a large quantity of cash from the donation boxes. The male fled the area before police arrival.

As per the police, Pandher has also been linked to various other break-ins at Hindu Temples throughout the year in Durham Region and around the Greater Toronto Area. \"Although these offences occurred at places of worship, they do not appear to be hate crimes or motivated by hate,\" the police clarified in its press release. 41-Year-Olf Jagdish Pandher from Bramptom faces numerous charges. These are - Four counts of Break-and-Enter Place Other Than Dwelling, Four counts of Possess Property Obtained by Crime Under $5000, One count of Break-and-Enter with Intent and five counts of Breach of Probation. On October 8, 2023, in the cities of Pickering and Ajax, numerous break-ins were reported at Hindu temples in the area.

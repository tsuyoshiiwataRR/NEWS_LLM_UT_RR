    "text": "Jean-Luc Boujon / Photo credits: Ronan Houssin / NurPhoto / NurPhoto via AFP 07:32, December 29, 2023In Privas in the Ardèche, a school trip had to be cancelled for fear of reprisals. A teacher wanted to take his class to the cinema to see Persepolis, a cartoon about the Islamists coming to power in Iran. But with the murder of Dominique Bernard, the teacher preferred to back down. Should teachers censor themselves in France? Last month in Privas, in the Ardèche region, a school trip had to be cancelled for fear of reprisals. The class had to go and see Persepolis, a cartoon by Marjane Satrapiin which a child tells the story of the coming to power in Iran of an Islamic Republic. But a few days before, a teacher in Arras, Dominique Bernard, was murdered by a former student who had become a terrorist. An attack that pushed the Ardèche professor to back down. >> Watch Europe 1 Matin in replay and podcast here Concern about students' reaction Officially, the release was cancelled due to scheduling issues. But in reality, the teacher explained to the director of the local cinema that due to the very tense national context, he did not feel comfortable taking his students to see the film. \"Some of them are Muslims. They might make a bad return to their families. Their questions or reactions could embarrass me or even put me in danger,\" he said. \"We are not immune to a fanatic,\" concluded the teacher, who remembered the tragic chain of events in the Samuel Paty case, and preferred to cancel everything. A wise decision, according to Georges Lafaye de Micheaux, who runs two Catholic high schools in Privas. If the event didn't take place in one of these establishments, if things happened, it shocked him a lot. \"It's a problem for our freedom of expression\" \"It's very sad to be forced to pay attention to what you can say and how you can say them because the elements, taken out of context, can be interpreted in any way,\" he told Europe 1 radio. \"It poses a problem in our freedom of speech and our freedom of thought. But I completely understand that the teacher has backtracked: we walk on eggshells and we don't control each other's interpretations. We also have to be careful not to provoke and to be careful,\" he concludes worriedly. The teacher in question wants to stay in the shadows. Moreover, neither the rectorate nor the prefecture of Ardèche have been informed of anything. Proof of the fears that reign in the national education system on these issues.",

    "text": "The National Democratic Congress in Awutu Senya East has condemned comments by incumbent MP Mavis Hawa Koomson to the effect that she will only accept defeat in the 2024 general elections when she is dead. According to the NDC, the comments are an affront to the democratic process adding that the incumbent MP must be ready to accept defeat if she loses the seat to the NDC’s Naa Koryoo Okunnor. The leadership of the NDC in the constituency added that they will ensure that the happenings of the 2020 election where there were gunshots at certain centres are not repeated. The party has also questioned the religious bodies in the Awutu Senya East constituency for failing to condemn the comments of Hawa Koomson. “The actions and inaction of the clergy, and religious bodies within Awutu Senya East are contributing more to the menace caused by Hawa. Everyone here belongs to either a church or a mosque. We are the same youth that helps build the church. “We are the same youth that raises money when the church needs funds. It is the same church and mosque that Hawa and her people will walk into for prayers, prayers to win an election and come and beat us. And our men of God, our clergymen, our Imams are quiet. how many of us should die before you know that this woman is killing the youth?”",

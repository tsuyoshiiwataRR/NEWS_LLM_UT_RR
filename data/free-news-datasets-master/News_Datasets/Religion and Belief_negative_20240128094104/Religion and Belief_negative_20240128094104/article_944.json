    "text": "A single mother of five is fighting the Oregon Department of Human Services denying her adoption application due to her religious beliefs.\nJessica Bates, a Christian mom who lost her husband in a car crash six years ago, attempted to apply with the department to adopt children in 2022. Oregon officials denied Bates’ application because her Christian beliefs would not allow her to “respect, accept, and support … the sexual orientation, gender identity, [and] gender expression” of the children in her care as the department’s adoption regulations require, according to a lawsuit brought by Alliance Defending Freedom.\nThe 41-page lawsuit explained that Bates hoped to adopt a “sibling pair” that are both under the age of 10 and began applying in March 2022. Bates said that during the trainings for the adoption she “realized that her faith might conflict with some of the Department’s expectations for adoptive parents.”\nDuring one of the trainings, an instructor noted that Oregon law required adoptive parents to “affirm” a child’s gender identity, sexual orientation and preferred pronouns, according to the lawsuit. Prospective parents are also barred from sharing beliefs that do not promote these values.\nA lower court ruled against her and now Bates is appealing to the 9th Circuit to allow Bates to access Oregon’s adoption system free of discrimination while her lawsuit continues so that she can provide a loving home to children in need.\nHELP LIFENEWS SAVE BABIES FROM ABORTION! Please help LifeNews.com with a donation !\n“No state should abandon children in favor of a dangerous ideological agenda,” said ADF Legal Counsel Johannes Widmalm-Delphonse. “Jessica is a loving mother who feels called to adopt siblings under the age of 10 from foster care. But the state of Oregon is categorically excluding her from adopting any child because Jessica shares a view held by millions of Americans: that boys and girls are biologically different and should cherish that difference, not reject it. Because Jessica will not promote Oregon’s radical gender ideology to children under the age of 10, the state considers her an unfit parent and has deprived hundreds, if not thousands, of children in Oregon’s system of the opportunity to be raised in a loving home. We urge the 9th Circuit to allow Jessica to continue her adoption journey and provide a loving home to children in need.”\nAlthough Jessica repeatedly told ODHS officials that she would happily love and accept any child placed with her, officials still rejected her application, making her ineligible to adopt any child—even children who share Jessica’s religious beliefs. ODHS’s policy needlessly penalizes Bates and many other people of faith for their religious views, compels parents to speak words that violate their conscience, and deprives religious families of equal protection of the law because of their faith.\nBates, who lost her husband in a car collision six years ago, is a mother of five children, ages 10 to 18. Inspired by the story of a man who adopted a child from foster care, Bates felt a calling to follow the biblical teaching to care for orphans. State officials, however, rejected her application because she refused to abandon her religious beliefs.",

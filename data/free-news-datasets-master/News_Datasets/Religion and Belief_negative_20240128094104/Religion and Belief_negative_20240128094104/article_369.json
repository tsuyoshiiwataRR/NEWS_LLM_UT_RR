    "text": "- By [Vivek Raj](https://english.jagran.com/authors/vivek-raj) - Published: Fri, 29 Dec 2023 10:42 AM (IST) - Source:JND Shots were fired on Wednesday morning at the residence of the son of Satish Kumar, president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, in Canada’s Surrey. Following this, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has been investigating the incident. According to the police, no injuries were reported during the incident. Constable Parmbir Kahlon, the Media Relations Officer for Surrey Police, confirmed that the targeted residence displayed damage consistent with bullet holes. Surrey RCMP responded immediately to the incident, with officers examining the scene, interviewing witnesses, and canvassing the neighborhood for CCTV footage.

Authorities have appealed for information, including any dash cam footage related to the incident. As of now, the identities of the perpetrators remain unknown, and the Surrey Police have not established any connection between this attack and recent threats received by the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey. In a broader context, concerns regarding security and religious tensions have surfaced, particularly in light of previous incidents. In November, Member of Parliament Chandra Arya shared a video depicting alleged Pro Khalistani supporters in Surrey, expressing intentions to cause trouble at the Hindu Laxmi Narayan Mandir. Arya highlighted the vulnerability of Hindu temples to attacks, citing previous instances of hate crimes targeting the Hindu-Canadian community.

A Hindu temple was vandalised in Canada by extremist elements with Khalistan referendum posters in August this year. In April this year, BAPS Swaminarayan temple was vandalised with anti-India graffiti in Windsor, in Canada's Ontario. Meanwhile, in February, the Ram Mandir in Canada's Mississauga was vandalised with anti-India graffiti. In January, a Hindu temple in Brampton was defaced with anti-India graffiti, triggering outrage among the Indian community.

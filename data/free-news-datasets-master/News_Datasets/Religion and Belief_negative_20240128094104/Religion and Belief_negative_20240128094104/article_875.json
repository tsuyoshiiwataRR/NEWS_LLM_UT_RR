    "text": "Muslims rebuke abusive video Barbados’ Muslim community has issued a stern reproach in response to a viral video showing derogatory remarks being hurled at some of their members by individuals who appear to be visitors to the island. The incident, which allegedly occurred on the premises of the Crane Hotel, has drawn the ire of the Barbados Muslim Association, whose president, Anwar Nana, is calling on the owner of the St Philip hotel to condemn the action. In the video, a person with a foreign accent can be heard saying, “Here comes the Islamist invasion, pretending to be human,” in reference to the family, some of whom were wearing “Free Palestine” T-shirts. Nana told the Weekend Nation that a strong message needed to be sent that such acts of intolerance would not be allowed in Barbados.

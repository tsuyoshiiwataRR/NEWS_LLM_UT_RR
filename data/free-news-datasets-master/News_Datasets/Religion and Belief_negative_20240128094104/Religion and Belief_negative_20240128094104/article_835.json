    "text": "Evelyn F. Schroeder passed at the age of 96 to be with her Heavenly Father on December 24, 2023. She\npassed peacefully at Pine Haven Christian Communities in Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin. She was born in\nSheboygan on October 4, 1927 to parents Edwin and Lilly (Erdman) Lupinski. She was united in marriage\nto Robert Schroeder on June 14, 1947 in the Lupinski home by Reverend Albertin, pastor at the time of St.\nPaul Lutheran Church, Sheboygan Falls. After graduating from Sheboygan Falls High School in 1945, she\nattended the Business Institute in Milwaukee. After finishing the Business Institute, she remained in\nMilwaukee and worked for Bently Construction Company. During this time, she corresponded with Bob\nwho had enlisted in the Air Force Pilot Training Program.\nEvelyn had known Bob from grade school days. Her father owned and operated the Ourtown Cheese\nFactory which was a block away from the school. Bob’s father worked at Kohler Company and lived two\nmiles away from the school. There were no school buses in those days so Bob’s father would drop Evelyn\noff at the cheese factory until school started. After Bob’s honorable discharge (received his wings as a\npilot), she then moved to Madison, Wisconsin to work for Lumbermans Supply while Bob went to the\nUniversity of Wisconsin under the GI Bill. They got married while Bob was a senior in school. After\nBob’s graduation, they moved to Sheboygan where they had purchased a home from her father under a\nland contract. She became a homemaker and they joined the Lutheran Church of Our Redeemer. They\nboth were active in the church where she became president and treasurer of the Ladies Guild and member\nof LWML. She was active in forming a homemakers group called the Mapletts, a Braille packaging group\nat the Immanuel Lutheran Church, and did volunteer work at the Bethesda Thrift Store. She had many\nfriends and enjoyed playing golf (she even had a hole in one) plus bowling in two leagues. She was a\ncharter member of the Pink Ladies team, a part of the Kohler Golf League. She also enjoyed cooking,\ncraft work, gardening, flowers and playing bridge. Evelyn and Bob loved to travel and did several\nElderhostel trips and had visited most of the states along with several foreign countries. They toured\nEngland, Norway, Sweden, Germany several times to visit many relatives, France, Switzerland, Russia\nand China.\nEvelyn is survived by her husband Bob, sons Larry (MaryJo) Schroeder and Gary (Carol) Schroeder;\ngrandchildren Jessica (Jim) Bosovic and Jason (Andrea) Schroeder; great-grandchildren Lily and Cara;\nnephews Rick and Ken (Tina) Yurk and niece Kay Yurk. She is preceded in death by her parents, Edwin\nand Lilly (Erdman) Lupinski; Uncle Louie and Aunt Mae.\nFamily and friends may gather at St. Paul Lutheran Church, 730 Cty Rd PPP Sheboygan Falls, WI, on\nTuesday, January 2, 2024 from 1:00pm – 2:00pm. A funeral service will immediately follow at 2:00pm,\nwith Pastor Robert Schrader officiating. Burial at Lutheran Cemetery, Sheboygan will be private.\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions can be made to The Gathering Place (St. Paul Lutheran Church,\nSheboygan Falls).\nBob would like to thank the nurses who took care of Evelyn in various areas at Pine Haven. He would\nalso like to give a special thanks to their sons and family; Barbara Wagner; David Klunk; Tiffany Perl;\nKenric Hietala and for all those who prayed for Evelyn during her many years with glaucoma causing her\nblindness.\nPlease visit our website to share your stories and leave your condolences for the family at\nwww.ballhornchapels.com.",

    "text": "NEW DELHI: Ahead of the scheduled inauguration of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya next month, slogans demanding the rebuilding of Babri Masjid have surfaced on the walls of the Language Study Centre at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU).Photos of the graffiti, which was discovered by students on Wednesday night, were widely shared on social media on Thursday. The slogans appear above the name of the National Students' Union of India (NSUI), the Congress's student wing.However, NSUI distanced itself from the controversy, with its JNU unit president Sudhanshu Shekhar pointing out that the organisation's name was already present in black marker and the slogans were added later in red marker. Shekhar alleged that this was an attempt to tarnish NSUI's image and called for stringent action from the JNU administration.JNU's chief security officer Naveen Yadav said he was unaware of the incident. He said that slogans targeting a specific caste had also been written a few months ago, but no investigation had taken place. There was no immediate response from the JNU vice chancellor and the registrar.While anti-Brahmin slogans like 'There will be blood' were painted on the walls of the School of Languages and School of International Studies at the university last December, messages related to Kashmir were found two months ago.In October, Satish Garkoti, rector of JNU, said a committee to look into repeated incidents of \\\"anti-national\\\" slogans on its campus, adding, \\\"The committee is in consultation with the deans of different schools to install CCTVs in strategic locations in a phase-wise manner. The entire campus cannot have CCTV cameras.\\\"While the revised Chief Proctor Office manual has a provision of a fine of Rs 10,000 for writing controversial slogans, the Language Study Centre does not have CCTV coverage to check defacement of walls.",

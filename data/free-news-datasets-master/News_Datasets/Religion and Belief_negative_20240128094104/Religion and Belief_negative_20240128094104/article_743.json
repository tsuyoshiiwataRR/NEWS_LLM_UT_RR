    "text": "Ottawa: Gunshots were fired at the residence of Satish Kumar's son, the president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, in Surrey on Wednesday. The Surrey RCMP General Investigation Unit has conducted the investigation. The incident occurred in the early morning at the residence in the 14900 block of 80 Avenue, Surrey, as per the RCMP. According to the police, no one was injured during the incident. Constable Parmbir Kahlon, Media Relations Officer for Surrey Police, stated that the residence involved sustained damage consistent with bullet holes. In the statement released by Kahlon, he mentioned that the police remained in the area, examining the scene, speaking with witnesses, and canvassing the neighbourhood for CCTV footage. \"On December 27, 2023, at approximately 8:03 a.m., Surrey RCMP responded to a report of shots fired at a residence in the 14900 block of 80 Avenue. No one was injured during the incident, but the residence involved sustained damage consistent with bullet holes. Police remained in the area, examining the scene, speaking with witnesses, and canvassing the neighbourhood for CCTV footage. The Surrey RCMP General Investigation Unit has conducted the investigation. Officers are still working to determine the motive of this incident. Anyone with more information, including dash cam footage of the incident, is asked to contact the Surrey RCMP,\" the Surrey Police said in the statement. The officers are working to determine the motive of this incident, and the identities of the perpetrators are not known yet. The Surrey Police have not confirmed any connection of the attack to recent threats received by the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey. In November, India-origin Canadian MP Chandra Arya shared a purported video of Pro Khalistani supporters in Surrey claiming that they wanted to create trouble at the Hindu Laxmi Narayan Mandir there. He wrote, \"Last week, Khalistan supporters verbally abused a Sikh family outside a Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, BC, according to some reports. Now it appears the same Khalistan group wants to create trouble at the Hindu Laxmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey,\" as quoted in reports.

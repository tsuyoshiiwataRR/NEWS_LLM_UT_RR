She was born on November 30, 1942, in Wheeling, West Virginia, to John and Loretta Sayre. Sandy dedicated many years of her life to working in management for Hampton Inn in the hospitality industry. Her exceptional organizational skills and attention to detail made her a valuable asset to the company. Sandy also had a passion for gardening, including tending to the gardens of the Hampton as her hobby. Sandy’s warm, gentle spirit and infectious laugh touched the lives of all those who knew her. She created a loving and nurturing home for her three sons: Mark (Mary) Beaver, Brian (Amy) Beaver, and Richard (Wilma) Beaver, all of Wheeling, West Virginia. She adored her grandchildren, Kyle (Ciarra) Beaver, Lindsey (Bryan) Boston, Molly Beaver, Joel Beaver, and Zach Beaver, and took great joy in watching them grow and thrive. She was very involved in her grandchildren’s lives and was there for every celebration, injury, sickness, game, etc. She was also blessed with two great-grand- daughters, Emma and Bailey Beaver, who brought immense happiness into her life and theirs. Sandy is preceded in death by her parents, John and Loretta Sayre, her beloved husband, Lawrence C. Armstrong, her brother, John Sayre, and her sister, Loretta Cooke. A visitation will be held on Saturday, December 30th, from 10:00 a.m. until the time of the funeral service at 12:00 p.m. The service will take place on the same day, Saturday, December 30th, beginning at 12:00 p.m. Following the service, a procession will lead from Altmeyer Funeral Homes, in Wheeling, WV, to Parkview Memorial Gardens Cemetery, where Sandra will be lovingly laid to her eternal rest.

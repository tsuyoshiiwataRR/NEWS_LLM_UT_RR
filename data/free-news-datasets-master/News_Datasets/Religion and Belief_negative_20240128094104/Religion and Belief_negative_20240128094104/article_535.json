    "text": "By [Gerald Flurry](https://www.thetrumpet.com/authors/4-gerald-flurry) • December 29, 2023 Does it make any difference which days we observe—or whether we keep them? Does the Bible establish whether we are to keep certain days holy to God? Were these days given to ancient Israel only? Are they binding today only on the Jewish people, while Christians are commanded to keep holidays such as Christmas? Registration for the Bible Correspondence Course One thousand years before the scourging and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, God gave King David a vivid vision of that remarkable sacrifice. David recorded this powerful depiction of our Savior in Psalm 22. Understand the big lesson of Psalm 22. The universe declares a marvelous message of hope for all mankind. Are you listening? Discover how the creation all around you is proof of a powerful, loving Creator—and your mind-staggering eternal future. The Red Sea is a flashpoint in geopolitics today. Many nations want to control this vital shipping route. The battle for the Red Sea will trigger World War III! The great God made an unbreakable promise to King David: David’s kingly line would last forever. Stop and think about this remarkable covenant—and how it includes you. Trouble is brewing in Europe. A multinational beast power is rising, led by Germany. And Germany has a secret plan to win the next world war. The Middle East today is a chaotic mess of hatred and violence. But the way of peace was briefly restored to the region back in 1981—until terrorists assassinated the Egyptian president because he pursued peace. Understand how his courageous attempt to achieve peace teaches vital lessons about your life and future. Since its establishment in 1948, the tiny state of Israel has known only violence and suffering. Jewish attempts at peace have failed every time, leading only to bloodshed. Discover the self-inflicted cause of Israel’s deadly wound, as revealed in your Bible. All humans want to experience success—but so few know how to achieve it. Most people don’t even know the definition! Unlock the spiritual secret to lasting success.",

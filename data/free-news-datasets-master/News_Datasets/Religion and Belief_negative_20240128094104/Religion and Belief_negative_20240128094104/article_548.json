    "text": "Consequence expressed his discontent with Kanye West following Ye's most recent controversial diatribe, which included anti-Semitic remarks during a Las Vegas hotel speech promoting his upcoming joint album with Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures. Kanye's statements involved conflating Zionists with Jewish people and propagating anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about the Rothschilds. In response to the backlash, Kanye acknowledged the controversy and the resulting pariah status in the industry, stating, \"This is what y’all been waiting for. Drake, this what you been waiting for. Jay-Z, this is what you been waiting for. Cam, this is what you been waiting for.\" Kanye later apologized for his past anti-Jewish remarks, expressing regret and committing to learning from the experience for greater sensitivity in the future. However, Consequence, a longtime collaborator, took to Instagram on December 28 to address his grievances with Kanye. In a post promoting Kanye's new footwear design, Yzy Pods, Consequence stated, \"I have always lent my love, support and expertise to YE since ConMan Productions circa 2002. So @kanyewest NEVER again say in public or to others in private that you are ALONE. That’s the biggest SLAP IN THE FACE you could give to your TEAM.\" Consequence continued, emphasizing the contributions of himself and others to Kanye's career: \"Guys like me, Don C, Monop, GL, Doe, IBN, Arrow and even Virgil (RIP) have given you big portions of our Adult lives so that we could all be 'The Bulls.' But we didn’t help you become Jordan so you could turn into Jerry Krause and start playing 3D Musical chairs wit da bros!!! You can be the one with the Money And even the Power But I will always need my RESPECT. If you can apologize to the Jewish community in Hebrew… Then maybe you should apologize to a few of your guys in English. Love you bro But This Is 192.\"",

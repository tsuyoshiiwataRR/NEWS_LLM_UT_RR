    "text": "- By [Anushka Vats](/authors/anushka-vats) - Updated: Fri, 29 Dec 2023 12:05 AM (IST) - Source:JND Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday took a swipe at the BJP and RSS and accused them of taking the country back to the pre-independence era of slavery, and said the BJP ideology is the ideology of \"Raja-Maharajas\" (kings) who do not listen to anyone and where an order comes from the top and everybody has to follow it. While addressing the 'Hain Taiyyar Hum' rally in Nagpur district, he asserted that the BJP treats its leaders and employees like slaves and that the voice of the bottom rungs is ignored, citing an exchange with a BJP MP who had previously been a member of the Congress. That was what happened with (present Maharashtra Congress chief) Nana Patole who left the saffron party after questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi on farmers' issues, he added. He also said that there is an ongoing conflict between two opposing ideologies in the country. \"There is a fight of ideologies going on in the country. People think that it is a political fight, a fight for power, it is, but the foundation of this fight is of ideology, of two opposing ideologies. (Desh mai vichardhaara ki ladai chal rahi hai, logo ko lagta hai rajneetik ladai hai, satta ki ladai hai, vo hai, magar iss ladai ki neev jo hai vo vichardhara hai, do vichardhara hai,\" said the Wayanad MP.

I met him secretly, he spoke out of fear and said, Rahul ji, I want to talk to you. I asked him what do you want to talk about, you are in BJP. Tension was visible on his face, I asked him if everything was okay. To which he answered no,\" said Rahul Gandhi. \"He said Rahul ji, I can't bear being in BJP. I am in BJP but my heart is in Congress. I said, your heart is in Congress, your body is in BJP, meaning the heart is afraid of bringing the body to Congress. I asked him why is your mind not set on the party. To which the BJP leader replied 'BJP mai ghulami chalti hai' (slavery continues in the BJP),\" said the Congress leader.

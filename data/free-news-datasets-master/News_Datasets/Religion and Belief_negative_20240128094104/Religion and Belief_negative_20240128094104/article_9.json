The non-profit organisation - which combats anti-Semitism and extremism - said in a statement to CNN: \"After causing untold damage by using his vast influence and platform to poison countless minds with vicious antisemitism and hate, an apology in Hebrew may be the first step on a long journey towards making amends to the Jewish community and all those who he has hurt. \"Ultimately, actions will speak louder than words but this initial act of contrition is welcome.\" Meanwhile, in 2022, Adidas cut ties with Kanye after he made a series of anti-Semitic remarks. The sportswear brand previously had a lucrative partnership with the chart-topping rap star - but Adidas pulled his products in light of his offensive comments. The company said at the time: \"Adidas does not tolerate anti-Semitism and any other sort of hate speech. Ye's recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company's values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness.\" >> More Entertainment News © 2023 Bang Showbiz, NZCity Other Entertainment News 29 Dec: Julie Bowen's children haven't watched 'Modern Family' or 'Happy Gilmore' 29 Dec: Jax Jones thinks New Year's Eve is better than Christmas Day 29 Dec: Shannen Doherty is feeling \"a lot more positive\" - despite her ongoing cancer battle 29 Dec: Ken Jennings is \"gonna miss\" Mayim Bialik on 'Jeopardy!' 29 Dec: Tiffany Haddish joked that \"jail is nice\" following her recent arrest 29 Dec: Lea Thompson found Tom Cruise \"very intense\" on the set of 'All the Right Moves' 29 Dec: Director David Leland has died aged 82 Top Stories RUGBY World number five Gerwyn Price is out of the World Darts Championship - upset 4 sets to 2 by Northern Ireland's Brendan Dolan More...

    "text": "Jodi Rudoren of the Jewish Forward newspaper spent days reporting in Israel recently, and on December 20, Brian Lehrer of WNYC radio\nasked her what Israelis think of the death toll in Gaza, which Lehrer said is “unprecedented anywhere on earth in this century in this short a time.”\nThe Israelis don’t care, Rudoren said. “It’s really not an active debate in Israel, among Jews anyway.” They are mourning and fearful, she said– then went on to rationalize the 20,000 killed. The death toll “is totally staggering and hard to grapple with… [but] we do need to keep in mind, that the international laws of war are not based on what the total death toll is, they’re based on the proportionality of the civilian casualties and collateral damage of each attack, and it takes a long time to figure that out in the fog of war.”\nAnd therefore, “it’s on the international community to pressure the Palestinians and the Arab world to provide some [diplomatic] alternatives that might work for Israel right now.”",

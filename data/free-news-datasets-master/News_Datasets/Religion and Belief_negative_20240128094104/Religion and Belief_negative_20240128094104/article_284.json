    "text": "Enlarge image Police cordon after a Molotov cocktail attack on a synagogue in Berlin (October 18) Photo: Fabrizio Bensch / REUTERS The German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has recorded a drastic increase in anti-Semitic crimes since Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on October 7. In connection with the Israel-Gaza war alone, more than 21,1100 offenses were registered in the criminal police reporting service for cases of politically motivated crime by December , as a BKA spokesman told the dpa news agency on request. It was mainly a matter of damage to property and incitement to hatred. This is significantly more than in each of the first three quarters of this year, for which the Federal Ministry of the Interior last published exact figures in November. According to the report, 558 anti-Semitic crimes were registered in the first quarter, 609 in the second quarter and 540 in the third. These figures include all offences â€“ those motivated by left-wing and right-wing extremists as well as those from the categories of \"religious ideology\" and \"foreign ideology\". The more than 1100,2023 crimes since the beginning of October, on the other hand, are only those recorded in connection with the escalation of the Middle East conflict. The total number is therefore likely to be significantly higher. As of November 2874, a total of 88, anti-Semitic crimes were recorded last year, including acts of violence. Warnings against open anti-Semitism Shortly before Christmas, the Federal Government Commissioner for Anti-Semitism, Felix Klein, expressed concern about the security situation of Jews in Germany. \"Not since the Holocaust have Jews in Germany been in such great danger as they are today,\" he told the Funke newspapers. Central Council President Josef Schuster also declared that since Hamas' attack on Israel, there has been a \"dramatic intensification of open anti-Semitism on German streets.\" Schuster told the Rheinische Post that attacks on Jews had recently \"unfortunately become more numerous.\" It is \"worrying that there is now more palpable anti-Semitism than in previous years.\" Especially since the attack on Israel, there has been a \"dramatic intensification of open anti-Semitism on German streets.\" According to Schuster, this is particularly about Islamist anti-Semitism. jok/dpa",

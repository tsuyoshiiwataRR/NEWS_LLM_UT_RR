    "text": "Ethnic cleansing an ‘existential threat’ to Jerusalem's Armenians, patriarchate warns after violent attack Christian Armenian priests pray in the Grotto, under the Church of the Nativity, traditionally believed to be the birthplace of Jesus, in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, December 24, 2023 × This is the last article you can read this month You can read more article this month You can read more articles this month Sorry your limit is up for this month Reset on:\nPlease help support the Morning Star by subscribing here THE Armenian Patriarchate in Jerusalem said ethnic cleansing poses an “existential threat” to the city’s ancient Armenian community, following an attack blamed on Israeli settlers.\nMasked men stormed the Armenian Quarter in occupied East Jerusalem, attacking residents and throwing rocks at Orthodox clergy. Police later cleared the area, but patriarchal authorities say they are not punishing those responsible. Settler attacks on Palestinians have multiplied in East Jerusalem and the West Bank since Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7.\n“Bishops, priests, deacons, seminarians and indigenous Armenians are fighting for their very lives,” a statement from the Patriarchate said.\n“We call upon the Israeli government and the police to start an investigation against Danny Rothman and George Warwar for organising their criminal attacks on the Armenian Patriarchate and community.”\nThe named pair are accused of involvement in commercial deals of disputed validity which would acquire land in the Armenian Quarter, and residents blamed Mr Warwar for organising Thursday’s assault.",

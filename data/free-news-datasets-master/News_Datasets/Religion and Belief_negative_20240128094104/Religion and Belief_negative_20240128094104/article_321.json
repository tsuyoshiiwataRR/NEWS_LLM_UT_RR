    "text": "People Grieve the Loss of DMDK Leader Vijayakanth Chennai: The city of Chennai is in mourning as people are gathering to pay their respects to the body of DMDK chief Vijayakanth, who passed away on December 28th. His body is currently kept at Chennai Island, where politicians and screen celebrities have visited to offer their condolences to his family. After his death, Vijayakanth’s body was first kept at his Saligramam house before being brought in a procession to the Demudika office in Coimbatore. This resulted in a large gathering of party workers, fans, and the public, with fans even coming from southern districts and even from Karnataka to pay their respects. However, due to the lack of adequate arrangements to accommodate the large crowd, there were issues that led to the body being moved to the island. The Chennai Corporation has made arrangements at the island for people to pay their respects, including facilities for drinking water and toilets. Thousands of policemen are also engaged in security to manage the large numbers of people coming to pay their respects. Vijayakanth’s body is set to be taken in a procession from the island to his office in Coimbatore, where he will be cremated. The Tamil Nadu government has announced that he will be cremated with full state honors. After his passing, many prominent figures in the Tamil film industry have expressed their grief and paid tribute to Vijayakanth. Actor Rajinikanth mentioned that Vijayakanth was a man of incredible willpower and would have been the biggest force in Tamil Nadu politics had he been alive. Actors Vijay Antony, Arulnidhi, Livingston, Anjali, as well as music composer Deva’s son Srikanth Deva, director and actor Bhagyaraj, Sundar C, and his wife actress Khushbu, all visited the island to pay their tributes to Vijayakanth. Former Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam also paid his tributes by garlanding Vijayakanth’s body, and his wife Premalatha consoled their sons during this difficult time. The passing of Vijayakanth has left a profound impact on the people of Tamil Nadu, with many expressing their grief and mourning the loss of a prominent political and cultural figure in the state.",

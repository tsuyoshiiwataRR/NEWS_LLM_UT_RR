    "text": "Mt. Shasta Ski Park in McCloud, California, is facing criticism after it unveiled plans to build a 20-foot statue of the Virgin Mary on its site. The resort made the announcement on\nThe announcement, however, did not sit well with some locals in the area, with some starting a\npetition to stop the building of the Statue. To date, the petition has garnered nearly 2,500 signatures. Noting that the resort has served as a beloved gathering spot for the community where children have learned to ski, the petition stated that the religious Statue would alienate non-Christian members of the community. “The religious icon currently under construction threatens to alienate members of our diverse community who do not share the same religious beliefs. Local gathering places, whether private or not, should remain neutral spaces that promote inclusivity and respect for all visitors,” it affirmed. The petition also objected to the Statue being built on what it called “one of the most beautiful natural vistas at the top of Douglas.” It warned that the Statue would become an “intrusive religious icon.” The petition then suggested that the money for the project would be better spent on a community need such as a homeless shelter or detox facility.\nAnother criticism aimed at the resort claimed the move was disrespectful of the area’s Native American heritage. “Given the deep Native American history to that area and the long mysterious Lemurian beliefs, it would be a shame to add this Statue!! If you want a Christian remembrance for your late husband, place a plaque at the lodge,” said one commenter on\nFox News, the resort called the criticism “hateful.” “In response to the negative reactions to the Virgin Mary project, it is just disappointing to see folks being so hateful about how our owner, Robin Merlo, has chosen to honor her late husband,” the resort wrote. After noting that it had heard from numerous people who support the project, it also emphasized its status as a private business. “I would also like to clarify that Ski Park is 100% privately owned and operated. We do have a use permit with the Forest Service, but that pertains to the lower parking areas and is separate from the location of Statue. We look forward to completing the project early this summer.”",

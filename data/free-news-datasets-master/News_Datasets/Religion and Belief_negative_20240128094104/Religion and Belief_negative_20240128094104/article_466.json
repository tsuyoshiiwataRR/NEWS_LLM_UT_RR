    "text": "Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Friday, December 29, spoke about Ram temple inauguration and the opposition rejecting invitations for the consecration ceremony. &quot;Everyone waited for a long time for the Ram Temple, and under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, this has been possible. People from around the world will be able to witness this historic moment,&quot; he said. Pushkar Singh Dhami also slammed the opposition and said that people who are refusing to attend the inauguration never wanted the Ram temple to be constructed. &quot;The Congress party, especially Kapil Sibal have tried their best to obstruct the path towards the development of Ram temple...It is useless to expect anything from them,&quot; he stated.

    "text": "‘Sincerely apologize’: Assam Chief Minister Himanta Sarma on incorrect ‘Shloka’ post\nAssam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has apologised over a now-deleted post on X (formerly Twitter) on an incorrect translation of a verse from Bhagavad Gita. Taking to the micro-blogging site on Thursday, he said that one of his “team members” posted the incorrect translation of the ‘shloka’.\n“As soon as I noticed the mistake, I promptly deleted the post. The state of Assam reflects a perfect picture of a casteless society, thanks to the reform movement led by Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardeva,” he wrote on X.\nThe post, which Sarma posted on Tuesday (December 26), created a massive row with several opposition leaders, including AIMIM chief Assaduddin Owaisi, accusing him of promoting caste division.\n“If the deleted post has offended anyone, I sincerely apologize,” Himanta Biswa Sarma wrote in his post on X on Thursday.\nThe now-deleted post stated that according to the Bhagavad Gita, it is the “natural duty” of the Shudras to serve the other three castes of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas.",

    "text": "AGARTALA: After TIPRA Motha, former chief minister and CPM politburo member Manik Sarkar hit out at the BJP accusing it of creating division in tribal society on religious lines while criticising the move of Janajati Suraksha Mancha (JSM) to scrap ST benefits of converted tribals.Addressing party cadres here on Thursday, Sarkar said, “The rally JSM held two days ago was a new beginning to disintegrate tribals. The seeds of religious division are being sown in the tribal communities and innocent brothers and sisters living in the hilly areas are being misguided once again.”Slamming TIPRA Motha party for playing second fiddle to the ruling BJP in the recently held assembly elections, he said, “They (JSM) are not much different from TIPRA Motha. What happened in the last assembly elections, TIPRA Motha maintained a clandestine relation with the BJP and remained vocal against its policies in public.”Sarkar said TIPRA Motha, disregarding the attempts of opposition-fielded candidates in non-ST reserved seats, helped the BJP to win at least 20 seats and retain power. As the trick was exposed after the election results were declared, now the new slogan of religious incitement was raised to divide tribal society, he alleged.We also published the following articles recently Rights bodies oppose rally for delisting of converted tribalsCivil rights groups write letter to Jharkhand government, seeking vigilance and legal action against hate speeches at a rally organized by Janjanti Surakha Manch, an affiliate of RSS-backed Vanvashi Kalyan Kendra. The rally is demanding the removal of converted tribals from the Scheduled Tribes list. The groups allege that the rally is intended to create communal disharmony and divide tribals in the name of Sarna-Christianity. They express surprise at the government for granting permission for such a program.106243177 Party worried after Cong leader rallies against tribals delisting bidCongress faces challenge ahead of Lok Sabha elections as working president announces mega rally to counter bid to delist tribals converting to Christianity and Islam.

State Congress insiders express concern over lack of consultation with JPCC's political affairs committee and working committee. JPCC working to tap into tribal voters to emerge from shadows of JMM. Former MLA Tirkey states rally not under party banner, invites like-minded tribal rights activist bodies.

The campaign is backed by the RSS and other Hindu groups. A recent rally in Ranchi, organized by the Janjati Suraksha Manch (JSM), saw 5000 tribals protesting against the social and financial advantages received by converted tribals. Supporters of de-listing argue that converted tribals receive support from foreign funds, reservation benefits, and government benefits as a religious minority. The JSM plans to hold the next rally in New Delhi, where tribals will demand reservation benefits for those who are genuinely deprived and following their traditional practices.106278286",

    "text": "Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s social media post on the “natural duties” of Vaishyas and Shudras has triggered a massive row. Sarma later issued an apology on Thursday saying that one of his teammates had posted the verse from the Bhagwat Gita with an “incorrect translation”.In a post on X, the CM wrote, “As a routine I upload one sloka of Bhagavad Gita every morning on my social media handles. Till date, I have posted 668 slokas. Recently one of my team members posted a sloka from Chapter 18 verse 44 with an incorrect translation. As soon as I noticed the mistake, I promptly deleted the post. The state of Assam reflects a perfect picture of a casteless society, thanks to the reform movement led by Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardeva.”“If the deleted post has offended anyone, I sincerely apologize,” he added.Sarma on Thursday had posted a verse from the Bhagwat Gita which translated to “Bhagwan Shri Krishna himself describes the natural duties of Vaishya and Shudras”.He posted the video citing the 44th verse from the “Sanyas Jog” in the 18th chapter of Gita. The video explained that while agriculture, cow rearing and business are the “natural duties” of the Vaishyas, the “natural duty” of the Shudras, is to “serve” the three varnas – Brahmins, Kshtriyas and Vaishyas.Following the post, the Communist Party of India -Marxist (CPI-M) shared a screenshot of the BJP leader’s post and wrote, “We strongly denounce Assam CM Himanta Biswas’ tweet claiming that “Shudras are to serve Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. BJP’s Manuvadi ideology in full play!”All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi too launched a sharp attack on Sarma’s post reminding him that he held a constitutional post.“In a recently deleted post, Assam CM elaborated on his vision of society. “…farming, cow rearing, and commerce are natural duties of the Vaishya and serving the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas is the natural duty of the Shudras,” Owaisi said.“Holding a constitutional position, your oath is to treat every citizen equally. It’s reflected in the unfortunate cruelty that Assam’s Muslims have faced in the past few years. Hindutva is antithetical to Liberty, Equality, Fraternity and Justice,” he added.",

    "text": "In the Cathedral of Castelfranco Veneto the funeral of Vanessa Ballan, 26, stabbed to death on December 19. In prison, accused of the murder, Bunjar Fandaj, 41 years old. For the day of the funeral, the president of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, proclaimed regional mourning.\n\"What has happened is too great, it is too far beyond any pessimistic prediction,\" said the bishop of Treviso Michele Tomasi in his homily in the cathedral. \"There is no reason in the world that justifies this act, this violence. There never is. It's definitely not there in the case of Vanessa and the baby she was carrying.\" For the prelate, \"there is no sense in his brutal killing. This is evil. And we can't, we don't have the right to come to terms with evil.\" Archbishop Tomasi asked for \"silence from clamor and curiosity. Silence of memory and of the most negative emotions. Silence of prayer that invokes the consolation of the victims and the conversion of the violent. Certainly not the silence of the search for justice, nor the silence of the commitment to a civilization that rejects violence against women in words, deeds and deeds, and that finally overcomes the folly of wanting to possess a person, or of wanting to determine his choices and decisions with violence.\"\n\"We have so much anger because it shouldn't have happened. They don't have to happen again. I wonder at this point what the laws are for,\" said a colleague at the supermarket where Vanessa Ballan worked shortly before the funeral began. \"We were scared when Fardaj - the man arrested for the murder, ed. - entered the shop, I didn't like his look,\" he says.\nBunjar Fandaj, currently in prison in Treviso because he is accused of the murder, would have addressed to his partner's mobile phone and not to the victim the last communication via whatsapp, the one that cost him the complaint filed by the couple at the end of October. This is what would emerge from the investigations of the Carabinieri.\nIn the message sent to Nicola Scapinello, Fandaj would have made explicit references to the nature of the Vanessa relationship, also accompanied by a video. For this reason, Vanessa and Nicola, by mutual agreement, would have made the decision to go together to the military to file a complaint. The young woman allegedly told her partner that she had ended the affair with the forty-year-old and for this reason she had been blackmailed.\nReports to Nordio on the reason for the lack of action The reports that the magistrates of the Treviso Public Prosecutor's Office will send to the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Justice are being finalized with the reasons why, the complaint of Vanessa Ballan against her future murderer, Bunjar Fandaj, was not followed by any precautionary measure. The reports, by the two prosecutors, Valmassoi and Sabattini, and by the chief prosecutor of Treviso Marco Martani, will be sent through the General Prosecutor's Office of Venice to the Ministry's inspectorate, and also as a response to the question directed to Minister Nordio presented in the Senate by the Northern League member Gian Marco Centinaio.\n\"We will end up at the ministry as soon as possible - said the prosecutor Martani, in the local press - the reports of the two prosecutors, the one who was on duty (when Vanessa filed the complaint for stalking, ed) and the one who is part of the special group for 'red code' crimes\". On the lack of precautionary measures, such as the prohibition of approach, the magistrate said that this assessment will be explained to the Keeper of the Seals. The prosecutor denied that \"nothing was done about the case,\" recalling that a search of Bunjar's home was immediately ordered. But in the absence of evidence on the intimidating messages sent by the man to Vanessa (Ballan had deleted them from his cell phone) the prosecutors' assessment of the case had been \"non-urgent,\" as Martani himself had admitted in recent days.\nAll rights reserved Â© Copyright ANSA\nSimilar news: Vanessa Ballan, today the funeral in regional mourning - News 2 hours",

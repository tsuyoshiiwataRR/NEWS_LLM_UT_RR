    "text": "As far as I know, you cannot directly retrieve nested distribution group names with the Exchange cmdlet Get-DistributionGroupMember . It can retrieve the members of a distribution group, but it does not include members from nested groups.\nA possible approach is to use Get-ADGroup from the ActiveDirectory module to retrieve AD groups, including nested groups, and then Get-ADGroupMember $myGroup -Recursive to retrieve all members of the specified group.\n# Import-Module Activedirectory $group = Get-ADGroup 'XXX' if($group){ $nestedGroups = Get-ADGroupMember $group -Recursive | Where-Object {$_.objectClass -eq 'group'} $nestedGroups | ForEach-Object {Write-Output \"Nested Group: $($_.Name)\"} }\n4 Here's a similar discussion that shows a slightly different approach to recursively get all mailbox members of the nested groups within a specific group that might come handy.\nReferences:\nGet-ADGroup ActiveDirectory Module Get-ADGroupMember Recursively query all members within nested dynamic distribution groups of a regular distribution group",

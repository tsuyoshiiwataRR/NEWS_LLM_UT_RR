    "text": "The Seneca County Sheriff’s Office has reported the arrest of four individuals following an incident on Christmas Eve at a local church in Varick. The incident occurred around 5:58 p.m. when Christopher A. Avila, Jeremy S. Mathias, Daniel J. Watson, and Nathan J. Jackson allegedly trespassed and disrupted a church service on Ernsberger Road by voicing negative comments about Christianity. The deputies responded promptly to the report apprehending the suspects at approximately 6:51 p.m. without any further incident. Upon investigation, all four suspects were charged with disruption of religious service, conspiracy, and trespassing. They were taken to the Seneca County Law Enforcement Center for processing. The arrest operation involved collaboration between the Seneca County Sheriff’s Office, New York State Police, and Waterloo Police Department. The accused have been released on appearance tickets and are scheduled to appear at the Varick Town Court at a later date to address the charges.

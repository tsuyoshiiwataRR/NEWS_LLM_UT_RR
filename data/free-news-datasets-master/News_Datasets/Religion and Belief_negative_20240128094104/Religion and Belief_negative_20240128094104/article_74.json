    "text": "A couple of Southie churches were broken into within a few hours overnight, according to police who arrested three suspects with the help of K-9 Duke.\nThe break-ins Wednesday night and early Thursday were reported at the old St. Vincent Catholic Church on E Street, and St. Monica Catholic Church on Old Colony Avenue.\nPolice officers first responded at around 11:50 p.m. for a breaking and entering call at St. Vincent’s after two suspects were reportedly seen heading into the church with two bags.\nAs responding officers were about to enter the church, the two suspects exited the building and were detained, police said.\n“Upon further investigation it was revealed that both suspects had broken into the church to steal copper wire,” police said in a statement. “The officers located the suspects bags they had entered the church with and it contained hand tools and numerous pieces of copper wire obtained from the building.”\nSouthie men Michael Donovan, 37, and Brendan Delaney, 50, were arrested and charged with: possession of burglarious instruments and breaking and entering in the nighttime. Both suspects were expected to be arraigned at South Boston District Court.\nRelated Articles Crime & Public Safety | Top 10 crime stories of 2023, from murder to Turtleboy Crime & Public Safety | Sheep on the lam captured by Boston police officers, returned to Southie Christmas service Crime & Public Safety | Santa delivers presents to South Boston kids by water taxi (Photos) Crime & Public Safety | 2 deaf people robbed outside South Boston Burger King Then about four hours later at 3:44 a.m., police officers responded to another church break-in at St. Monica’s, which is about a mile away from St. Vincent’s.\nResponding officers to the church saw a broken window that was large enough for a person to fit through. The officers then requested a K-9 officer and took a perimeter around the building.\nWhen K-9 Duke entered the church, the dog alerted officers to the basement — where Duke and the officers found the suspect.\nThe 61-year-old Southie man was detained, and originally gave a false name to officers, police said. His true name, Steven Cyr, was learned during the booking process.\nCyr was placed under arrest and charged with: breaking and entering in the nighttime and furnishing a false name. A police spokesperson did not immediately say what Cyr was allegedly trying to steal at St. Monica’s.\nCyr was expected to be arraigned at South Boston District Court.",

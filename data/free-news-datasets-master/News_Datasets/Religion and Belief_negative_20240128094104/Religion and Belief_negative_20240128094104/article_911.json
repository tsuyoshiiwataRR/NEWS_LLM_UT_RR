    "text": "SHAMAN: Durek Verrett.\nPhoto: Frode Hansen / VG\nPetter Eide in the organization Leve reacts to Durek Verrett’s claim that there is a suicidal spirit that can be exorcised.\nPublished:\nLess than 40 minutes ago\nUpdated just now\nIn a new\nvideo on Instagram, Verrett says he will share shamanic knowledge and techniques on how to deal with suicide.\n– Yes, we are talking about something heavy here, but it is important for us to be able to protect ourselves. In shamanism, we believe that there is a suicidal spirit, says Verrett, who is engaged to Princess Märtha Louise.\nVerrett claims that one can get rid of the “suicidal spirit” themselves. He tells about a technique that will help you get this spirit out of you.\nThis technique involves, among other things, breathing and saying a few selected words to remove the “suicide spirit”.\n– Almost at a loss for words\nPetter Eide, chairman of Leve – the National Association for survivors of suicide – believes this is a life-threatening message.\n– Here he makes a claim that suicide is caused by a spirit taking up residence in your body and that you should be able to drive it out with the help of your own thinking power. I hardly have words for how upset I get when I hear such nonsense. He plays with people’s lives, says Eide to VG.\nOver 600 people take their own lives every year, according to the Norwegian Institute of Public\nHealth (FHI).\nFHI does not have figures on attempts, but Eide believes that perhaps ten times as many attempt it or have suicidal thoughts every year.\nLEVE: Petter Eide is chairman of the National Association for Survivors of Suicide.\nPhoto: Helge Mikalsen / VG\nEide points out that research on suicide shows that you should seek professional help and fellowship, not sit alone with your thoughts.\n– Verrett pushes this exclusively back on the individual, without explanation or connection – just that an evil spirit has taken up residence in you that you can drive out yourself. What he says can make it worse.\n– It is difficult to imagine him in the royal family with this type of attitude, says Eide, and points out that Durek Verrett is marrying Princess Märtha Louise in Geiranger this summer.\n– Shamanism a supplement to the healthcare system\nDurek Verrett has been submitted to the criticism, via his spokesperson in Norway, Simon Valvik.\nValvik says Verret’s content is intended for his followers and supporters who are familiar with his methods and practices of shamanism.\nThe majority of followers are Americans, not Norwegians, according to Valvik.\n– In the\nUSA, there is closer contact between alternative medicine and school medicine. I see shamanism as a useful addition to the healthcare system, as many people in America also do, says Durek Verrett.\nThose who do not agree with him do not have to follow him either, says Verrett.\nAt the same time, he says that he recognizes the importance of the\nhealth system and school medicine.\n– I respect what professionals, such as doctors and psychologists do, and I don’t try to tell them how to do their job. It’s about respecting each other and understanding that we all have different ways of helping people, says Verret.\nHe says that he wants to be able to offer an alternative to those who want it.\nThe press guard at the Castle tells VG that on a general basis they do not comment on statements from Durek Verrett.\nNeed someone to talk to?\nBy for urgent crisis assistance, you must call 113. If you want to get in touch with your local emergency room, call 116 117.\nThere are several helplines, chat services and support groups where you can share your thoughts and feelings completely anonymously, and get support, advice and guidance.\nHere you will find more\n helplines and chat services which can be helpful when you are having a hard time.\nFor children and young people:\nSource: Helsenorge.no\nPublished:\nPublished: 29.12.23 at 15:59\nUpdated: 29.12.23 at 16:36\n2023-12-29 14:59:51\n#Knallhardt #Durek #Verretts #discussion #suicide",

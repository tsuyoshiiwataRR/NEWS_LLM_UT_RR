    "text": "CNA Staff, Dec 29, 2023 / 06:00 am Pro-life institutions continued to be targets of pro-abortion attacks in 2023 following the landmark Supreme Court decision in June 2022 overturning Roe v. Wade. Roe, the 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide, was struck down on June 24 — the solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus — with the decision on the Mississippi abortion case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. “The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each state from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives,” the majority opinion in the case said. Before Roe’s downfall, news of the imminent Dobbs opinion was [leaked to the media](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251115/supreme-court-will-overturn-roe-v-wade-according-to-draft-opinion). Enraged pro-abortion activists began [targeting Catholic churches](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251169/ruth-sent-us-abortion-group-threat-catholic-masses) as opportunities to disrupt worship. Some [defaced churches](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251185/tabernacle-stolen-catholic-church-defaced-pregnancy-clinic-vandalized) with threatening graffiti, while others disrupted Mass by screaming and [chanting pro-abortion slogans](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251531/nearly-naked-protester-disrupts-mass-in-michigan).",

    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes jumped and Islamophobic offences also rose in our region in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nThe figures were obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests sent to all forces in the UK.\nThey show the number of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime offences recorded by Thames Valley Police from October 7 to November 7 2023 inclusive, together with totals for the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021.\nThames Valley Police recorded 21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021.\nThe force recorded 20 Islamophobic offences in 2023, 14 in 2022 and 12 in 2021.\nREAD MORE: A34 closed overnight after lorry comes off road\nThe figures pointed to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\nSome forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas such as Thames Valley Police tended to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences.\nJewish charities called the findings ‘shocking’, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was ‘deeply worrying’.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\nThe data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change.\nAll figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents.\nSystems and methods of recording and collating hate crime are not consistent across all forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the volume of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nCrime Oxfordshire",

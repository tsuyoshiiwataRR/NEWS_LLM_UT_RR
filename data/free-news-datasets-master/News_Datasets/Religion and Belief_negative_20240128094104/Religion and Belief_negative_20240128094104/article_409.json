    "text": "San Jose: Nicaraguan police detained two senior Catholic priests on Thursday who are close to the country's top church leader, a person with knowledge of the matter said, raising the number of clergymen detained this week to at least six.\nThe source, who declined to be named for fear of arrest, said the two priests were detained for publicly praying for jailed Bishop Rolando Alvarez, the most prominent critic of President Daniel Ortega.\nLocal media outlet Confidencial named the priests as Carlos Aviles and Hector Treminio and noted that their arrest brings to at least six, the number of priests detained over the past week, adding that two of the clerics had already been released.\nThe government's press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOver the past few years, Ortega's government has targeted members of the Catholic church, a crackdown officials have in the past said was needed to punish treasonous behavior or other alleged crimes.\nAviles is the second-highest ranking cleric in the Archdiocese of Managua, led by Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, while Treminio is its treasurer.\nAlvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa, forcefully criticised the government's deadly response to mass protests that broke out in 2018 and was convicted of treason and sentenced to a 26-year prison term earlier this year.\nLast week, police arrested Bishop Isidro Mora of the Siuna diocese, making him the second bishop to be detained after Alvarez's detention in 2022.\nMany of the latest clergymen detained were arrested because they publicly offered prayers for Alvarez, according to the source and local media, but the government has not issued any statements explaining the priests' alleged crimes.\nNicaraguan Bishop Silvio Baez, who has been living in exile in Florida since 2019 and is the second-ranking leader of the archdiocese, called for the priests to be released.\n#Nicaragua . Me indigna el injusto secuestro de tres queridos sacerdotes de Managua de parte de la criminal dictadura sandinista: P. Pablo Villafranca, Mons. Carlos Aviles y P. Héctor Treminio, pastores y profetas. ¡Le pido a Dios que los proteja y sean liberados de inmediato!\n— Silvio José Báez (@silviojbaez) December 29, 2023 \"I ask God to protect them and that they be freed immediately!\" Silvio Baez wrote in a post on X on Thursday.\nAccording to exiled Nicaraguan researcher Martha Patricia Molina, who publishes records of what she describes as the persecution of the Catholic Church under Ortega, the number of bishops, priests and seminarians behind bars in the country currently stands at nine.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 29 December 2023, 05:34 IST)",

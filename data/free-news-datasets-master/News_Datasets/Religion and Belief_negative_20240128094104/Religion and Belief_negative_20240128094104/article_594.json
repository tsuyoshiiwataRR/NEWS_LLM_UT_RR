    "text": "Türkİye, Middle East\nTürkiye nabs 32 suspected terrorists over plotting attacks on religious sites, Iraqi Embassy\n3 of those apprehended were identified as senior members of Daesh/ISIS terrorist group\nANKARA\nTurkish security forces nabbed 32 suspects, including three senior members of the Daesh/ISIS terror group, who were plotting to attack synagogues, churches and the Iraqi Embassy in Türkiye, security officials said Friday.\nThe Turkish National Intelligence Organization (MIT) identified the senior members of the terror group who were planning attacks on synagogues, churches and the Iraqi Embassy.\nIn a coordinated operation conducted at dawn by MIT and Turkish police in nine different cities, the senior terrorists and 29 other individuals linked with them were apprehended.\nThe operation resulted in the seizure of numerous digital materials belonging to the terror group.\nIn 2013, Türkiye became one of the first countries to declare Daesh/ISIS a terrorist organization.\nThe country has since been attacked by the terror group multiple times, with over 300 people killed and hundreds more injured in at least 10 suicide bombings, seven bomb attacks, and four armed attacks. In response, Türkiye launched anti-terror operations at home and abroad to prevent further attacks.\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

    "text": "Opinion\nJudge Makes Shock Ruling Over Ban on Prayer and Bibles\nThe U.K. High Court upheld a special order that criminalizes prayer and Scripture reading in front of an abortion clinic in Bournemouth, England, according to court documents.\nAccording to the\nBBC, Christian campaigners lost a legal challenge regarding the enforcement of a Public Spaces Protection Order banning prayers outside the abortion clinic. The local governing authority, the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, imposed a safe zone around the abortion clinic in October 2022.\nThe PCP Council began receiving reports of “alarm and distress” caused by protesters outside the clinic in 2017, Lord Justice Warby and Mrs. Justice Thompson, the two judges who\nissued the ruling, wrote. In response to the reports, the PSPO was put in place.\nThe petition to challenge the PSPO was spearheaded by two\nChristian groups, 40 Days for Life and Christian Concern, who argued that the order banned what they called “peaceful and lawful behavior.”\nHowever, the judges were unsympathetic to these arguments and concluded that there was evidence to demonstrate that the protests caused harm.\nStop the censors, sign up to get today's top stories delivered right to your inbox\n“It is, in our judgment, naïve and simplistic to suggest that activities of this kind in this context cannot be considered ‘detrimental’… just because they are silent,” Warby and Thompson wrote.\nThey argued that any interference with human rights was “justified by the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of women attending the clinic, their associates and the staff.”\nChristian Concern decried the High Court’s ruling in a\nstatement issued on its website.\nAndrea Williams, CEO of Christian Concern, said that the organization plans to appeal the ruling.\n“Peaceful witness near abortion centers are helpful to many women in crisis pregnancies, offering genuine choice by providing support. Whatever the guidance or law says, arresting peaceful pro-lifers in these zones clearly breaches their human rights,” Williams stated.\nLivia Tossici-Bolt, who leads 40 Days for Life in Bournemouth, noted that the group was “very disappointed by the judge’s ruling and will continue to support women in crisis pregnancies and will continue to fight for justice.”\nAbortion has become a renewed hot topic issue around the globe since the U.S. Supreme Court\nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf the landmark Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in June 2022, in which the justices ruled that abortion is not a fundamental right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.\nEvidently, the U.K., which\nallows abortion to take within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy if two doctors approve, is trending towards placing abortion on a higher pedestal over rights such as freedom of religion or speech.\nHowever, judges place themselves in precarious positions when they vow to protect one right at the expense of others. The High Court’s ruling demonstrates that, when legal issues are not concretely defined, some judges will use the opportunity to impose their own personal beliefs.\nUnfortunately, the law can be fragile in the hands of the wrong individual.\nBut the silver lining in all of this is the resilience shown by the Christian organizations and their steadfast commitment to protecting unborn lives.\nAnd historically, suppression and bans of religion only seem to strengthen the faith of the respective leaders.\nAfter all, Christians were persecuted mercilessly in the early days of the Roman Empire. Yet, they remained steadfast in their\nfaith, and within a few hundred years, Christianity became the largest religion in the world.\nSo in this instance, the Christian groups may have lost a battle in the fight against abortion. However, let’s hope that will only serve to invigorate the desire to put an end to the greatest evil of our time.\nThis article appeared originally on\nThe Western Journal.",

Pope appoints Fernandez (author of The Art of Kissing) who DISBELIEVES child victims of SEXUAL ABUSE\n“A U.S.-based group that tracks how the Catholic hierarchy deals with allegations of sexual abuse by clergy says Pope Francis made a ‘troubling’ choice in appointing an Argentine prelate to a powerful Vatican office that handles such cases.”Quoting: BOOTCAMP Granny\nIn 2019, Fernández ‘refused to believe’ victims who accused a priest in the La Plata archdiocese of sexually abusing boys, and disregarded the accusations.\nThat is disturbing, for a bishop set to have the responsibility of judging and punishing priests who abuse children.”\n[\nBishopAccountability.org said. Fernández ‘should have been investigated, not promoted to one of the highest posts in the global church’.”\nQuoting: BOOTCAMP Granny\n“A U.S.-based group that tracks how the Catholic hierarchy deals with allegations of sexual abuse by clergy says Pope Francis made a ‘troubling’ choice in appointing an Argentine prelate to a powerful Vatican office that handles such cases.”Quoting: BOOTCAMP Granny\nIn 2019, Fernández ‘refused to believe’ victims who accused a priest in the La Plata archdiocese of sexually abusing boys, and disregarded the accusations.\nThat is disturbing, for a bishop set to have the responsibility of judging and punishing priests who abuse children.”\n[\nBishopAccountability.org said.

In these pages I want to synthesize the popular feeling, what people feel when they think of a kiss, what mortals experience when they kiss.”\nQuoting: BOOTCAMP Granny\nQuoting: BOOTCAMP Granny\n“A U.S.-based group that tracks how the Catholic hierarchy deals with allegations of sexual abuse by clergy says Pope Francis made a ‘troubling’ choice in appointing an Argentine prelate to a powerful Vatican office that handles such cases.”Quoting: BOOTCAMP Granny\nIn 2019, Fernández ‘refused to believe’ victims who accused a priest in the La Plata archdiocese of sexually abusing boys, and disregarded the accusations.\nThat is disturbing, for a bishop set to have the responsibility of judging and punishing priests who abuse children.”\n[\nBishopAccountability.org said.

In the age of instant communications and 24-hour news cycles, however, a big enough crisis could put the implosion of a pontificate on display for the entire world, in real time.”",

    "text": "BBC Police record rise in religious hate crimes after Israel-Gaza war Read full article Steve Swann & Emily Atkinson - BBC News 29 December 2023 at 2:44 am · 4-min read London’s Metropolitan Police force has already reported a rise in antisemitic incidents across the capital Antisemitic hate crimes rose sharply in the month after the Hamas attack on Israel, figures from some of the UK's largest police forces suggest.\nSome forces also recorded a rise in Islamophobic offences, though the picture is more mixed.\nThe Community Safety Trust, a Jewish charity, has called the figures \"shocking\".\nMeanwhile, campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse have described them as \"deeply worrying\".\nThe figures, obtained by PA news agency, show antisemitic offences rose significantly in the larger police force areas in the month following the 7 October attacks.\nGreater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic incidents compared with 15 during the same period the previous year, while the number of Islamophobic offences dropped to 34 from 43.\nMeanwhile, West Yorkshire Police recorded 53 antisemitic offences, up from 10 in 2022. Islamophobic offences rose to 49 from 29, it said - representing the biggest increase in such incidents.\nWest Midlands Police reported 22 antisemitic offences in the month to 7 November, compared with one in 2022, while Islamophobic offences fell to 25 from 33 in 2022.\nMerseyside Police said the number of antisemitic incidents had risen from four to 20. Islamophobic offences there rose from six to 10.\nSome forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas showed a similar pattern in recorded antisemitic incidents, though with lower volumes of offences.\nHertfordshire Police recorded 17 antisemitic offences during the same in 2023, up from six in 2022, while Thames Valley Police saw its numbers rise from one to 21.\nThe greatest increase, however, was recorded by the British Transport Police - noting 87 antisemitic offences up from eight over the same period in 2022. Islamophobic offences jumped from from two to 22, it said.\nA spokesperson for the Community Security Trust said the figures made clear \"the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country\" since 7 October.\nStory continues They stressed it was essential for perpetrators to be identified and prosecuted, and that \"wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime\".\nIman Atta, the director of Tell Mama, which monitors anti-Muslim abuse, described the levels of Islamophobic hatred and discrimination as \"deeply worrying\", adding it was affecting communities' \"trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging\".\nShe said: \"We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time.\"\n\"Please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish,\" she added. \"We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.\"\nPA received responses from 31 of the UK's 46 police forces to its Freedom of Information request.\nThe research does not include figures from London's Metropolitan Police, which has previously reported big surges in both antisemitic and Islamophobic offences.\nThe force said delays prevented it from supplying full data until the new year.\nThe Met previously recorded 188 arrests involving hate crime and acts of violence in the month to 7 November. A majority of the arrests were for suspected antisemitic offences and were linked to protests held in London, it said.\nThe Met Police last provided figures on arrests relating to hate crimes ahead of a day of mass protest in London in November At the time, the Met's commander for criminal justice Paul Trevers called the rise in religious hate crime in the capital \"absolutely unacceptable\".\n\"No one should be subjected to hate because of their faith or race, and we are taking action against those who are offending,\" he said.\nSince police forces use different methods to record hate crimes, the data obtained by PA cannot be used to compare the number of offences across different areas.\nDue to the same reason, the figures cannot be used to provide a UK-wide total.\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n\"We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n\"Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.\"\nThe unprecedented Hamas attacks on Israel killed 1,200 people. About 240 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 21,300 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in Israeli bombardments since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nTRENDING Lehrmann judge’s extraordinary court order NCA NewsWire · 3-min read Water bill shock after neighbour's dodgy act with couple on holiday Yahoo News Australia · 3-min read Two dead, five critical in horror crash NCA NewsWire · 4-min read ‘Sat on fat backsides’: Katter’s flood rant NCA NewsWire · 2-min read Aussie storm pictures that shocked the world NCA NewsWire · 2-min read",

    "text": "A lawsuit accusing a Roanoke County woman of damaging the reputation of a Salem pastor fails to state an actionable claim and improperly seeks to silence political debate, the woman’s attorneys said this week in a response filed in the county’s Circuit Court. Tiffany Sandifer was sued in October by Tom McCracken, who leads the Southern Baptist CommUNITY church. The civil lawsuit, filed amid the uproar about county school policies affecting LGBTQ+ students, said that Sandifer defamed McCracken with social media posts and with a flyer left on vehicles and around the grounds of his church. The lawsuitalso alleges that Sandifer harmed McCracken’s reputation by falsely accusing him of touching her teenage daughter’s shoulder as audience members left a contentious Roanoke County School Board meeting in August. McCracken’s lawsuit also seeks damages from Roanoke City Councilman Luke Priddy, saying that Priddy was at the August county board meeting as well and defamed the pastor by saying that he saw McCracken touch the teenager. People are also reading… The lawsuit, amended in November by McCracken’s attorney, Melvin Williams of Roanoke, now asks for awards totaling $1.95 million from Sandifer and Priddy. It also asks for triple damages and attorney’s fees. The response filed Wednesday by Sandifer’s attorney, Jane Ostdiek of Roanoke, asks for dismissal of McCracken’s lawsuit and for attorney’s fees. Priddy has not yet filed a response. No court date has been set for the lawsuit. McCracken and Sandifer emerged this year on opposite sides of the Roanoke County school policy debate, with Sandifer speaking out against policies that critics called discriminatory and McCracken, a former school board member and briefly a candidate seeking a county supervisor’s seat, rallying congregation members outside school board meetings to support the board’s adoption of the policies. Among the policies were a ban on rainbow flags and similar decorations in schools and adoption of Virginia’s model policy on transgender students, which set stricter requirements for schools to deal with students on the basis of sex assigned at birth. According to McCracken’s lawsuit, Sandifer posted numerous false and defamatory statements about him online, including saying that he had stalked her daughter online and tried to “groom” her to his religious beliefs. The in-person confrontation between Sandifer and McCracken occurred at an Aug. 17 school board meeting where – in an incident not directly related to the lawsuit – an opponent of the board’s policy decisions was arrested for disorderly conduct. McCracken’s lawsuit said that he was at the meeting to support congregation members who were speaking in support of the board during the public comment portion of the meeting, and that Sandifer and her daughter sat hear him. Various comments and gestures were directed toward the pastor during the meeting, the lawsuit alleges. After the meeting, Sandifer’s daughter walked past McCracken, who was still sitting, then turned back toward him and began shouting, the lawsuit alleges. The girl said “he touched me” or “stop touching me,” the lawsuit alleges. Sandifer then told McCracken not to touch her child, McCracken denied that he had, and Sandifer said that he had touched the child’s shoulder, according to the lawsuit. Police officers then separated the group. As they did, Priddy “announced loudly, ‘I saw you touch her,’” according to the lawsuit. Other people began shouting at McCracken and continued as he was escorted to his vehicle by police, according to the lawsuit. It was after this incident that flyers were left on vehicles and in other locations around McCracken’s church, the lawsuit said. The flyers said that the pastor touched and tried to intimidate children and thought their parents would not complicate his life in return, according to the lawsuit. The flyers included a picture of Sandifer’s face, taken from one of her TikTok videos, and after the flyers were left at the church, “at least one family” refused to let their children interact with McCracken, according to the lawsuit. Sandifer’s response to the lawsuit said that McCracken improperly included other people’s online posts and statements at the meeting in his claim against Sandifer. In one example, McCracken’s lawsuit said that he did not know if Sandifer or someone else made some of the comments about him as the crowd left the meeting. Sandifer’s response said that McCracken’s lawsuit is missing other needed specifics about the supposed defamation and the damages it caused. The response noted that several counts of McCracken’s lawsuit allege a conspiracy between Sandifer and Priddy. But no evidence of a conspiracy was presented beyond Priddy’s comment at the meeting and Sandifer later thanking him in an online post, according to the response. And the response argues that McCracken should be seen as a public figure, meaning that in a defamation case, he would need to show actual malice – that even if Sandifer made false statements, she made them knowingly or with a reckless disregard for their truth. Sandifer’s response finished by calling McCracken’s claims of harm “strange and minimal” and tying the lawsuit back to “differences of opinion in religious and political belief.” “Hurt feelings arising from a political debate are inevitable,” Sandifer’s response said. Priddy has not commented on the case. Mike Gangloff (540) 381-1669",

    "text": "New Delhi: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi slammed the Centre over the New Delhi Municipal Council's (NDMC) call to seek public opinion on the proposed demolition of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid in Delhi and said he wanted to know why the Narendra Modi-led government nurtures such hatred for the Muslims, news agency ANI reported. NDMC, which falls under the Union Ministry of Urban Development, sought suggestions from the people by January 1, on the proposed removal of the mosque. The mosque, situated on a roundabout in central Delhi, has been proposed to be removed on grounds of traffic snarls in the area.\nAccording to reports, the Delhi Waqf Board asserted that they own the land on which the mosque is situated, but the NDMC claims that the government owns the land.\nSpeaking to news agency ANI, Owaisi said, “This notification violates Article 25 of the constitution which guarantees freedom of religion which is a fundamental right. It violates Article 29 which ensures the protection of culture. It also violates section 51-1A of the Waqf Act 1995 which says that acquisition of waqf property can be done only when there is no other option.”\n#WATCH | Hyderabad: On Sunehri Bagh mosque, AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi says, \"...This notification violates Article 25 of the constitution which guarantees freedom of religion which is a fundamental right...

We want to know why does the BJP government under PM Narendra Modi nurture such hatred towards Muslims, mosques, and the 'azan'? There is also a place of worship in Nehru Place which leads to traffic snarls. There is no need to remove the Sunehri Masjid. There are so many roundabouts in the city. Why is the government after this one roundabout? We urge the government to withdraw this notification and not disturb the mosques,” Owaisi further said.\nSituated near the Udyog Bhawan, the Sunehri Masjid earned Heritage III status for its historical significance in 2009.",

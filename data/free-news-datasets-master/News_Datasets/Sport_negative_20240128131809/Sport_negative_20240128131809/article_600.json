    "text": "Ja’Marr Chase Shows No Mercy While Dissing Kansas City Chiefs With Harsh Comments About Unimpressive Secondary\nJa’Marr Chase made it abundantly clear that there is no love lost between the Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals. The two AFC powerhouses (in recent years) are set to play again this weekend.\nChase couldn’t be less concerned with the players on the other side of the ball.\nWhen asked what stands out about the\n Kansas City secondary, the 23-year-old NFL wide receiver was very honest. Perhaps too honest.\n“If I’m being honest, nothing,” Chase said.\nOf course, his comments are going to ruffle some feathers among the Chiefs defensive backs. They aren’t going to appreciate what Chase had to say and will have extra motivation to shut him down.\nHe doesn’t care. Not one bit.\n“They could take it how they (want to take it), I don’t care,” Chase said.\nKansas City has quite a few players in its secondary that are of note. Safety Bryan Cook is among the more talented. Chase was not particularly kind to him either.\n“I don’t even know who that is,” he said. “Is that No. 6? I don’t know, man. Just a guy to me. He ain’t Jessie Bates to me. You want me to go (into) comparisons? It’s not the same. Just saying.”\nSAVAGE!\nAlthough the\nBengals pass-catcher was mostly abrasive, he did give some praise to L’Jarius Sneed and called him “the best player on their team.” However, it was a bit of a backhanded compliment.\nChase doubled down to say that Sneed is only the best player on the Chiefs because the rest of the players are not up to his level. He didn’t stop there!\n“That’s why they double everybody, because they can’t do it one-on-one,” Chase added.\nAnd then he fired the kill shot.\n“(The Chiefs) know I’m good,” he said. “They know how to play us. That’s what it is, but it’s not like they got a superstar on their defense.”\nWill Chase regret his harsh words? We will find out on Sunday.",

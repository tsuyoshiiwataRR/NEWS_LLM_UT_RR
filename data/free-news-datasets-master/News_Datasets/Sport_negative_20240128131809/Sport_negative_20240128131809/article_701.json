    "text": "In the aftermath of India’s disheartening innings defeat against South Africa in the first Test at Centurion, captain Rohit Sharma remains resolute in his support for the team’s batters, emphasizing the need to avoid knee-jerk reactions to a single performance. While acknowledging the team’s below-par showing, Rohit urges cricket enthusiasts not to forget the triumphs in England and Australia, reminding them of the resilience displayed by the same set of players in recent overseas tours. India’s batting unit faltered as they were bundled out for 245 and 131 runs in the match, succumbing to an innings defeat by 32 runs. KL Rahul’s splendid century and Virat Kohli’s fluent 76 were the lone bright spots in an otherwise lackluster performance. Youngsters Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, and Shreyas Iyer, on their maiden Test tour to South Africa, struggled to make a substantial impact. Rohit Sharma, however, urges against undue criticism, emphasizing that the current team has proven its mettle in challenging conditions abroad. “Don’t forget what we did in Australia and England,” Rohit asserts, pointing to recent successes where India clinched historic victories with a potent combination of batting and bowling.

Indian batsmen’s poor numbers in South Africa a worry, Sarfaraz Khan becomes must Rohit Sharma acknowledges Jasprit Bumrah quality Addressing concerns about the team’s adaptability to the moving ball overseas, Rohit Sharma highlights the importance of recognizing each player’s unique technique. Drawing attention to KL Rahul exemplary innings in the first Test, Rohit Sharma underscores the need for a customized game plan tailored to the specific challenges posed by conditions in South Africa. Nevertheless, Rohit Sharma expresses his displeasure with the approach of some players, without explicitly naming them. He stresses the thin line between showing intent and maintaining discipline in such conditions, cautioning against reckless shot-making. “We can’t just go and swing our bats. That’s not the conditions to do that,” Rohit asserts, emphasizing the importance of a balanced approach that combines intent with discipline. While batting concerns linger, Rohit Sharma also acknowledges the disappointments on the bowling front, with only Jasprit Bumrah making a notable impact. He points out that the other pacers—Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur, and Prasidh Krishna—struggled to contain the South African batsmen. Rohit concedes that the bowlers need to learn from South Africa’s disciplined performance and stresses the importance of a collective effort. Reflecting on the match, Rohit Sharma acknowledges Bumrah’s quality but notes the necessity for collective support. “All he wanted was a bit of support which he didn’t get,” Rohit laments, highlighting the learning experience that such challenging games provide for the bowling unit. In the face of adversity, Rohit Sharma remains steadfast in his belief in the team’s capabilities, urging fans and critics alike to maintain perspective and trust in the proven ability of this Indian side to bounce back from setbacks.",

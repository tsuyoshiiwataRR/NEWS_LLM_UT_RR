    "text": "Tottenham lost 4-2 in six-goal thriller at AMEX Stadium, including two penaltiesSpurs captain Son Heung-Min admits defeat was 'a big wake up call' for players Eddie Howe is crying out for help in the transfer market with Liverpool, Sunderland, Man City and Aston Villa to come - It's All Kicking Off\nSon Heung-min slammed Tottenham’s performance in their 4-2 defeat at Brighton and demanded they use it as a ‘wake-up call’ to keep their season on track.\nDespite coming into last night’s game on the back of three Premier League wins, an injury-ravaged Spurs side went 4-0 down before Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies pulled two goals back.\n‘This is not how we’ve approached the season,’ said Son.\n‘This performance was nowhere near the level we want to play. We know our mistakes but now is not the time to point fingers at each other because the games are coming fast.\n‘If we’re not playing like the last 15 minutes in every game we will struggle, and this has to be a big wake-up call. The first half was not our game and not us. We have to take a big, big lesson.’\nSon admitted it was a ‘very disappointing’ performance from Spurs against Brighton\nTottenham suffered a miserable night on a night where their makeshift defence was exposed\nJack Hinshelwood scored the opening goal for Brighton with a fierce drive beating Vicario\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nManager Ange Postecoglou blamed fatigue brought on by the raft of Spurs absentees as the reason for his side’s limp start.\n‘It’s because we’ve got 10 players injured,’ he said. ‘You can only go to the well so many times, the way we play.\nPervis Estupinan scored a magnificent goal as Brighton earned a 4-2 win over Tottenham\nBrighton doubled their lead from the spot after Dejan Kulusevski pulled back Danny Welbeck\n‘The players have given everything. That’s all we can ask from them. The team continue to show character.\n‘We lacked energy and against Brighton that’s going to cost you.’ The Spurs boss added.",

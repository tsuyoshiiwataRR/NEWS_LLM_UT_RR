    "text": "Jarrod Bowen cuts the ball back from the byline to set up West Ham’s opening goal at Arsenal\nArsenal missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League as Tomas Soucek’s controversial first-half strike, then Dinos Mavropanos’ header on his return to his former club earned West Ham a 2-0 London derby win.\nThe Gunners controlled the first half with chances but West Ham’s Soucek tapped home from close range on 13 minutes from Jarrod Bowen’s cross from the byline – but VAR took a long look at whether the ball had gone out of play from the assist.\nHow the teams lined up | Match statsLive Premier League table | Fixtures | ResultsWatch free Premier League highlightsNOW Sports Month Membership: £21 a month for 6 months\nA three-and-a-half minute VAR check resulted in the goal being given with no clear angle available to determine whether it was in or out.\nAfter half-time, returning defender Mavropanos, who played just eight times for the Gunners between 2018 and 2020, headed in a second for the visitors from James Ward-Prowse’s corner.\nWith Arsenal’s frustrating growing after Bukayo Saka hit the post and Gabriel Jesus missed two big chances to bring the Gunners back into the contest, Declan Rice conceded a rash penalty against his former side for a foul on Emerson – but David Raya was equal to Said Benrahma’s penalty in the last act of the game.\nMore to follow…\nWhat’s next?\nArsenal’s next game is at Fulham on New Year’s Eve, live on Super Sunday; kick-off 2pm.\nThe Gunners then host Liverpool in the FA Cup third round on Sunday January 7; kick-off 4.30pm.\nWest Ham are next in action on Tuesday when they host Brighton, live on Sky Sports; kick-off 7.30pm.\nThe Hammers then welcome Bristol City to the London Stadium in the FA Cup third round on Sunday January 7; kick-off 2pm.\nKonstantinos Mavropanos celebrates in muted fashion after scoring against his former club Arsenal",

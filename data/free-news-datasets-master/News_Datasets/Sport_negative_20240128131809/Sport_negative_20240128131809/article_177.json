    "text": "The Washington Commanders have placed rookie running back\n[Chris Rodriguez](//247sports.com/Player/chris-rodriguez-92062) on injured reserve, effectively ending his season, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.\nThe announcement comes just days after the former Kentucky standout found the endzone for the first time in his young NFL career on Sunday.\nRodriguez rushed 10 times for a career-high 58 yards and two touchdowns in the Commanders' 30-28 loss to the New York Jets in Week 16.\nHe scored his first touchdown from 12 yards out to give Washington its first score of the day midway through the second quarter and then again from 1-yard out in the fourth quarter. Rodriguez was the highest-graded running back in the NFL for Week 16 according to Pro Football Focus (84.9).\nRodriguez became the first Kentucky running back with a multi-touchdown game in the NFL regular season since\n[Artose Pinner](//247Sports.com/Player/Artose-Pinner-74705) in 2006.\nOn the season, Rodriguez recorded 51 carries for 247 yards and two scores, averaging 4.8 yards per carry. He ranks third on the Commanders in rushing behind only running back\n[Brian Robinson](//247Sports.com/Player/Brian-Robinson-78961) and quarterback [Sam Howell](//247sports.com/Player/sam-howell-91707).\nWashington selected Rodriguez with the 193rd overall pick in the sixth round of the 2023 NFL Draft. Rodriguez signed his rookie deal with the Commanders in May. Terms of the deal were not disclosed but according to SpoTrac, Rodriguez signed a 4-year deal worth $4.01 million, including a guaranteed signing bonus of $177, 688.\nHe already has a big fan in first-year Washington offensive coordinator\n[Eric Bieniemy](//247sports.com/Coach/eric-bieniemy-1445).\n\"This is a guy that Eric was very high on,\" head coach\n[Ron Rivera](//247sports.com/Coach/ron-rivera-3429) said. \"He's a guy that Eric thinks will most certainly have a role for us on the offensive side. Adding a physical player in Christopher is a guy that, talking to Eric and what Eric wants to do and how he wants to use him, in Eric's mind, this is a guy that will fit what he wants,\" Rivera said. \"And so we're pretty excited about being able to pick him. We had a higher grade on him too as well. So we thought we got a lot of value here.\"\nRodriguez, a 5-foot-11, 204-pound native of McDonough, Georgia, finished his stellar collegiate career ranked third on UK’s all-time rushing list with 3,644 yards and became just the fourth player in program history to eclipse the 3,000-yard rushing mark. He also had 32 career rushing touchdowns, the second-most in school history, and his 35 career total touchdowns were the third-most in school history. He also averaged 6.2 career yards per carry, which ranks third in program history and charted a school-best 20 100-yard games.\nAs a senior in 2022, Rodriguez 904 yards and six touchdowns despite playing in just eight games. Rodriguez averaged 113 yards per game and 5.2 yards per carry. In Kentucky's 27-17 win over No. 16 Mississippi State on Oct. 15, Rodriguez carried the ball 31 times for 197 yards and two scores, one of five 100-yard rushing games on the season.\nAfter missing the first four games of the season due to suspension, Rodriguez opted out of the Wildcats' Music City Bowl loss to Iowa.\nHis 1,379 yards rushing in 2021 ranks fifth on the UK’s single-season list. That season, he became the 10th player in school history to rush for 1,000 yards in a season and it marked just the 14th time in school history a Wildcat accomplished that feat. His nine 100-yard games as a junior also set a single-season record. Rodriguez' 207 rushing yards in a win over Missouri was a career-high and ranked just outside the top-10 single game rushing performances in school history.\nThe two-time team captain graduated in May of 2022 with a degree in community and leadership development.\nComing out of Ola High School in McDonough, Ga., Rodriguez was rated as a 3-star prospect and ranked as the No. 64 running back in the 2018 class by the industry average 247Sports Composite, choosing the Wildcats over Ole Miss and Mississippi State among others.",

    "text": "- Paige VanZant spoke in detail about the dangers of cutting weight for fights - VanZant, 29, has turned to Onlyfans after leaving fights behind - DailyMail.com provides the latest international sports news. Paige VanZant opened up about the dangers of cutting weight for UFC fights in a very candid discussion on her latest podcast episode with her husband, MMA fighter Austin Vanderford. Fighters often essentially dehydrate themselves to make weight class for a fight and, as VanZant also alluded to, they often starve themselves or resort to other methods to clear their system. Her husband Vanderford told VanZant that he enjoyed the process, prompting her to tell him exactly how and why she didn’t. “The best feeling in the world is after a weight loss, the next day,” Vanderford said. “You feel so, so good.” VanZant, who fought in the UFC for six years until 2020, responded firmly and told him: ‘No. TMI, TMI, here I come: every time I lose weight. I shit my pants.’ Paige VanZant has boldly opened up about the dangers of cutting weight for UFC fights VanZant, 29, fought in the UFC for six years before stepping away from MMA in 2020. He recently revealed that he makes more money through Onlyfans than fighting. She continued: ‘Every time I weighed myself, I would try to rehydrate (and get sick) instantly. So part of USADA (United States Anti-Doping Agency) is that once they see you, you can’t lose sight of them, because, you know, it’s the whole anti-doping thing. ‘Maybe you’re going to do something to mask the drugs or take something. I don’t even know. “So, I had my drug tester in the bathroom with me for two hours, while I shit my brains out.” VanZant is believed to be planning to return to mixed martial arts at some point, but in November, the 29-year-old opened up about how much money she has made through Onlyfans. ‘OnlyFans has definitely been my biggest source of income. I would say combined, in my wrestling career,’ he told Glenny Balls of Barstool Sports. ‘I think I made more money in 24 hours on Onlyfans than in my entire wrestling career. Set. Yeah.’",

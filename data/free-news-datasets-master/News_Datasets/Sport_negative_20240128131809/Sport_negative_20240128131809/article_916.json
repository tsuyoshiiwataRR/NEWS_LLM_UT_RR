    "text": "After a rocky season in which he started three games, LSU cornerback Denver Harris entered the transfer portal Thursday, according to multiple reports.\nHarris, a sophomore who transferred from Texas A&M, was away from the team the last five games of the season for undisclosed reasons and was not going to play in the ReliaQuest Bowl. He had seven tackles and two pass breakups this season.\nLSU coach Brian Kelly said earlier this month he would have conversations with Harris and junior cornerback Duce Chestnut about their futures with the program after the semester ended.\nChestnut entered the transfer portal Tuesday.\nHarris was a five-star recruit in the 2022 class. He played significant snaps as a true freshman in five of Texas A&M's first six games, but then he was indefinitely suspended and did not play again for the Aggies. Though Harris transferred to LSU, he continued to deal with disciplinary issues.\nAt one point in preseason camp, Harris did not appear in a team picture and missed a week of practice. After he did not travel to the season opener against Florida State,\nHarris started three straight games. He only appeared in two more the rest of the year.",

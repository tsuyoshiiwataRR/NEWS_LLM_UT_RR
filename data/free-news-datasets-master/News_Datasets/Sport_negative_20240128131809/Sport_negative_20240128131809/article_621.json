    "text": "Brisbane Roar caretaker Luciano Trani has refused to write off his side’s season after their horror week was capped off with an 8-1 thrashing by Melbourne City on Thursday evening, the equal heaviest defeat in A-League Men history. Travelling to AAMI Park following Ross Aloisi’s shock Christmas Eve resignation, reportedly to take up an assistant coaching role in China, Roar capitulated as City increasingly ran riot. Jamie Maclaren netted a hat-trick, Leo Natel a brace, and Curtis Good, Tolgay Arslan, and Ben Mazzeo all chipped in with individual goals for City. Roar’s lone light in the darkness was Rylan Brownlie, 16, who became their youngest-ever ALM goalscorer in the 62nd minute. “It’s been a challenging week,” said Trani. “It’s an unacceptable performance to lose by eight-one, it just can’t happen. “It’s a result that we can’t recognise in the context of where we are. “We’ve had a couple of days where we’ve moved on (from Aloisi’s exit), and the sessions were bright, energetic and positive. “So to say that the result was coming…it didn’t show any signs of that.” Affirming that Roar would continue to play to their principles, Trani said players needed to show their character to bounce back from a three-game losing run in which they have conceded 13 goals. In contrast, City are now unbeaten in seven games across all competitions and have moved into the top six with a positive goal difference. They found space behind the Roar with ease on Thursday, displaying a lethal edge in front of goal that has been lacking at times this season. “I don’t know if it’s going to be a catalyst for the season but it’s a good turning point,” said coach Aurelio Vidmar. Shrugging off the disappointment of missing Socceroo selection for the Asian Cup, and looking increasingly free of the ankle injury that dragged down his early season form, Maclaren’s efforts moved him to 151 all-time ALM goals and 100 in a City shirt. The A-League’s all-time leading goalscorer across its 19-year history, he trails only Damien Mori’s 240 on Australia’s all-time national league goalscoring charts. “He’s had a bit of a tough time over the last month but he’s pretty headstrong and continues to believe,” said Vidmar. “We try to keep things simple for him: just run towards the goal. “We got guys who can deliver the ball. “Everyone knows Jamie, he’s that type of player that anywhere around the goal he’s dangerous.” Source: AAP",

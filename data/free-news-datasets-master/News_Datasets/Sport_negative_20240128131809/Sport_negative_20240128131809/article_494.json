    "text": "Arsenal fell to a disappointing 2-0 loss at home to London rivals West Ham United in the Premier League on Thursday night.\nCzech midfielder\nTomas Soucek turned home a brilliant Jarrod Bowen cross to put the Hammers ahead after a lengthy VAR check. Dinos Mavropanos, who spent four years at Arsenal, then doubled the visitors lead with a towering header early in the second half. Mikel Arteta made just one change to the side who drew 1-1 with Liverpool on Saturday, with Leandro Trossard coming into midfield for the suspended Kai Havertz.\nThe German was suspended after picking up a fifth yellow card at\nAnfield.\nFollowing the Hammers' impressive 2-0 win at home to\nManchester United at the weekend, David Moyes named an unchanged starting XI. Lucas Paqueta looked a doubt after he hobbled off during the warmup, however the Brazilian midfielder did start the match before being forced off through injury in the 33rd minute.\nThis was the second time the two sides had played each other this season, as\nhttps://www.vavel.com/en/football/2023/12/26/arsenal/1166963-mikel-arteta-commends-incredible-job-moyes-is-doing-at-west-ham.html knocked the Gunners out of the EFL Cup at the start of November.\nThe last time\nhttps://www.vavel.com/en/football/2023/12/26/arsenal/1166963-mikel-arteta-commends-incredible-job-moyes-is-doing-at-west-ham.html won at the Emirates Stadium was over eight years ago, when goals from Cheikhou Kouyate and Mauro Zarate handed the Irons a season opening win over Arsenal.\n-\nStory of the Match\nIt was the home side who had the first look on goal as\nMartin Odegaard flicked the ball into the path of Bukayo Saka, who looked to curl a shot into the far corner, but he could only find the arms of Alphonse Areola.\nThe Gunners had another decent chance when\nGabriel Martinelli was able to lay the ball back to Trossard from inside the box, however the Belgian fired his shot well over the crossbar.\nDespite the early pressure from Arsenal, it was the visitors who took an early lead.\nBowen did well to rescue the ball from the by-line and was able to divert it back into the penalty area, where midfielder Soucek was quickest to react and made no mistake from close range.\nThere was a lengthy VAR review as the ball looked to have potentially gone out of play, but after a three-and-a-half minute wait, the goal stood.\nArsenal came close to an equaliser just past the half-hour mark, when\nGabriel Jesus played a clever ball into the box, which was headed towards goal by Saka, who forced a fantastic point blank save from Hammers shot stopper Areola.\nThe Gunners had another great chance just five minutes later when Martinelli got on the end of a stray pass inside the box, however the Brazilian couldn't hit the target with his effort.\nWith three minutes of the first half left to play, the home side continued to press forward, and thought they had levelled the score when Odegaard threaded Saka into the box with a pin point pass, however the 22-year-old's shot smashed against the near post, with the rebound going out for a\nhttps://www.vavel.com/en/football/2023/12/26/arsenal/1166963-mikel-arteta-commends-incredible-job-moyes-is-doing-at-west-ham.html goal kick.\nDeclan Rice, who made a £105million move to Arsenal from West Ham in the summer, almost brought his side level in spectacular fashion from long range after the break, however his effort skimmed just over the crossbar.\nIt was West Ham who scored next in the 55th minute though to double their advantage, after former Arsenal defender Mavropanos wrestled free of his marker inside the box, and headed home a\nJames Ward-Prowse corner - his sixth assist of the season.\nArsenal could have got a goal back 10 minutes later, as Jesus got on the end of a good cross but could only direct the ball straight at the goalkeeper.\nTwo minutes later the Brazilian striker had another great chance, again getting on the end of a dangerous cross, however this time his header flew off target.\nThe Gunners continued to search for an avenue back into the match, and carved out a promising looking chance when Odegaard and Trossard linked up inside the box, but once again Areola was equal to the effort.\nJust moments later Arsenal came knocking again when Saka tried his luck from distance with a curling effort, however it was an easy save in the end for Areola.\nIn the last minute of the match, West Ham were awarded a late penalty after Rice clattered into\nEmerson in an attempt to get the ball.\nSubstitute\n Saïd Benrahma stepped up to take the spot kick, but Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya guessed the right way to keep the score at 2-0.\nWest Ham now march into the top six of the\nPremier League, whereas the Gunners remain in 2nd place, two points behind league leaders Liverpool.\n-\nPlayer of the Match: James Ward-Prowse\nIt was hard to pick out a 'Player of the Match' because every player in claret and blue was fantastic, but one man who stood out above the rest was Ward-Prowse.\nThe 29-year-old joined West Ham in the summer for a reported £30million, and has been one of the Irons' best players ever since.\nGoing forward Ward-Prowse was the architect of most of West Ham's attacks, with the\nEast London side playing through the midfielder.\nThe Englishman is known as a set piece specialist and he lived up to that name once again tonight, providing a pinpoint corner delivery into the box for the Hammers' second goal.\nDefensively Ward-Prowse was brilliant alongside fellow summer signing\nEdson Alvarez, with the entirety of the West Ham backline putting their bodies on the line to preserve their clean sheet.",

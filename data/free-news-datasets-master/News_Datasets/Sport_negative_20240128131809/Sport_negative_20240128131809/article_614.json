    "text": "Cleveland Browns Pro Bowl wide receiver Amari Cooper is in the midst of a career-best season. He is also coming off a Week 16 outing in which the veteran broke Cleveland’s single-game record with 265 yards in a win over the Houston Texans. Unfortunately, Cooper will not be able to duplicate that Thursday night to open NFL Week 17 against the New York Jets. The 29-year-old wide receiver was surprisingly listed as inactive for the big game . Cooper had been dealing with a heel injury since last week’s win over the Texans. While there was optimism that he’d be able to go, that’s not going to be the case. This comes with the 10-5 Browns attempting to clinch as spot in the NFL Playoffs at home against the Jets on Thursday Night Football . A Pro Bowler with the then-Oakland Raiders and Dallas Cowboys earlier in his career, Cooper has returned to elite form this season. It has been needed with the Browns being forced to start four quarterbacks on the season. With Cooper sidelined, Browns quarterback Joe Flacco is going to be behind the proverbial eight-ball against a Jets pass defense that ranks second in the NFL behind Cleveland. The expectation is that tight end David Njoku will see an uptick in targets. Njoku caught six passes for 44 yards with a touchdown against Houston last week. As for the wide receiver position, Elijah Moore should see more balls thrown his way. More must-reads:",

    "text": "Already dwarfed by a traditionally strong pro sports market, the California Golden Bears men's basketball program gradually drained the life out of Haas Pavilion by averaging only nine wins over the past six seasons.\nEven when Arizona (9-2) has shown up to play Cal (4-7) in recent seasons, the place has sometimes still had more empty seats than filled ones. And that‚Äôs thanks partly to Bay area-based UA fans who aren‚Äôt likely to show up anytime in the foreseeable future after Friday, with the Wildcats off to the Big 12 and the Bears headed to the ACC next season.\nLast season, when the Bears muddled through a dreary 3-29 season, they averaged just 2,155 fans. That left over four-fifths of Haas Pavilion‚Äôs 11,877 seats empty.\nBut that‚Äôs not the memory forward Keshad Johnson, now with No. 4 Arizona, has of Cal‚Äôs venerable on campus arena, once known as Harmon Gym and renovated extensively before the 1999-200 season.\n A list of places that will be open on Christmas Day 2023 Rainy day in Tucson sets record, storm to be gone by Christmas Eve Meet the Tucson man who saved Barbie You have 72 hours in Tucson. Here's what you should do. Five Tucson Unified 'D' schools struggle to fill teaching jobs 46 fun events happening in Tucson this weekend Dec. 28-31 üåÆüé∂ Tucson Arizona, California, Nevada near long-term deal to use less Colorado River water Johnson was a high school freshman from Oakland when Jaylen Brown and local standout Ivan Rabb helped lead the Bears to 23 wins ‚Äî including their last one over Arizona ‚Äî and a No. 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament during the 2015-16 season.\nArizona forward Lauri Markkanen (10) fights his way inside of California forward Ivan Rabb (1) during the first half of the No. 18 Wildcats' 67-62 win over the Golden Bears on Dec. 30, 2016 at Haas Pavilion in Berkeley, California.\nMike Christy, Arizona Daily Star 2016 Brown, now a Boston Celtics star who signed a contract making him the highest-paid player in NBA history last summer, took off for the NBA Draft after that season but Rabb returned to lead the Bears to another 21 wins in 2016-17.\nThe place was jumping. Haas averaged 10,183 fans a game in 2015-16 and 9,307 the next season.\n‚ÄúAround the Jaylen Brown and Ivan Rabb years, I was getting to a lot of games,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúIvan Rabb was one of the hometown heroes. I looked up to him. I loved that team.‚Äù\nJohnson said he wanted to be the next local hero. But the Bears, coached in those high-achieving years by Cuonzo Martin and later by Wyking Jones and Mark Fox, never called.\n‚ÄúThey never really recruited me,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúThat was that was always my dream school until I started getting recruited‚Äù by other schools.\nWhile Johnson played his early high school years just six miles away at Oakland‚Äôs Envision Academy, the charter school‚Äôs low profile helped keep Johnson off the high-major college radar.\nArizona Wildcats forward Keshad Johnson (16) goes up to block a dunk attempt by Alabama forward Nick Pringle (23) in the second half of the Wildcats' win over the Crimson Tide on Dec. 20 in Phoenix.\nKelly Presnell, Arizona Daily Star But after leading Envision to the Class V CIF playoffs as a junior in 2018, Johnson joined a high-level club teams, Johnson transferred to San Leandro High School as a senior. Rated a three-star prospect by most major recruiting services at that point, Johnson accepted a scholarship offer at San Diego State and grew into a starter on an Aztecs team that played in the national championship game last season.\nJohnson and reserve center Demarshay Johnson repped Oakland in Aztecs uniforms last season. That was how he could do it.\n‚ÄúJust supporting from a distance,‚Äù Johnson says.\nUntil Friday. Johnson will play a college game for the first time at Haas Pavilion. He‚Äôll be wearing another visitor uniform, Arizona‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs still a moment Johnson is looking forward to.\n‚ÄúIt's an honor to finally play at Cal Berkeley,‚Äù Johnson said Wednesday. ‚ÄúIt's always been a dream to just play there. It‚Äôs just a honor to be able to play in front of the hometown and have all my people come out and support me.‚Äù\nJohnson said he expects more than 20 friends and family on hand, including his brother Kenny, who was shot as a 14-year-old eighth grader in Oakland when Keshad was 10.\nNudged by Kenny‚Äôs middle-school coach during an Oakland YMCA game, Keshad picked up his brother‚Äôs No. 16 jersey and wears the same number today for Arizona in Kenny‚Äôs honor, since an NCAA rule change this season now allows numbers greater than five.\nThere are so many friends and family that Keshad said he can‚Äô‚Äôt get all of them on free passes.\n‚ÄúA lot of them are paying their own way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs real, true support.‚Äù\nJohnson‚Äôs anticipation could add a spark to an Arizona team that will begin its final Pac-12 go-round at a site that could as quiet as any place the Wildcats have played so far this season.\nBut Johnson downplayed that notion.\n‚ÄúIt's nothing more than just in playing in your hometown,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúI'm sure wherever wherever else we go, whether it's in a tournament and we go to somebody else‚Äôs hometown like Texas, KJ (Lewis, of El Paso and Dallas) is gonna love Texas with his people out there and things like that.\nArizona will face Cal at Haas Pavilion in Berkeley, California, for the last time as Pac-12 foes Friday. While the Golden Bears have been near the bottom of the conference in recent years, Arizona has played memorable games at Haas in the past, for better and worse. One that still stings many Wildcat fans today: Feb. 1, 2014, No. 1 Arizona, at 21-0 overall, fell 60-58 to the Golden Bears at Haas. Even worse, forward Brandon Ashley suffered a season-ending foot injury that made the Wildcats' national championship aspirations all that more difficult.\nMamta Popat, Arizona Daily Star 2014 ‚ÄúSo it's nothing extra to it. It's just getting to play in front of my family. A lot of people are not able to travel to Arizona. So the fact that we're coming out there and they can see me for the first time, that's a blessing.‚Äù\nBut it‚Äôs personal, at least. It‚Äôs a big game for Arizona because it‚Äôs a Pac-12 game and it‚Äôs a big game for Johnson because it‚Äôs a Pac-12 game that's being played at Haas Pavilion.\nJohnson won't be wearing the same uniform that Ivan Rabb did, but he‚Äôll be playing in the same spot, representing the same Oakland hometown.\nCal‚Äôs success with Rabb was ‚Äúpretty much the reason why I wanted to support my city‚Äù as a Cal player, Johnson said. \"But right now I'm just doing it from a distance, going to San Diego State and being here at Arizona‚Ä¶\n\"It is what it is. I‚Äôm here in the right place, right now.‚Äù\nPac-12 Opener Who : No. 4 Arizona (9-2) at Cal (4-7)\nWhen : 8:30 p.m. Friday\nWhere : Haas Pavilion; Berkeley, Calif.\nTV : Pac-12 Networks\nRadio : 1290-AM, 107.5-FM",

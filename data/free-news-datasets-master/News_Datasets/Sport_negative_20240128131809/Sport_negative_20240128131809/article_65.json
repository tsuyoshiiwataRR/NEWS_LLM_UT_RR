    "text": "On Thursday's episode of The Paul Finebaum Show , Finebaum was asked by a caller about the possibility of Nick Saban retiring, taking a year off, and then becoming head coach of the Florida Gators. \"No, is there some reason why you do? Well, I don't know what Saban's going to do, but I think Billy Napier had better do something.\n\"I appreciate your optimism for the future of Florida. I don't really have much optimism right now because. I don't think people realize how truly bad that program is at the moment in terms of what it just got through losing and what it barely was able to hold on to and what I don't understand is the reason. We've talked to Napier a million times and he seems well organized. He seems like he finally has everything going from an infrastructure standpoint. He just can't seem to get it done.\n\"A year ago Missouri was looking pretty desperate. But somehow, some way, they jumped out, got the right players in there, and had a huge year. It can happen. I still believe that Florida has enough going for it that they can do more sometimes than maybe your average program, but it looks pretty bad right now.\" Florida ended this season with a disappointing 5-7 (3-5 SEC) record under head coach Billy Napier. The Gators did not qualify for a bowl game for the first time since 2017. Napier is 11-14 over his first two seasons with the Gators and both seasons have ended with losing records. The Gators lost the Las Vegas Bowl last season to Oregon State, which dropped Florida to 6-7 for the season. Many experts believe that Napier could be entering his final season in Gainesville if the 44-year-old head coach does not compete in the SEC. The Gators also have one of the most difficult schedules in the country , which will add even more pressure to Napier and the Florida program.",

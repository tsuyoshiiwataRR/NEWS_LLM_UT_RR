    "text": "While Mitch Marsh came to Australia 's rescue with a heroic knock on day three of the second Test against Pakistan, he also continued a family tradition they would rather not have. Australia headed to the MCG on day four of the second Test with a lead of 241, largely thanks to Marsh's sparkling 96 amid a barrage of Pakistani swing bowling. Marsh joined Steve Smith when Australia were reeling at 4-16 on Thursday, but their 153-run stand has likely batted Pakistan out of the match on a wearing pitch. The 32-year-old kept a close eye on his family, including Shaun, in the stands throughout the innings and noted his famous cricket-playing father Geoff 'moved an inch' when he reached 70. 'I could sense his nerves, but that's the Marsh way,' he said. Mitch Marsh fell just short of a Boxing Day Test ton at the MCG after he was dismissed for 96 against Pakistan His brother Shaun Marsh was run out on 99 in the Boxing Day Test in 2014 to continue the family legacy It all started with their father Geoff Marsh, who batted well to reach 86 against England in the 1991 Boxing Day Test but could not go on with it Those nerves were well placed, with Marsh unfortunately falling just short of his ton on 96. It comes after his brother Shaun Marsh was run out on 99 against India in the Boxing Day Test in 2014 while Geoff also fell just short on 86 in 1991. '(Falling for 96 was) obviously disappointing ... I thought we navigated our way out of a tricky situation to get a partnership with Smudge (Smith), and I guess there's a lot of history at this ground, the Boxing Day Test, and a bloody big honours board that I was close to getting on, but it wasn't meant to be,' Marsh said. 'Shaun got run out for 99 and Dad got 86 here, so Shaun's technically still got me ... hopefully I get one more crack at it.' Geoff and Shaun Marsh were both in the stands watching Mitch bat, along with his wife Greta Mack Marsh rode his luck with his trademark swashbuckling style at the MCG in the rescue mission for Australia Marsh said there was plenty going through his mind coming out with Australia in big trouble and questioned whether he should back his swashbuckling style or not. 'There's a lot of voices inside your head at four for 16,' Marsh said. 'I think it just comes back to ... knowing how to play my best, to get on the counter-attack and be positive in that situation ... getting myself in and then playing the way I have for the last six months. 'My strength is hitting down the ground, but I felt like every time I was trying to do that I was either going to get thumped on the pad or nick off, so I sort of changed my game a little bit to really hit square of the wicket and hit squarish cover drives instead of trying to beat mid-off.' Pakistan bowler Mir Hamza celebrates taking the prized wicket of Mitch Marsh to keep his side in the Test match Marsh will back Australia in to defend any total against Pakistan after the allrounder steered the hosts out of major trouble in the Boxing Day Test. The last team to score more than 300 in the fourth innings of an MCG Test was Pakistan in a losing cause back in 1990. 'It felt like really hard work, the ball was swinging around and Shaheen had his tail up - we know that he's world-class,' he said. 'I still felt even on 96 that I could nick one, and I did - there's still plenty in the wicket ... for us to get in a position where we're 240 ahead, we're very happy. 'I think that if we were all out now we'd feel very much in the game ... I don't necessarily want to put a number on it for our bowlers, but we know that they can certainly hold a bat so a couple of good partnerships with some tired bowlers now, hopefully we can get up towards the 300 mark.'",

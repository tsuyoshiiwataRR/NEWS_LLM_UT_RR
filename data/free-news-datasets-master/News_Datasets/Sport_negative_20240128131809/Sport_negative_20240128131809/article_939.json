    "text": "2023-12-28 22:37:16 Published28. December 2023, 11:37 p.m. Football: Arsenal receives a lesson in efficiency and lets go of first place The Gunners were surprised at home by a lethal West Ham (0-2), at the end of the 19th day of the Premier League. They remain 2nd, two points behind Liverpool. West Ham thwarted the plans of Martin Odegaard (No 8), Gabriel Jesus (foreground) and their teammates. Imago Liverpool remains on the throne of the Premier League after the poor performance of its now runner-up, Arsenal, beaten at the Emirates Stadium by West Ham (0-2) on Thursday at the conclusion of a 19th day which saw three of the five lose leading teams. In addition to the Gunners, Tottenham was beaten at Brighton (4-2) while the 3rd, Aston Villa, gave in at the end of the match on Tuesday to Manchester United (3-2). Five days after hanging the Reds at Anfield Road (1-1), Arsenal unexpectedly gave in to the team that eliminated them from the League Cup at the beginning of November. The Hammers proved the analysis of their coach David Moyes right, who assured before the match that this year was the best in the clubâ€™s history, including a triumph in the Europa Conference League. Benrahma misses a penalty They did not concede the slightest opportunity in the first half hour of play, and even scored shortly before the quarter of an hour after a poor assessment by Gabriel Magalhaes, which benefited Tomas Soucek (0-1, 13th). The former Lille defender also lost a decisive aerial duel in the second half against Konstantinos Mavropanos, following a corner from Ward-Prowse (2-0, 55th). Often effective in front of goal since the start of the season, the Gunners this time lacked realism with Saka (30th, 42nd), Martinelli (37th), Gabriel Jesus (66th) then Trossard in the last quarter of an hour. The score could have been crueler if Benrahma had converted his penalty in added time. The successive entries into play of Nketiah, Nelson and Smith Rowe reminded us of the lack of bench depth available to Mikel Arteta. Arsenal are 3 points behind Liverpool while West Ham (6th) is on the lookout for European places, 3 points from Tottenham and 4 from Manchester City, winner Tuesday at Everton (1-3) and who have a match of more to argue about. Tottenham relapses heavily Shortly before, Tottenham had suffered a severe relapse on the Brighton pitch (4-2) and missed the opportunity to get closer to the lead in the championship. However, Tottenham were the best away team before this meeting and ended the first half of the season on a negative note, despite a good 5th place in the standings, one point behind Manchester City. Better in recent weeks after a catastrophic month of November in terms of results, the Spurs showed an unusual face with a lot of passivity, as in this individual action by Joao Pedro who was able to review four players and give away a golden ball to Jack Hinshelwood, unmarked at the entrance to the penalty area (1-0, 11th). Between several clear chances for Brighton (17th, 32nd, 45th), the same Joao Pedro would then convert two penalties (23rd, 75th), with in the meantime a powerful strike from Pervis Estupinan in the opposite corner of Vicario (63rd). Alejo Veliz (81st) and Ben Davies (85th) reduced the score, too late to put the Seagulls in doubt. Brighton repositions itself in 8th place, 6 points behind first European place.

    "text": "[Jimmy Watson](/staff/4406697002/jimmy-watson/) Bobby Ray Tell, one of the most prolific running backs in Haynesville and Louisiana Tech history, has died, according to a family member. The baby of seven children in his family, the 46-year-old Tell led Haynesville to three consecutive LHSAA state titles in 1993, 1994 and 1995. He died of unknown causes at approximately 4 p.m. Wednesday at his sister’s house in Haynesville. An autopsy has been ordered, according to his sister-in-law, Connie Tell. “Definitely one of the best high school running backs to ever play the game,” said Haynesville coach David Franklin. “He was extremely strong, had great balance and vision and was as quick as a cat. He never really said a lot. He just played the game and played it very well.” Funeral arrangements have been set for 11 a.m. Thursday in the Haynesville Junior/Senior High School auditorium under the direction of Memorial Funeral Home of Homer, where flowers and memories can be sent. Burial will be at Bethel Missionary Baptist Cemetery with a repast at the Haynesville Community Center (formerly AARP) near Red Franklin Memorial Stadium. After his stellar high school career, Tell signed with Louisiana Tech and became one of the school’s Top-5 all-time running backs. In four seasons, he accumulated nearly 3,000 rushing and receiving yards with 25 TDs while also returning punts and kickoffs. He shared two seasons with John Simon. “Bobby Ray was a great teammate,” Simon said. “He never complained, always had a smile and was the team’s favorite.” Connie Tell said Bobby Ray was the father of 12-year-old twin girls, A’lajah and Brajah Tell. “Bobby Ray was the ultimate girl-dad,” Tell said. “His girls played on a flag football team and won a title. He couldn’t have been more excited.” Tell was currently living in Haynesville with his mother, assisting her with day-to-day needs. “Everybody loved Bobby Ray, and he wouldn’t let anyone outdo him,” Connie Tell said. “He was the life of the party and enjoyed being the center of attention.” Funeral arrangements are expected to be completed Friday.

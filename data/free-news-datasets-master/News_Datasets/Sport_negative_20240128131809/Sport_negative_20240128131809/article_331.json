    "text": "The Kansas City Chiefs are not having a good second half of the season.\nThey’ve lost four of their past six games since their Week 10 bye, including an ugly Week 16 defeat at the hands of the Las Vegas Raiders.\nWhile the defense has played solid over this span, the offense has actually been the side that’s doomed the Chiefs.\nKansas City has scored more than 20 points just twice since Week 10 – both were in wins over teams below .500 – and the offense has turned the ball over nine times during that stretch.\nThese offensive issues are troubling, and Skip Bayless doesn’t think the Chiefs can correct it in time to save their season, via “Undisputed.”\n.\n[@RealSkipBayless]on whether the Chiefs can overcome their offensive struggles:\n“You can yell and scream all you want, but sometimes you can see the handwriting on the wall. It’s not fixable…Travis Kelce is feeling that.”\n[pic.twitter.com/cs05yw5lFr]\n— UNDISPUTED (@undisputed)\n[December 28, 2023]\nThe main issue here isn’t quarterback Patrick Mahomes, but who the Chiefs have surrounded him with this year.\nTight end Travis Kelce remains the only truly reliable pass-catcher on the team, and he’s having a down season (by his standards, anyway) with 90 receptions for 958 yards and only five touchdowns.\nThe next-best option for Mahomes is rookie Rashee Rice, who has 74 receptions for 811 yards and seven touchdowns.\nAfter that, the most-targeted players on the Chiefs are running back Isiah Pacheco and wide receivers Kadarius Toney and Justin Watson.\nThis is an unsustainable situation for Kansas City, and one that that threatens to seriously jeopardy the Chiefs’ chances to defend their Super Bowl crown.\nAnd with it being so late in the season, there really isn’t a wholesale change that could help the team return to form before the postseason.\nNEXT: Fans React To Eric Bieniemy's Comments On Sam Howell's Benching",

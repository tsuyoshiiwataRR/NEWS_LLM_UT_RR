    "text": "Northwestern head coach David Braun has dismissed offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian, special teams coach Jeff Genyk and director of sports performance Jay Hooten, according to Matt Fortuna of The Inside Zone.\nCoaching staff moves were expected since Braun signed a five-year deal to become the program's permanent head coach in November. Furthermore, ESPN's Sean McDonough reported during the Las Vegas Bowl broadcast last Friday that there could be as many as five Wildcat coaching changes, including Bajakian.\nThe three dismissals mean that two more moves may still be coming. A source told WildcatReport that offensive line coach Kurt Anderson may be close to landing another job and could follow Bajakian, Genyk and Hooten out the door.\nBraun also has to hire a defensive coordinator since he is relinquishing DC duties after holding both positions this season. Linebackers coach Tim McGarigle is seen as a strong candidate to be elevated to that role, sources say.\nContent Loading Embed content not available\nManage privacy settings PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nc3RfX2NvbnRlbnQtYmxvY2sgc3RfX2NvbnRlbnQtYmxv Y2stLXR3ZWV0Jz4KPGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY2VudGVyX3R3ZWV0Jz48YmxvY2tx dW90ZSBjbGFzcz0idHdpdHRlci10d2VldCI+PHAgbGFuZz0iZW4iIGRpcj0i bHRyIj5Tb3VyY2VzOiBOb3J0aHdlc3Rlcm4gaGFzIHBhcnRlZCB3YXlzIHdp dGggT0MgTWlrZSBCYWpha2lhbiwgc3BlY2lhbCB0ZWFtcyBjb29yZGluYXRv ci9URXMgY29hY2ggSmVmZiBHZW55ayBhbmQgZGlyZWN0b3Igb2Ygc3BvcnRz IHBlcmZvcm1hbmNlIGZvciBmb290YmFsbCBKYXkgSG9vdGVuLiA8YSBocmVm PSJodHRwczovL3QuY28vZnhuZ00zbDh3ayI+aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvL2Z4bmdN M2w4d2s8L2E+PC9wPiZtZGFzaDsgTWF0dCBGb3J0dW5hIChATWF0dF9Gb3J0 dW5hKSA8YSBocmVmPSJodHRwczovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tL01hdHRfRm9ydHVu YS9zdGF0dXMvMTc0MDQ4NTE5NzcxODc1NzY3ND9yZWZfc3JjPXR3c3JjJTVF dGZ3Ij5EZWNlbWJlciAyOCwgMjAyMzwvYT48L2Jsb2NrcXVvdGU+CjxzY3Jp cHQgYXN5bmMgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3BsYXRmb3JtLnR3aXR0ZXIuY29tL3dp ZGdldHMuanMiIGNoYXJzZXQ9InV0Zi04Ij48L3NjcmlwdD4KCjwvZGl2Pgo8 L2Rpdj4KCg== Bajakian, who doubled as the program's quarterbacks coach, had a rocky four-year tenure in Evanston. The Wildcats never finished higher than 93rd in the nation in scoring, and that came in 2020, his first year in the job, when the Wildcats won the Big Ten West.\nThe offense’s points per game dropped to 16.6 (125th) and 13.8 (128th) in 2021 and 2022, respectively. This year, the Wildcats' scoring improved by more than a touchdown, but their 22.8 points per game average still ranked just 104th nationally.\nGenyk had been with Northwestern since 2018 in his second stint in Evanston; he was also on the Wildcat staff from 1994-2003. Genyk coached both tight ends and special teams for the last six seasons.\nHooten joined the Northwestern strength and conditioning staff in 2009 and was promoted to his current director role in 2011.\nAll three coaches were hired by previous head coach Pat Fitzgerald, who was fired in July in the wake of a hazing scandal.\nOne potential candidate to replace Bajakian as offensive coordinator is Tyler Roehl of North Dakota State, multiple sources have told WildcatReport. Roehl has held the offensive coordinator role since 2019 in Fargo, where he was on staff with Braun.\ntrending {{ article.title }} premium-icon\n{{ timeAgo(article.live_at) }}",

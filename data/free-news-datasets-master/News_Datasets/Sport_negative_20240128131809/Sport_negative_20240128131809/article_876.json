    "text": "Former Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi rekindled the debate surrounding pacer Haris Rauf and his participation in BBL 2023 instead of the PAK vs AUS Tests. Earlier in December, the PCB had given a NOC to the fiery pacer to play in the BBL after he had decided to pull out of the Test series against Australia. PAK vs AUS: Afridi wants Rauf in whites Speaking at the MCG, Shahid Afridi said that Rauf should have played the Test series instead of BBL 2023. The former cricketer highlighted that the pacer would have performed well in the conditions, given the speed he possesses. Further, Afridi claimed that Rauf would have enjoyed himself on the pitches that were prepared by Australia in Perth and Melbourne. “I think Haris [Rauf] should be part of this side instead rather than [the BBL],” Afridi, speaking to media at the MCG, said.” In these conditions, the kind of pace he has, he would have performed well and enjoyed himself on the kinds of pitches Australia prepared in Perth and here.” Also Read: Final Frontier remains unconquered Ajinkya Rahane & Cheteshwar Pujara could have been game-changers in South Africa SKY out, Hardik out, Rohit not interested, Who will lead India in Afghanistan T20Is?

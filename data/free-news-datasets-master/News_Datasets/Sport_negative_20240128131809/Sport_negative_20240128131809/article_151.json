    "text": "The Sacramento Kings finished the 2022-23 NBA season with the 24th ranked defense, using defensive rating as our measuring stick. It was a bad defense, bolstered by an all-time great offensive season. Entering this season, the hope was that the Kings would improve, even if it was just a little, on the defensive end. At a quick glance, you’d see that the Kings are currently the 21st ranked defense in the NBA. Huzzah! Improvement! Raise the banners and light the beam! Unfortunately, if we look past the initial ranking and look at any of the defensive metrics, we find that the Kings are not currently any better than last season. In fact, they’re remarkably similar in nearly every way. If you’d like to follow along at home, I’m using numbers for [2022-23](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/defense?TeamID=1610612758&Season=2022-23) and [2023-24](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/defense?TeamID=1610612758) from NBA.com/stats. First, the aforementioned defensive rating. Although the Kings rank a couple slots higher than last season, their defensive rating is currently slightly worse. Last season they finished at 116.0, and currently have a defensive rating of 116.4. Where it gets really fascinating are the other team-metrics available: Defensive rebounds per game: Last year 32.9, this year 32.6 Defensive rebound %: Last year 73.1%, this year 73.3% Steals: Last year 7.0, this year 7.1 Blocks: Last year 3.4, this year 4.1 Opponent points off turnovers: Last year 16.3, this year 16.5 Opponent second chance points: Last year 12.7, this year 11.7 Opponent fast break points: Last year 11.5, this year 11.6 Opponent points in the paint: Last year 53.5, this year 53.3 Opponent shooting numbers are also nearly identical between last year and this year. So what do we make of all this? Despite the individual improvement we’ve seen from some players, like De’Aaron Fox and Keegan Murray, and minor improvements in blocks per game and second chance points, the Kings remain a flawed team that struggles on defense. But it makes sense. After all, the Kings opted for continuity this offseason, bringing back the same core pieces as last year’s squad. The Kings banked on internal improvement and continuity. And really, despite the lack of improvement defensively, the Kings are a better team than they were at this point last year. They just aren’t significantly better. There’s obviously still a lot of season left to play, and perhaps the Kings can continue to improve as the season goes along. Perhaps the Kings can land an impact defender via trade, allowing easier matchups for the rest of the roster. One final thought on the Kings defensive numbers, courtesy of our own Omer Khan. Offenses are more effective and efficient overall compared to last season, so maintaining the same rating and numbers is actually a sign of improvement. Last year the Kings set the record for best offensive rating in NBA history. So far this season there are 6(!) teams with a better offensive rating than last year’s Kings team. In an ever-improving offensive league, the rankings may indicate improvement and context better than the raw numbers themselves. We’re roughly a third of the way through this season, we’ll have to wait and see if the Kings can make a more significant defensive improvement the rest of the year.",

The NEC attacker says that he sometimes had a big mouth and cites discussions with Mitchell van der Gaag as an example.\nArticle continues after advertisement\n“I can just be honest: as a little boy I was always quiet, but difficult,” says Hansen\nKick ‘t Met. The youth international played for Ajax for ten years and joined NEC on a free transfer last summer. “If I disagreed with something, you were told. It doesn’t matter who.”\n“Now I’m older and I think: I wish I had kept my mouth shut,” Hansen continues. “It always went the same with Mitchell van der Gaag (formerly trainer of Jong Ajax, now assistant to Erik ten Hag at Man United, ed.): he said something, i said something. He said something again, I said something again. So it went on. I didn’t think: he keeps going, I have to stop.”\nArticle continues after advertisement\nHansen has now changed his behavior, as tablemate Million Manhoef also sees. The NEC right winger has scored two goals and one assist so far this season in the Eredivisie.\nread more\nArrival of Ocampos was a drop for Ajax pupil: ‘Nobody understood why he was brought in’\n2023-12-28 22:35:44\n#Discussions #Van #der #Gaag #Ajax",

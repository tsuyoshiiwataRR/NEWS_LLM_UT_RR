    "text": "Watch Now: Charlotte announced Thursday that Hayward will have his left calf strain re-evaluated in two weeks.\nWith this news, Hayward will miss at least the next seven games for Charlotte. That means the earliest possible return date will be Jan. 12 against the Spurs. With the veteran forward out of the lineup for a couple of weeks, the Hornets will need guys like Cody Martin and Bryce McGowens to step up.\nMore News Hornets' Gordon Hayward: Inactive for Thursday 1D ago • by RotoWire Staff Hornets' Gordon Hayward: Exits early Tuesday 2D ago • by RotoWire Staff Hornets' Gordon Hayward: Officially cleared 8D ago • by RotoWire Staff Hornets' Gordon Hayward: On track for Wednesday 9D ago • by RotoWire Staff Hornets' Gordon Hayward: Won't play Monday 10D ago • by RotoWire Staff Hornets' Gordon Hayward: Questionable for Monday 11D ago • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Basketball Stories December rookie report: Chet, Victor, more Alex Barutha • 6 min read Christmas Day slate games, more Steve Alexander • 7 min read Waiver Wire: Week 10 Alex Rikleen • 6 min read Week 9 pulse check: Who's hot, who's not Alex Barutha • 7 min read Week 9 starts/sits: Top NBA fantasy plays Adam King • 4 min read Waiver Wire: Week 9 Alex Rikleen • 7 min read",

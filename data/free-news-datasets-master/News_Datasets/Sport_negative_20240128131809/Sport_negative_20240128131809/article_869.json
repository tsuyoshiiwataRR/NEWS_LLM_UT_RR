    "text": "Hornets forward [Gordon Hayward](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/haywago01.html?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.hoopsrumors.com&utm_campaign=2023-12-28_bbr) will be reevaluated in two weeks after suffering a left calf strain on Tuesday against the Clippers, according to a team release ( [Twitter link](https://x.com/HornetsPR/status/1740550191265276017?s=20)). Hayward played just 23 minutes on Tuesday in the game he suffered the injury. He left that contest in the third quarter and did not return. Hayward has appeared in 25 games, all starts, for the Hornets this year, averaging 14.5 points and shooting 36.1% from beyond the arc. He’s in the final season of a four-year, $120MM contract he signed with Charlotte in 2020 and will earn $31.5MM in 2023/24. Rookie [Brandon Miller](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/millebr02.html?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.hoopsrumors.com&utm_campaign=2023-12-28_bbr) is also dealing with an ankle issue, but he’s expected to play on Thursday ( [Twitter link](https://x.com/HornetsPR/status/1740552262756471161?s=20) via Hornets) — he and [Cody Martin](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/martico01.html?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.hoopsrumors.com&utm_campaign=2023-12-28_bbr) are among those who could take over some of the minutes left by Hayward.

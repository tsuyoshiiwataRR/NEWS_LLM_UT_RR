    "text": "Tottenham's run of three successive wins came to an abrupt end at the Amex Stadium on Thursday evening as Brighton & Hove Albion ran out 4-2 winners. Second best right from the first whistle, [Spurs fell behind on 11 minutes as Jack Hinshelwood rifled the ball high into the net after finding himself in acres of space](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/fixtures-results/brighton-vs-tottenham-live-kick-28356512). It was to then get even worse for Spurs as Dejan Kulusevski gave away a penalty for a pull on Danny Welbeck, thus allowing Joao Pedro the opportunity to net from 12 yards as he sent Guglielmo Vicario the wrong way. [Tottenham](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/) did threaten in first-half stoppage-time but Richarlison's deflected effort struck the outside of the box as Postecoglou's men looked to reduce the deficit, with the Brazilian then having two goals chalked off for offside after the break. Falling 4-0 behind following Pervis Estupinan's stunning strike from distance and another Joao Pedro penalty, Spurs set up a tense finale following Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies goals but they unfortunately couldn't find the net once again despite fashioning a number of openings. Here are five things football.london spotted in the game on the south coast. Dier situation It just goes from bad to worse for Postecoglou on the Tottenham injury front. Already losing some key players over the course of the season and set to lose another three early next month due to the upcoming international tournaments, the Spurs boss now has to make do with [Cristian Romero](https://www.football.london/all-about/cristian-romero) for a period of time. The Argentina international sustained a hamstring strain in the first half of the win over Everton [and he will now be absent for potentially five weeks](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/news/breaking-ange-postecoglou-delivers-cristian-28353081). As a result of his injury, Emerson Royal remained in the Spurs team but shifted over from left-back to partner Ben Davies at centre-back. [Eric Dier](https://www.football.london/all-about/eric-dier) was the man to replace Romero at the start of the second half against Everton last Saturday but he had to settle for a spot on the bench with Emerson getting the nod in the middle. Finding himself behind the Brazilian at centre-back for the recent games against Aston Villa and Man City, Postecoglou's selection very much highlighted Dier's place in his thinking. Time will tell if he is to get a reprieve for the Bournemouth game on Sunday going on the fact Tottenham shipped four at the Amex.

Outstanding for Tottenham ever since his summer switch from Empoli, the Italian produced a fine double save in the opening couple of minutes to stop Brighton from netting. Firstly on hand to save from Welbeck after the ex-Manchester United man had put himself into a goalscoring position after some lovely play in the box, the Italian then thwarted the same player moments later. This save was even better than his first after denying the frontman from point-blank range with a reflex stop after the ball had fallen kindly to the Seagulls star. Vicario has enjoyed an incredible start to life in a Tottenham shirt and [he is very much the answer the long-term successor to Lloris](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/transfer-news/tottenham-sanction-january-transfer-mls-28360351). Another ban incoming Tottenham really are picking up suspensions like they are going out of fashion this season. Already losing Yves Bissouma to three separate bans, Destiny Udogie to two and Romero to one, they now have another player joining the ever-growing list. The player in question is [Kulusevski](https://www.football.london/all-about/dejan-kulusevski) after he picked up his fifth yellow card of the season at the Amex. The Swede could have no complaints at all after tugging back Welbeck in the penalty box just as he looked to try and make contact with the ball. Not initially given by referee Jarred Gillett, the official halted play moments later and went to his screen to review the evidence before pointing to the spot. Kulusevski will now miss Sunday's final match of 2023 at home to Bournemouth as a result of his booking. With the cut-off point for a one-match ban for five yellow cards the 19th Premier League game of the campaign, all Kulusevski had to do to avoid the suspension was get through the Brighton match unscathed. Unfortunately he couldn't do that and now Postecoglou will have to shuffle his pack once again. Those offsides Trailing 2-0 at the break but very much still in the contest providing that they made things happen in the final third, Spurs needed a quick start to the second half to give themselves a fighting chance. Thirty-two seconds after the restart [Richarlison](https://www.football.london/all-about/richarlison) had the ball in the back of the net with a smart finish across Jason Steele but he was flagged for offside. The same was to happen again midway inside the second half as Kulusevski and Richarlison linked up and the Spurs striker slotted the ball beyond the Brighton shot-stopper. He was once again offside by a yard. The offside was extremely frustrating from a Tottenham perspective, as not long after, it was 3-0 as Estupinan found the net with a 25-yard stunner that left Vicario with no chance at all. [Had Richarlison not strayed a yard offside for his second disallowed goal](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/news/son-heung-min-reveals-tottenham-28355744) then we could be talking about a different scoreline altogether. Veliz moment On a dismal night on the south coast for Tottenham, there was at least one positive to take from the fixture. Usually coming on in the dying minutes of matches so far this season, [Alejo Veliz](https://www.football.london/all-about/alejo-veliz) was given his most amount of playing time in one game at the Amex as he replaced Brennan Johnson with 20 minutes to go. [Keen to make a big impact in north London following his switch from his homeland in the summer](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/players/alejo-veliz-10-tottenham-players-28349290), Veliz managed to register his first senior goal for the Lilywhites in the 81st minute as he converted from close range after Son Heung-min had squared the ball to him. Although his goal was scant consolation, you could see how much it meant to him as he punched the air in delight and clenched his fists a number of times. Despite the scoreline, his celebration was perfectly understandable as it was simply a release for scoring his maiden Tottenham goal. Veliz wasn't far off from doubling his tally in stoppage time after producing a sharp turn to get the better of the experienced Lewis Dunk but his effort on goal was unfortunately blocked by the Brighton captain. It was a good showing from the Argentine and more minutes could now be set to come his way.

    "text": "The [Boston Celtics](/nba/boston-celtics) have [surged](https://clutchpoints.com/celtics-news-how-monster-kristaps-porzingis-creates-so-many-problems-helpless-opponents) to the best record in the NBA at 23-6 this season. They've looked like the top contender for the NBA championship, but on Thursday they showed that the NBA season is a grind and anything can happen on any given night. The Celtics came into Thursday set to square off against the league-worst [Detroit Pistons](/nba/detroit-pistons) who recently set a [not-so good](https://clutchpoints.com/pistons-news-cade-cunningham-respect-posts-flood-the-internet-amid-detroits-new-low) record. But that didn't matter so much as the Celtics went into halftime trailing by 19 points and heard [a chorus of boos](https://twitter.com/ClutchPoints/status/1740546346606821800) from the home crowd. ‚Äù Celtics fans are booing their team as Cade Cunningham and the Pistons go up 19 points üò¨ [pic.twitter.com/t3chUmhi3h] ‚Äî ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) [December 29, 2023] The Celtics were coming off a very successful four game West Coast road swing where they went 3-1 with wins against the Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings. As well as they've played this season, it's understandable why Celtics fans would be disgusted with their performance in the first half against the Pistons. With the Pistons loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday, they officially set the record for the NBA's longest losing streak at 27 games. Even though the Celtics came into the game short-handed with Jaylen Brown out due to a back injury, this is still a game that the Celtics have no excuse for looking this poorly. It's true that the Pistons have actually been fighting and clawing during their losing streak, they just end up running out of gas and overmatched. It might be understandable if this game was close but the Celtics are literally getting blown out at home. Cade Cunningham had 22 points in the first half to lead the Pistons. Jayson Tatum had 16 to lead the Celtics.",

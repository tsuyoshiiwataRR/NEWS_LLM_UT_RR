    "text": "Browns wide receiver Elijah Moore left Thursday's 37-20 win over the New York Jets with a concussion, coach Kevin Stefanski said in his postgame news conference. In the second quarter, Moore was tackled by Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley after a catch and appeared to hit his head on the ground.To that point, Moore had five receptions for 61 yards and a touchdown.\"It's a shame that Elijah kind of got tackled on his head there, but I'm really happy for him the way he stepped up tonight and had a big game for us,\" Browns quarterback Joe Flacco said.Just before halftime, Moore walked off the field with Browns medical personnel and an independent neurologist. He was ruled out for the remainder of the game at the start of the third quarter.\nMoore was one of the Browns' big acquisitions in the offseason. They picked up the receiver in a March trade with the Jets , with whom he had grown disgruntled.\nMoore made his presence known on the Browns' fifth possession. In fact, it both started and ended with the third-year pro out of Ole Miss, including an 8-yard touchdown catch from Flacco with 6:15 left in the second quarter to make it 27-7 Browns.Moore had three consecutive catches netting 31 yards to open the drive. That included a 24-yard gain on third and 1 from the Cleveland 28 in which the pass looked to be intercepted by New York's Michael Carter II, only Moore ripped the ball out of his hands and came down with it himself.",

    "text": "CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (WICS) â€” Terrence Shannon Jr. has been suspended from the Illinois men's basketball team. On Wednesday, the Douglas (Kansas) Count District Attorney issued a warrant for the arrest of Shannon Jr. Officials say Shannon Jr. is facing charges of rape, as defined under applicable Kansas law. We're told the alleged incident occurred while Shannon visited Lawrence, Kansas, to attend the Illinois at Kansas football game, played on Sept. 8. Officials say Shannon was not in Lawrence on official University business, nor was he a member of the University party. Shannon traveled to Lawrence on Thursday, where he presented himself to authorities. Shannon posted bail and is returning to Champaign. In a statement, University of Illinois Athletic Director, Josh Whitman said: The University and DIA have shown time and again that we have zero tolerance for sexual misconduct,\" said Whitman. \"At the same time, DIA policy affords student-athletes appropriate levels of due process based on the nature and severity of the allegations. We will rely on that policy and our prior experiences to mange this situation appropriately for the university and involved party. We're told DIA and Urbana campus officials have been aware of a Lawrence police investigation into Shannon since late September but, until Wednesday, had yet to receive actionable information. In a statement from Mark P. Sutter Attorney at Law, he says, \"Since September, when these allegations surfaced, Terrence has cooperated with law enforcement throughout the investigation, declaring his innocence from the beginning. Now, several months later, my office learned that formal charges were filed against him yesterday in Lawrence, KS. In less than 24 hours, my client responded, and he voluntarily surrendered to local authorities for processing and release. Terrence is innocent of these charges, and he intends to take his case to trial.\" The full charging documents are listed below. This is an ongoing story we will bring you more information as it becomes available.",

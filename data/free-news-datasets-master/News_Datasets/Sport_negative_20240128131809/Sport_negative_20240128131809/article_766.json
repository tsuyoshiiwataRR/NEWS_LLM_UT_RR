    "text": "The Miami Hurricanes had a pretty subpar season, finishing 7-5 on the year which earned them a matchup against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in the Pinstripe Bowl. And their year ended on a sour note, falling in the game which earned them the program as a whole and head coach Mario Cristobal a ton of criticism on social media. Rutgers dominated the line of scrimmage in this game, recording 208 rushing yards in the game to come away with a 31-24 victory. This now marks two straight seasons for Miami under Cristobal where the team has not performed up to expectations. And it sure seems like the college football world is tired of seeing this from a once-great program like Miami. Former Ohio State quarterback Cardale Jones made his feelings known on social media Thursday when it came to one ACC program. “Man, I feel bad for the recruits going to Miami U for NIL……. Bad staff, no stability within program and one of the worst college home game atmospheres. Chasing the money isn’t always the answer. But good luck.” Jim Leavitt, a former defensive coordinator under Cristobal during his time at Oregon, also criticized Cristobal and his team after this most recent loss. “Unreal. Miami 4-2. Lots of time. Own 40. Up the gut. Gets stuffed. GT game. Take a knee. Decisions by a HC are so big. Miami ends up 7-6.” A number of fans also chimed in, echoing Jones and Leavitt in their criticism of Miami. In two years with Cristobal at the helm, Miami has recorded just a 12-12 record, a 12-13 record if you add in this most recent bowl game loss to Rutgers. Miami was obviously once a dominant program in college football that got some of the top players in the country. They still happen to bring in some of the top players in recruiting. But the results on the field certainly leave a lot to be desired.

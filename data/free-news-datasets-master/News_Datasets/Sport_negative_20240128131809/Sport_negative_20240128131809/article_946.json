    "text": "Cleveland Browns wide receiver Elijah Moore leaves game with head injury, ruled out Browns wide receiver Elijah Moore [left Thursday's game against the New York Jets](/story/sports/pro/browns/2023/12/28/browns-vs-jets-instant-analysis-live-game-score-updates-thursday-night-football-nfl-week-17-playoffs/72037806007/) with a head injury. In the second quarter, Moore was tackled by Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley after a catch and appeared to hit his head on the ground. To that point, Moore had five receptions for 61 yards and a touchdown. Just before halftime, Moore walked off the field with Browns trainers and an NFL independent neurologist. He was ruled out for the remainder of the game at the start of the third quarter. Moore was one of the Browns' big acquisitions in the offseason. They picked up the receiver [in a March trade with the Jets](/story/sports/pro/browns/2023/03/22/elijah-moore-acquired-trade-new-york-jets-cleveland-browns-receiver-nfl-transactions-draft-picks/70038917007/), with whom he had grown disgruntled. Moore made his presence known on the Browns' fifth possession. In fact, it both started and ended with the third-year pro out of Ole Miss, including an 8-yard touchdown catch from quarterback Joe Flacco with 6:15 left in the second quarter to make it 27-7 Browns. Moore had three consecutive catches netting 31 yards to open the drive. That included a 24-yard gain on third and 1 from the Cleveland 28 in which the pass looked to be intercepted by New York's Michael Carter II, only Moore ripped the ball out of his hands and came down with it himself.",

    "text": "Ange Postecoglou aimed another dig at VAR after Brighton captain Lewis Dunk escaped a red card during Tottenham’s 4-2 loss to the Seagulls. Spurs were blown away at the Amex on Thursday night, with stunning strikes from Jack Hinshelwood and Pervis Estupinan and two Joao Pedro penalties putting Brighton 4-0 up.\nThe North Londoners rallied late on with goals from Alejo Veliz – his first for the club – and Ben Davies giving them hope, but it was too late for a miraculous comeback.\nThere was a moment of controversy in the build-up to Veliz’s goal however, with\n Dunk making a reckless challenge on Dejan Kulusevski.\nMoreover, it wasn’t even the first time in the game that Dunk had made a studs up challenge on the Swede.\nThe England defender was booked for the second foul and will now miss Brighton’s next game against\nWest Ham.\nPostecoglou seemed to think it was a sending off offence and blasted the Video Assistant Referee for not getting involved, while also sarcastically praising them for the way they awarded the first penalty.\n‘It’s amazing that VAR picks up everything apart from a tackle that maybe puts out another of our players,’ the manager said post-match.\n‘There are no grumbles from me with the penalties. They were clear and obvious. The first penalty was so clear and obvious it only took them three minutes to make the decision.’\nPostecoglou added that he believed Kulusevski was ‘okay’ after the fouls.\nThe result has left Tottenham fifth in the table, six points off leaders Liverpool, and they will be hoping to bounce back when they host Bournemouth on New Year’s Eve.\n‘Look, fair to say we were looking a bit tired and lacked our usual sharpness, especially at the start of the game,’ the Spurs boss reflected.\n‘We’ve been starting games well. I guess that’s understandable, we’ve been on this run for a whole now and asking players to perform at levels.\n‘It’s very demanding the way we play physically and today we kind of looked like a team that wasn’t at its sharpest. Brighton are a good side and they took advantage of that.\n‘Ultimately what I do know is the players everything they had they gave and that’s all I can ask for.’\nMORE :\nAndre Onana wants to delay AFCON call-up so he can play Manchester United’s FA Cup tie\nMORE :\nHugo Lloris in talks with MLS side as he finally nears Tottenham exit\nFor more stories like this,\ncheck our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on",

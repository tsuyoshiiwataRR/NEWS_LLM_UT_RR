    "text": "PETALING JAYA: Expect a major revamp in the Johor Darul Ta’zim (JDT) squad next year.\nThis is following a shocking move by JDT to let go their coach Esteban Solari and several players under their payroll due to their financial restructuring exercise.\nAnd with the changes, JDT owner Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim has even declared that the Southern Tigers will be the underdog next season.\nJDT had been untouchable over the last two seasons, having won all the domestic titles – Malaysian Open, Super League, FA Cup and Charity Shield.\nThis season, the team under Solari won the Super League title without even dropping a match, and scoring more than 100 goals.\nBesides the reputable Solari, the club also announced that they would not keep their stalwarts like centreback Aidil Zafuan Abdul Radzak, wingback S. Kunanlan, midfielder Leandro Velasquez, striker Ahmad Hazwan Bakri and centreback Adam Nor Azlin.\nJDT also stated that wingback Oscar Arribas, striker Syafiq Ahmad, wingers Safawi Rasid and Akhyar Rashid and goalkeeper Haziq Nadzli will be leaving the club on loan.\nSafawi and Akhyar could be moving to Terengganu on loan, while Syafiq is being linked to Kedah.\nHaziq could be moving to Perak together with Adam.\nWith that latest development, the Johor crown prince decided to underplay their prospect next season.\n“We will be underdog next year. There will be more leaving the club. It’s a process to save money,” said Tunku Ismail.\n“The stadium is rarely full. The open ticket is only RM10. Whatever it is, please pray for the best for the club. Thanks to those who continuously supported us,” he posted on the club’s Instagram account.\nSo far, the only confirmed arrival is Argentinian-Syrian midfielder Jalil Elias. It is learnt that the club could also wrap up deals for newly naturalised attacking midfielder Romel Morales and rightback Azam Azmi Murad.\nTwo days ago, the club’s chief executive officer Alistair Edwards revealed that a restructuring exercise would be done to ensure sustainability.\nPlus, with a longer 2024-2025 M-League season, which would take 12 months to complete, it is understandable why the club had made such drastic move.\n“Having spent a considerable amount of money on our football project including football infrastructure over the past six to seven years, JDT need to structure our finances to ensure sustainability,” said Edwards.\n“The club have decided to reduce spending by 30-40% to enable this process. We will not be spending money. We will be reducing in terms of our expenditure.\n“The Southern Tigers will be undergoing a squad transformation that will see several changes in personnel ahead of the 2024 and 2025 seasons.”\nOpen Modal ×",

    "text": "THIS was supposed to be the Christmas that saw Arsenal put the squeeze on Manchester City, a time to put clear air between themselves and Pep Guardiola’s team while the Premier League champions were away in the Middle East. [Try for £1](https://www.mailsubscriptions.co.uk/products/197224/1-for-3-months-then-12.99-a-month) [Sign in] JACK GREALISH’S mansion was raided for £1million worth of jewellery by thieves on Wednesday night while the winger was playing for Manchester City. ARSENAL were left furious after West Ham’s controversial opener. Here’s what the pundits said: Moyes does a job on the Gunners to hit their title bid TOTTENHAM icon Hugo Lloris is set to join Los Angeles FC, bringing the curtain down on his 11-year stay in north London. WHAT a moment for 18-year-old Jack Hinshelwood, who opened the scoring in fine style for Brighton. SON HEUNG-MIN slammed Tottenham’s performance in their 4-2 defeat at Brighton and demanded they use it as a ‘wake-up call’ to keep their season on track.

Lewis Steele JUST like that, we’re into the second half of the Championship season. The table is starting to take shape and the arrival of crunch-time has left many clubs looking nervously behind them. So, ahead of a full fixture list tonight, Wonders of the Pyramid tests the temperature in the second tier… Associated Newspapers Limited is a company registered in England and Wales (Company No. 084121), Northcliffe House, 2 Derry Street, Kensington, London, W8 5TT.

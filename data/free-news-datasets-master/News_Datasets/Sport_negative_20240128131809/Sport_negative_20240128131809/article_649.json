    "text": "Competing in the decathlon – at which I won the gold medal at the 1980 and 1984 Olympic Games – I've seen performances by some inspirational women. But the truth is, no matter how hard they trained, they could never have matched my times (other than the 1,500metre run, where some women could beat me). My physique was too different – too male. It would have been grossly unfair for me to compete against them. My victory would have been a travesty. So when I see trans women like American swimmer Lia Thomas or Canadian cyclist Veronica Ivy (formerly known as Rachel McKinnon) on the podium, I know they are biologically male and physical advantage has helped them to win. All my sporting instincts rebel against that. For sport to mean anything, it must be fair. Women's 100m final of the 19th Asian Games at Hangzhou Olympic Sports Centre Stadium on September 30, 2023 Lia Thomas during a swminning meet on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania in 2019 That's why we need clarity – such as that offered by Boris Johnson, who said: 'I don't think biological males should be competing in female sporting events. Maybe that's a controversial thing to say, but it just seems to me to be sensible. 'I also happen to think that women should have spaces – whether it's in hospitals, prison or changing rooms – which are dedicated to women.' I, too, strongly oppose allowing trans women to take part in female sports. I don't consider this controversial, nor political. It's about fairness. Trans athletes say they do everything possible to compete fairly, for instance by taking testosterone blockers. Let us put aside the fact that I have strong reservations about the use of any hormone-altering drugs in sport. But it seems patently obvious that no pill can wipe out the benefits that come from growing up biologically male in terms of muscular and skeletal strength. These trans women have been through male puberty. They have longer limbs, broader shoulders, thicker bones, better power-to-weight ratios and larger heart and blood volumes. Nothing they can do will change that: they are always going to outperform biological women. Canadian cyclist Rachel McKinnon warms up before competing in the 2019 UCI Track Cycling World Masters Championship in Manchester This is a problem I have witnessed grow from a minor concern into a national controversy in sport – and beyond – although, in recent months, it does feel as though something is indeed changing. My belief is that sport should have a women's section and a new, open class where transgender women would be welcomed and could compete fairly. There should be space for trans women in sport – but not at the expense of all women. Like any decent human being, I fully support the right of everyone to present however they want, use the name and pronouns they feel reflect their true selves, and live their lives as they wish. It is sad that equal rights for transgender people have been suppressed for such a long time. Over the past 20 years, we've seen the emergence of a more compassionate society – but unfairness to women is the unintended consequence. And ridding ourselves of old-fashioned gender stereotypes should not result in potentially giving biologically male predators – who identify as female – access to women's prisons or women's domestic violence refuges. Women have fought hard to achieve their safe spaces. They have to be respected. I've been increasingly outspoken about this on social media and people attending my gym in Putney, south-west London, have started to ask me about it. How is any young girl going to feel inspired to take up sport if she knows she'll be competing against – and losing to – biological males? And how can any parent feel their daughter is safe in a changing room where biologically-intact male athletes are dressing and showering alongside? Sir Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, found himself unable to say what a woman even is. It's not difficult – if in doubt, ask any five-year-old. I'm not interested in party politics. It doesn't surprise me, though, that Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens are questioned by voters when they lack the courage to state simple biological facts. Some of my good friends, including the Czech-American tennis star Martina Navratilova and the record-breaking British competitive swimmer Sharron Davies, have done so and been on the receiving end of shocking abuse from trans extremists as a result. I want the whole world to know I stand beside them. I have also been appalled at the violent threats aimed at novelist J.K. Rowling, who has spoken nothing but calm common sense. Does that make me a feminist? Well, no one has ever called me that before, but there's a first time for everything. What I do know is that I'm not transphobic or a misogynist – two slurs that have been chucked at me on Twitter. If we become afraid to tell the truth, we really are in trouble. And if trans women are allowed to compete in female categories, then women's sport isn't just in trouble – it's finished.",

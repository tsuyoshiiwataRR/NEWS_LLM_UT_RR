    "text": "Buffalo Sabres general manager Kevyn Adams cut down his roster Thursday by waiving one of the three players he signed when unrestricted free agency began in July.\nTyson Jost was placed on waivers following practice at LECOM Harborcenter to allow the Sabres to activate Zemgus Girgensons from injured reserve. Jost, whom Adams re-signed to a one-year contract in July, has two goals and four points in 29 games. He skated only 6:53 in the 4-1 loss to Boston on Wednesday, despite starting the game as the center between Alex Tuch and Jeff Skinner.\nThe Sabres also put center Tage Thompson on the NHL’s non-roster list. He is still away from the team, tending to a personal matter. Girgensons will bring a physical, simple approach that the Sabres have needed in their bottom six.\n“Getting Zemgus back, he’s a guy, at his core, he’s a competitive, hardworking guy, and where we’ve been challenged is in that area,” Sabres coach Don Granato said. “We need more high-energy, working guys. It’ll be big to get him back, obviously.”",

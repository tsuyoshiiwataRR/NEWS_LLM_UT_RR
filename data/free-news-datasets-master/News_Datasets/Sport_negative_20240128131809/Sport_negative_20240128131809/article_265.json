    "text": "Arsenal 0-2 West Ham (Soucek 13‚Ä≤, Mavropanos 55‚Ä≤, Benrahma missed pen 90+5‚Ä≤)\nEMIRATES STADIUM ‚Äî Arsenal could yet end 2023 at the top of the Premier League , but a damaging defeat to West Ham will give Mikel Arteta plenty to ponder as he plots a happier end to this season than last.\nAnother contentious goal will provide fuel to the online conspiracy theorists, but the concession of a second from a set-piece and a panicked response to going behind will worry even the most fervent of Arsenal believers. Nobody expected this.\nThanks to events in Newcastle last month we all know the word that would have been circling around Arteta‚Äôs brain after Jarrod Bowen was deemed to have kept the ball alive for Tomas Soucek‚Äôs opening goal: Desgracia.\nThe Spanish term that Arteta used when defending himself against an FA charge after his St James‚Äô Park rant has connotations of misfortune which was apt for this latest VAR-troversy. The world‚Äôs most lucrative league didn‚Äôt have a camera angle that could definitively prove that the ball was out of play before Bowen tapped it across goal, and so it had to stand.\nWell, well, well!\nThe Emirates is stunned as West Ham break the deadlock thanks to Tomas Soucek! #PLonPrime #ARSWHU pic.twitter.com/R2T3jkcB1j\n‚Äî Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) December 28, 2023 Had he done so a few yards over to the right, goal-line technology would have picked it up. Therein lies the limits of technology in its current guise. Thankfully, Amazon had the foresight to hire Mark Clattenburg to offer his expertise. ‚ÄúThe ball looks to be slightly in play,‚Äù was the sheepish analysis from Saudi Arabia‚Äôs first true footballing trailblazer.\nWhether the goal was legitimate or not, it was a mess of Arsenal‚Äôs own making, a belated Christmas present gift-wrapped for their grateful opponents.\nWhat followed was entirely predictable: Arsenal domination versus West Ham submission. Defending a one-goal lead is the oldest trick in David Moyes‚Äô book and one that has irked fans of a team featuring the attacking talents of Bowen, Mohammed Kudus and Lucas Paqueta. Fair to say it worked a treat here.\nThey rode their luck before the break, though. Bukayo Saka forced superhero reflexes from Alphonse Areola before lashing a strike off the base of the post soon after as the Hammers sunk deeper toward the Clock End.\nDisaster struck from one of the visitors‚Äô attempted breakways when Paqueta pulled up less than an hour after receiving treatment during the warm-up, the one negative to an otherwise perfect evening.\nArsenal raced out of the blocks after half-time, racking up the corners and the half chances. Declan Rice, taunted with chants of ‚Äúwhat a waste of money‚Äù by the fans who used to idolise him, bent a vicious strike inches over the bar after the restart.\nThe game‚Äôs second goal came from a player facing their former club. Spoiler alert, it wasn‚Äôt Rice. Konstantinos Mavropanos made seven Premier League appearances for Arsenal across a forgettable 18-month spell before being moved on and wouldn‚Äôt have even played had Kurt Zouma or Nayef Aguerd been available. His hands went up in respectful celebration, but the wide grin betrayed his delight.\nKonstantinos Mavropanos silences the Emirates!\nThe former Arsenal man heads home brilliantly for West Ham's second üëè #PLonPrime #ARSWHU pic.twitter.com/KNXA11gGOV\n‚Äî Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) December 28, 2023 It was a superb header that satisfyingly caressed the underside of the bar on its way in and one that Gabriel Jesus failed to replicate moments later at the other end. Much as the Brazilian offers his lack of ruthlessness places a limit on Arsenal‚Äôs ambition. Ivan Toney‚Äôs reputation is growing each week.\nArteta lobbed one attacking player onto the pitch after another in search of a route back. Leandro Trossard briefly found himself playing as a defensive midfielder. Emile Smith Rowe missed a header, Saka had a penalty appeal waved away, but West Ham saw out the game relatively comfortably to vindicate Moyes‚Äô tactics.\nA horrible night for Rice got even worse in added time when he tripped Emerson Palmieri inside his own box. David Raya at least prevented the scoreline from getting any worse, thwarting Said Benrahma from the spot as West Ham fans chanted Rice‚Äôs name.\nIt was the Scot‚Äôs first win away at Arsenal in his 23rd attempt. An unforeseen masterclass that will delight his former foes on Merseyside.",

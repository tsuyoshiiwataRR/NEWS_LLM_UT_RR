Speaking after the match, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said his side had dominated the match but that they would have to get better of the course of the rest of the season, and looked to the game at Fulham. Mikel Arteta told Arsenal that they \"have to improve\" after a disappointing [2-0 home defeat to West Ham](https://www.eurosport.com/football/premier-league/2023-2024/arsenal-0-2-west-ham-tomas-soucek-in-the-goals-as-mikel-artetas-side-suffer-premier-league-title-set_sto9934726/story.shtml)on Thursday night in the Premier League. There was a lengthy review for the opening goal as West Ham striker Jarrod Bowen’s assist came when the ball looked to be potentially out of play, but VAR could not demonstrate that the ball was out and the goal was awarded. West Ham’s second goal came 10 minutes after the start of the second half through former Arsenal defender Konstaninos Mavropanos, and there was a late penalty chance missed by Said Benrahma. The result means Arsenal missed the chance to retake the lead of the Premier League title race going into the new year, while for West Ham they are now four points outside the top four as they look to build on their UEFA Europa Conference League success last season. [Speaking to the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c1eyllqv19qo)after the match, Arteta said that his team would have to step up their efforts, and he did not dwell on the decision to allow Tomas Soucek’s opener. He said: \"We want to be at the top and today we are very, very disappointed. We had so much dominance in the game. We are in a really good position. Today is a disappointing night. We have to pick ourselves up for a big game against Fulham.\" Asked about the controversial opener, he continued: \"It is what it is. The technology we have at the moment is not clear enough if the ball is out.” With another game soon coming up against Fulham, Arteta said his team needed to improve. \"We dominated for 100 minutes,” he stated. “When we had big situations, we had players inside the box totally free. I think the players put an enormous effort in. It's a difficult dressing room right now but we have another game in 72 hours. This is football, we have to improve in certain areas.\" - - - [TNT Sports](https://www.tntsports.co.uk/)presents the premium live sports rights previously carried by BT Sport including the Premier League, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Conference League, Gallagher Premiership Rugby, Investec Champions Cup, EPCR Challenge Cup, MotoGP, Cricket, UFC, Boxing and WWE.

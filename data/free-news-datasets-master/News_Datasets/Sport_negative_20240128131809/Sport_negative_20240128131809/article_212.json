    "text": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was throwing passes with the injured thumb on his left hand at the team’s Thursday practice, and he appeared to have no limitations.\nTagovailoa let short, intermediate and deep balls fly without wearing anything on the thumb on his throwing hand.\nThe Dolphins quarterback was first learned to be dealing with the thumb injury, along with a quadriceps ailment, after both he and coach Mike McDaniel had their Wednesday media sessions, when the team’s first injury report of the week leading up to Sunday’s showdown with the Baltimore Ravens was released.\nThat left Dolphins offensive coordinator Frank Smith to answer on the quarterback’s injury.\n“This time of year, it’s December, and everybody’s working through stuff,” Smith. “As Tua and all the guys work through it, we just make sure we take it one day at a time, focus on Baltimore.”\nHe deflected questions on his status for Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium, whether he has any limitations on throws from the Ravens game and noted contingencies are always prepared for when asked if backup quarterback Mike White needed to get extra reps. Smith did say he believes Tagovailoa hurt the thumb on a throw against the Dallas Cowboys in last Sunday’s win.\n Tagovailoa appeared fine during the brief media viewing portion of practice, however. As for the quadriceps injury, he was wearing compression on both legs Thursday.\nSmith, though, lightened the mood when he said he himself is questionable for the Ravens game with a papercut.\nWide receiver Tyreek Hill (ankle) and left tackle Terron Armstead (ankle/knee/back) were back at the Dolphins’ Thursday practice, but wide receiver Jaylen Waddle (ankle) and running back Raheem Mostert (ankle/knee) were not seen participating.\n“We have contingencies we work through to put ourselves in the best position possible,” Smith said of possibly being without Waddle.\n...continued swipe to next page « 1 2 » View full story\n©2023 South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

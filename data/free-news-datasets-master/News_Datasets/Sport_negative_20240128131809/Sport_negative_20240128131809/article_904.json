    "text": "Heat's Josh Richardson (back) out Thursday The Miami Heat have ruled out Josh Richardson (back) for Thursday's game against the Golden State Warriors. Richardson carried a doubtful tag into tonight's game due to a back injury, so it's not too surprising that he'll sit the game out. He's averaging 27.8 minutes per game for Miami this season. Richardson has averaged 10 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 3 assists per game for the Heat so far this year.

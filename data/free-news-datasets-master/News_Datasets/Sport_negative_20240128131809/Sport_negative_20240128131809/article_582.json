    "text": "Four days after one of the best games of his career, wide receiver Amari Cooper will sit out when the Cleveland Browns face the visiting New York Jets on Thursday.\nCooper had been bothered by a heel injury and did not practice during the short week. He was officially considered questionable entering the day, but he was on the list when the Browns declared their inactives 90 minutes before kickoff.\nCooper caught 11 passes for a career-high and franchise-record 265 yards to go with two touchdowns in Sunday's 36-22 win over the Houston Texans. He had a 53-yard reception on the first play of the game and later scored on a 75-yard catch.\nThe Browns will be missing a four-time Pro Bowler who has recorded a career-best 1,250 receiving yards in his ninth season in the league and his second in Cleveland. Thursday will be Cooper's first time missing a game in two years with the Browns.\nThe Browns also made kicker Dustin Hopkins (left hamstring) and punter Corey Bojorquez (left quad) inactive. They are set to roll with Riley Patterson at kicker and Matt Haack at punter after elevating both specialists from the practice squad to the active roster.\nThe Jets made veteran wide receiver Allen Lazard inactive due to an illness. Jets kicker Greg Zuerlein, who was being monitored for right quad tightness, is active.\n--Field Level Media",

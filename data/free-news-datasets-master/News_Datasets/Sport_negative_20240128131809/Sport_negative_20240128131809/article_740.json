    "text": "Ja’Marr Chase is doing everything he can to rile up the Chiefs’ defense — and the Bengals wide receiver may not even be on the field come New Year’s Eve. Chase had plenty to say about Kansas City’s defense on Thursday, none of which was particularly nice. Specifically, he took shots at the Chiefs’ secondary, saying that there was “nothing” that stood out about them. “They could take it how they [want to take it]. I don’t care,” Chase told reporters, according to NFL.com . But it didn’t stop there. When Chase, 23, was asked about Chiefs safety and Cincinnati native Bryan Cook, the Bengals wide receiver was far from complimentary. “I don’t even know who that is,” Chase said. “Is that No. 6? I don’t know, man. Just a guy to me. He ain’t Jessie Bates to me. You want me to go [into] comparisons? It’s not the same. Just saying.” And even when the two-time Pro Bowler seemed to finally pay someone on the Chiefs’ defense a compliment, it would still best described as backhanded. He called cornerback L’Jarius Sneed “the best player” on Kansas City, but not without adding that their other defensive backs aren’t on the same level as Sneed. “That’s why they double everybody, because they can’t do it one on one,” Chase said. Though Chase didn’t seem to have an issue speaking frankly about the Bengals’ upcoming opponent, he may not be on the field to answer for his words. Chase was sidelined for last week’s loss to the Steelers due to a separated shoulder, and he was only a limited participant during Thursday’s practice. The Bengals are still in the playoff hunt, and Chase wants to play, but it isn’t a guarantee he will suit up. Cincinnati will be up against a desperate Chiefs team that has dropped five of its last seven games and is frustrated with the turn of events . Chase’s words aren’t likely to sit well with the Chiefs or their fans, but he showed little concern for that. “I’m just adding fire to the fuel right now,” Chase said. “They’re gonna take this and run with it. Hope they put it in their locker. It’s alright, though. As long as I’m mentally ready to play.” The Bengals have defeated the Chiefs in three of their last four meetings.",

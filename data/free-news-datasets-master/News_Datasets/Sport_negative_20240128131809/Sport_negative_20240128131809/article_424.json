    "text": "The lingering effects of the Michigan’s alleged sign stealing hasn’t seemed to dissipate, and it’s apparently changed the way that Alabama has been preparing for their New Year’s Day meeting with the Wolverines in the Rose Bowl. A number of Alabama players confirmed to reporters in California that the team has implemented new security precautions in how it has been handling its film study. Players have not been able to bring their iPads home with them to watch practice film, and they’ve only watched game clips as a team, per USA Today’s Dan Wolken . The added security measures come after Michigan became embroiled scandal that gripped college football. Former Michigan football staffer Connor Stalions was accused of devising an intricate sign-stealing and in-person advanced scouting scheme. Stalions resigned in the wake of the scandal and Harbaugh was suspended the final three Big Ten games of the season. Despite all of the allegations and staff changes, Stallions and Michigan were never accused of computer hacking to gather information. “We were able to watch film as a team, but like personally we can’t watch film because I don’t know, some reason Michigan stealing signs,” Alabama receiver Isaiah Bond told reporters, according to the Tuscaloosa News. “Our coaches told us that probably like a week ago, right before we left to come here.” Alabama offensive coordinator Tommy Rees wouldn’t elaborate as to why the football program has changed things up ahead of the Michigan matchup, USA Today reported . “I’m not gonna get into the whole film, sign-stealing. I’m not talking about it,” Rees said, per the outlet. “Our job is to give our players the best chance to have success on the field. We’re focused on what we’re trying to do and that’s really it.” While the Alabama players acknowledged that it was a notable departure from how the team usually does things, it hasn’t had any negative impact on their prep for the Rose Bowl. Despite the drama surrounding the Wolverines, Michigan went undefeated and captured a Big Ten title in the process. The winner of this semifinal will meet the victor of the Washington-Texas game for a shot at the national title.",

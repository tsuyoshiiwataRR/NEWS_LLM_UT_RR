    "text": "Amid a historic losing streak, the Detroit Pistons are dying for a win to avoid further humiliation this season. Unfortunately, with a game against the top seed in the East, the losing streak is unlikely to end tonight and it should be an easy win for the Celtics . Despite the Pistons' record, however, Cs coach Joe Mazzulla was careful not to underestimate their competition. \"I think there's the expectation that it's supposed to go a certain way or it's supposed to be easy and that's just not the case,\" argued Mazz . \"Just playing the game regardless of the other team's record and I think sometimes you get caught up in this team should be up by this much at first quarter, half-time, and that's just not how it works. It’s an NBA game, they’re NBA players, they’re healthy, they’re playing really hard, and they’ve been in a lot of games. So we have to have the same mindset we've been playing with the stretch of good basketball we've been playing.\" The Celtics are 23-6 entering tonight's game against Detroit and are on track to finish with the best record in the league. Against a team this bad, the Cs should have no problem coming out with the win but stranger things have happened in the NBA and they aren't about to get caught sleeping. Looking at the Pistons, this season has been an utter disaster. Despite the kind words from Joe Mazzulla, they've been the laughingstock of the league so far, and their 27-game losing streak has become a national story. But with a win out of the question for tonight, when might this historic streak finally end? After Boston on Thursday, the Pistons will face the Raptors, Rockets, Jazz, and Warriors. Their most winnable game, however, isn't until January 10th against the San Antonio Spurs . At home against the worst team in the West, Detroit might actually have a chance to earn a victory but then again, they've already lost to the Wizards, Trail Balzers, and injury-riddled Utah Jazz this season. The biggest question in Detroit right now is who is to blame for their ongoing struggles. The players themselves are responsible for the slide and their youth and inexperience have led to an abundance of mistakes on the court. But it's the Pistons front office who may be the most guilty for this run. They've done very little to improve the roster over the years and have whiffed on countless draft picks despite landing in the lottery year after year. Some fans have even blamed head coach Monty Williams for the performance, citing questionable rotations as a sign that he's not cut out for the job. Regardless of who is to blame here, there has to be some level of accountability on the Pistons and they may never get out of this funk until some changes are made. Tonight, they have the chance to stop the bleeding right here and now but this team just doesn't have enough to compete with the best of the best.

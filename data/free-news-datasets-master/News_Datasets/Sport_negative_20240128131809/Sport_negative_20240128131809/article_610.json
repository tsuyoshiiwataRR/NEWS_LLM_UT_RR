    "text": "Son Heung-min slammed Tottenham ’s performance in their 4-2 defeat at Brighton and demanded they use it as a ‘wake-up call’ to keep their season on track. Despite coming into last night’s game on the back of three Premier League wins, an injury-ravaged Spurs side went 4-0 down before Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies pulled two goals back. ‘This is not how we’ve approached the season,’ said Son. ‘This performance was nowhere near the level we want to play. We know our mistakes but now is not the time to point fingers at each other because the games are coming fast. ‘If we’re not playing like the last 15 minutes in every game we will struggle, and this has to be a big wake-up call. The first half was not our game and not us. We have to take a big, big lesson.’ Son admitted it was a 'very disappointing' performance from Spurs against Brighton Tottenham suffered a miserable night on a night where their makeshift defence was exposed Jack Hinshelwood scored the opening goal for Brighton with a fierce drive beating Vicario Your browser does not support iframes.

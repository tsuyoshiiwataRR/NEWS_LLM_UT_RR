    "text": "Former India head coach Ravi Shastri tore into bowling all-rounder Shardul Thakur as India collapsed to a horrendous defeat in the 1st IND vs SA Test. The Proteas clinched a comprehensive win by an innings and 32 runs to prevent India from winning a Test series on South African soil.\nIND vs SA: Shastri says India missed Shami big time\nSpeaking after the loss, Shastri noted that India lacked experience in their bowling attack. Barring experienced pacers Siraj and Bumrah, Shastri feels that India missed Shami big time. As for Shardul Thakur, the former head coach believes that he isn’t a ‘baby’ and that he is only the 4th seamer while the Men in Blue need a strong 3rd pacer.\n“India lacked experience in their bowling attack. They’ve got two of them who are reasonable experienced – Bumrah and Siraj – but they missed Shami big time. Shardul Thakur is not a baby, but he is the 4th seamer. You need a proper third seamer and that makes a massive difference overseas,” Shastri said.\n‘Go play Ranji, first class cricket’\nFurther, Shastri adviced young pacer Arshdeep Singh to play first-class games and Ranji Trophy matches. The ex-coach added that it would allow the pacer to find out if he can bowl long spells and would keep him in the mix of things.\n“The thing is you want to see his First-Class record. Can he bowl long spells? Has he played a lot of Ranji Trophy cricket? I would in fact go and make him play a lot of it, Ranji and First-Class cricket and keep him in the mix because if someone can swing it like he did with the white ball in South Africa, he could be a handy customer,” Shastri added.\nAlso Read:\nFinal Frontier remains unconquered Ajinkya Rahane & Cheteshwar Pujara could have been game-changers in South Africa SKY out, Hardik out, Rohit not interested, Who will lead India in Afghanistan T20Is?

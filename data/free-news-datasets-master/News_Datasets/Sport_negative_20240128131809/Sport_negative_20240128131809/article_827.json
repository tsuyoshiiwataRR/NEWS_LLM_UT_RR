    "text": "World number eight Karolina Muchova said Thursday she would skip next year’s Australian Open because of a persistent wrist injury which already ruled her out of this year’s WTA Finals.\n“This isn’t my favourite thing to share especially at the start of a new season, but unfortunately the pain in a wrist came back in the middle of my tennis preparation,” she said on Facebook.\n“I therefore have to postpone the start of the season and fully heal my wrist first.”\n“It’s frustrating but I have to keep positive, recover and get ready for the rest of the year. See you in 2025, Australian Open,” added the 27-year-old Czech.\nMuchova injured her right wrist at the US Open in September, where she reached the semifinals.\nIn her best season so far, Muchova also reached the French Open final this year and climbed the WTA rankings from 149th at the end of 2022 to the current eighth spot.\nMuchova’s best result at the Australian Open so far was a semifinal loss in 2021.\nComments\nRelated stories Best quotes from the world of sports in 2023 Swiatek ready for dominant 2024 with eye on Paris Olympics Related Topics Karolina Muchova /\nAustralian Open\nLatest on Sportstar Karolina Muchova to skip Australian Open over wrist injury AFP Top controversies in 2023: Sexual assault allegations against Brij Bhushan to Mathews’ timed out in World Cup Team Sportstar IND vs SA: South Africa captain Bavuma ruled out of second Test against India, Elgar to lead side P.

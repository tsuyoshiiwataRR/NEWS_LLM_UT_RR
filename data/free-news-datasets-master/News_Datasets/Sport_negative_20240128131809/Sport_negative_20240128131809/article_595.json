    "text": "The Cleveland [Browns are preparing](https://clutchpoints.com/browns-news-cleveland-fans-rock-nsfw-joe-flacco-shirts-jets-showdown) to take on the [New York Jets](/nfl/new-york-jets) for a heated Thursday Night Football matchup. However, it sounds like they'll be without star wideout, [Amari Cooper](/tag/amari-cooper), as he's dealing with an injury. Amari Cooper was [officially ruled out](https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1740520091236597922?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) of the game due to heel, per Adam Schefter of ESPN. The Browns will likely rely on Elijah Moore and David Njoku in the passing game against the Jets. “Browns' WR Amari Cooper is inactive tonight vs. the Jets.” This comes right after Cooper went ballistic in Week 16. So, it's a brutal blow for Cleveland who still have the playoffs in their sights. The Browns might have to get creative on Thursday night without their star receiver in the lineup. Especially considering they're facing a stout Jets defense. Cooper looked like one of the best wide receivers in the league in Week 16. Joe Flacco found him early and often. The Browns wide receiver finished that game with 11 receptions, 265 yards, and two touchdowns. The Houston Texans had no answers for Amari Cooper that game. It'll be interesting to see [how the Browns](https://clutchpoints.com/browns-news-kevin-stefanski-dan-campbell-coach-of-the-year-favorite) adjust without Cooper in the lineup. This team has dealt with a plethora of injuries this season that has nearly plagued their playoff chances. But they're still here and fighting for a spot in the postseason. They're kind of like that 2021 Tennessee Titans team who was hit hard with injuries but still made a playoff appearance. With that said, look for Kevin Stefanski to make the necessary adjustments against the Jets on Thursday night. If the Browns can earn a win without Amari Cooper in the lineup, then Cleveland will have all the momentum in the world heading into the final week of the regular season.",

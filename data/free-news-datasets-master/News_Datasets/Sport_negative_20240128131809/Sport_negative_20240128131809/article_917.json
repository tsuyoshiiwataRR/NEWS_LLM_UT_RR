    "text": "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — Despite mounting a strong run at the start of the second half, the Clarkson women’s basketball team was unable to overcome an early deficit, falling 57-44 to Kalamazoo College on Thursday afternoon in the first game of the Sunshine Shootout at the Ocean Center in Daytona Beach.\nThe Golden Knights rattled off the first nine points of the third quarter to pull within 33-30 on an inside basket from Bella Doyle converted inside as for the first five minutes they held the opposition scoreless from the field.\nBut the Hornets scored lay-ups on three consecutive possessions to seize command as Clarkson (2-7) didn’t get any closer than nine points in the fourth quarter.\nThe opportunistic Golden Knights recorded 14 steals in the game, including five from Cassidy Dumont. Dumont finished with 14 points and Addie Kea recorded a double-double thanks to 11 points and 13 rebounds, with five on the offensive glass. Doyle also contributed 13 points and blocked two shots.\nSara English scored all of her game-high 20 points in the first half, including making six 3-pointers for Kalamazoo (3-9), and Jordan Wesaw chipped in with 18 points and 10 rebounds.\nClarkson will play Amherst College at noon on Friday on the second and final day of the Sunshine Shootout.\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.

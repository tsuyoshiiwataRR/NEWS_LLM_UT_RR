    "text": "Tottenham fell to a 4-2 defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion on Thursday night in the Premier League. Ange Postecoglou made two changes to the team that beat Everton at the weekend, with Oliver Skipp ruled out with a knock although expected to be back for the New Year's Eve match at home against Bournemouth. Postecoglou had nine first team players unavailable for the trip to the Amex Stadium and that meant a bench mostly full of youngsters. Tottenham were looking for a victory to get back into the top four after Manchester City leapfrogged them with their win against Everton on Wednesday night. However, Brighton took the lead within 12 minutes against Spurs' makeshift backline. It was too easy for Joao Pedro to dribble across the edge of the Spurs box past a few challenges and he knocked the ball to Jack Hinshelwood to lash home a powerful strike. They doubled their advantage after the referee Jarred Gillett was advised to go to his pitchside monitor after Dejan Kulusevski grabbed Danny Welbeck by the shirt and hauled him back as he was trying to shoot. The penalty was given and dispatched by Joao Pedro. Spurs began probing for a goal back but were punched in the gut by Brighton's third, a dipping strike from distance from Pervis Estupinan which nestled in the far corner. Then the hosts got a fourth after a lunging tackle by Giovani Lo Celso on Evan Ferguson resulted in a penalty which Pedro again scored. Tottenham did get a goal back as Alejo Veliz scored his first goal for the club. Son Heung-min picked him out after a Kulusevski tackle and the young Argentine bounced home a shot. Then Ben Davies added another, heading in Pedro Porro's cross. spurs had late chances, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hitting the post late on but they could not find a way back.

Beaten by the power of Inshelwood's strike soon after but then saved Pedro's effort. Made a one vs one save from the same player after having been sent the wrong by Pedro's penalty earlier on. Couldn't do anything about Estupinan's superb shot from distance and then got sent the wrong way by Pedro again from the spot. Conceded four goals but it could have been so much more in that first half but for his flurry of top drawer saves. 8 Pedro Porro Played a loose pass that put Pedro away for a big chance late in the first half. Had a tough night down the right up against Pedro for much of it. He did grab a late assist with his cross for Davies. 5 Emerson Royal Looked like a full-back trying to play at centre-back, which to be fair to him is exactly what he is. It just didn't work on this occasion as he struggled with Porro in dealing with Pedro. 4 Ben Davies Seemed to be trying to defend by himself at times as the backline went AWOL and headed in a late goal for Spurs with a fine effort on the run. 6 Destiny Udogie Back in the team and had a chance to score in the second half but was denied by Steele. Not his best performance on his return. 5 Pape Matar Sarr Some bright moments on the ball but also plenty of sloppy ones and he was replaced midway through the second half. 4 Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg Plenty of hustle and bustle without any real impact in the match in the first half. Was better as the second half wore on and hit the right-hand post with a late shot which could have set up a big last few minutes had it bounced in. 5 Dejan Kulusevski Gifted Brighton a penalty by grabbing Welbeck's shirt in the box and earned himself the fifth yellow card of the season that means he misses the match against Bournemouth. His tackle set up the play for Veliz's goal and the Swede took Dunk's studs to his ankle in the process. 5 Brennan Johnson Had an opportunity when running through in the first half but hesitated and fluffed his effort. Threatened to make an impact but never really did. 4 Richarlison Struck the left-hand post in the first half with a deflected shot and had two efforts ruled out for offside. Worked hard before coming off in the second half. 5 Son Heung-min Struggled to make an impact in the first half but did grab an assist late in the game for Veliz's goal. 5 Subs Giovani Lo Celso Gave away a penalty with a lunge on Ferguson but did contribute to Spurs' improved attacking late in the game. 5 Bryan Gil Tried to make an impact on the encounter but didn't. 4 Alejo Veliz Grabbed his first goal for the club with a bouncing effort which he was understandably delighted with. Had another smart turn and shot blocked. A good little cameo from the young striker. 7 Join the football.london Spurs WhatsApp community Sign up to our Tottenham WhatsApp service and get all the latest breaking news and in-depth stories from football.london's dedicated Tottenham writers direct to your phone.

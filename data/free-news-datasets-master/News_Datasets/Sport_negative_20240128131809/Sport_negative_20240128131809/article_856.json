    "text": "On Wednesday, Georgia football offensive line coach Stacey Searels was announced to have been hospitalized with pneumonia after not traveling with the team to Miami, Florida. Searelsis expected to make a full recovery.\nSearels is in his second year with Georgia as the team’s offensive line coach and has helped the unit be finalists for the Joe Moore Award — which is given to the best offensive line unit in college football — for the past two seasons.\nGeorgia offensive analyst Manrey Saint-Amour will step in during Searels’ absence. Saint-Amour was previously an offensive line coach at Charleston Southern in 2022 and served as an offensive line graduate assistant at both Alabama and Florida State before then. Saint-Amour was formerly a center with Georgia Southern, in which he made 36 career starts and was a first-team All-Sun Belt selection as a senior in 2014.\nWhile Searels didn’t travel, new Georgia defensive backs coach Donte Williams did travel with the team and was coaching the secondary at practice.\nAdditionally, certain players did not travel with the team. Right tackle Amarius Mims did not travel with the team and will seemingly not play on Saturday. Tight end Brock Bowers is working back from his ankle injury, but the tight ends coach Todd Hartley said he may play if he returns to full health. Freshman edge rusher Damon Wilson Jr. also didn’t travel due to receiving knee surgery.\nWhile those three did not make the trip, several others did, including several incoming freshmen that have been practicing with the team leading up to the trip.\nCornerback Daniel Harris and kicker Jared Zirkel, who both entered the transfer portal, also made the trip down and unlike those previously mentioned, can play.\nBoth Ladd McConkey and Julian Humphrey were both questionable to play in this game due to injury, but both were on the field. Humphrey was specifically in a black non-contact jersey, while McConkey wasn’t, signaling that the redshirt junior would likely play on Saturday against the Seminoles. McConkey confirmed on Thursday that he will play.\nWhile Georgia seemingly only has one hold-out in Mims, Florida State’s holdouts include Keon Coleman, Johnny Wilson, tight end Jaheim Bell and running back Trey Benson on offense and defensive lineman Fabien Lovett and Jared Verse and cornerback Akeem Dent on defense. Quarterback Tate Rodemaker, who initially started for injured starter Jordan Travis, will also not play after entering the transfer portal.\nFreshman Brock Glenn, who started in the ACC Championship and had a rough performance, will make his second start against Georgia. Against Louisville, Glenn had an abysmal 38% completion rate, 55 yards and no touchdowns.\nBoth teams will be working with depleted quarterback rooms after transfers departed the team. Georgia likely holds the advantage with returning starter Carson Beck alongside most of the team returning.",

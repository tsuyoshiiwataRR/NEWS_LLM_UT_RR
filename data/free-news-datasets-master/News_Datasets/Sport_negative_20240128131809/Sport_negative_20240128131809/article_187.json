    "text": "Brighton blew away Tottenham with a footballing force as strong as Storm Gerrit to end the club's best ever year in crazy style.\nAlbion have followed their best ever Premier League finish and highest points tally by reaching the Europa League last 16 on their European debut. And despite 10 players out through injury, Jack Hinshelwood and Joao Pedro scored before half-time.\nWhen Tottenham were finally threatening to make it a contest after the break, Robert De Zerbi sent on Pervis Estupinan to fire home a thunderbolt into the top corner before a second penalty from Brazilian striker Pedro - giving the hosts a 4-0 lead.\nBrighton have still to keep a first clean sheet in 23 matches after late goals from Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies set up an unexpectedly nervy finish. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hit the post during nine minutes of second-half injury time.\nBut the scoreline did not reflect the one-sided contest between two European contenders as Brighton won only a third Premier League game in 13. The form of early leaders Tottenham has been as unpredictable as the December weather with a long unbeaten start followed by five winless games and three victories.\nThe transfer window cannot open soon enough for Ange Postecoglou with captain Son Heung-min now heading off on Asia Cup duty to add to his selection headaches .\nThis fixture between two of the Premier League's most entertaining teams always promised goals. Danny Welbeck was twice denied in the opening six minutes by Guglielmo Vicario before the inevitable breakthrough came after only 11 minutes.\nHinshelwood scored his first senior goal to seal Brighton’s last win over Brentford earlier this month. And the teenager showed he is a lucky charm for the Albion by lashing home after Pedro’s run across to set the Seagulls on the way to another victory.\nWhat did you make of Tottenham's display against Brighton? Let us know in the comments below!\nJan Paul van Hecke headed against the post from a Pascal Gross corner before Dejan Kulusevksi stopped Welbeck converting the loose ball with a shirt pull. Referee Jarred Gillett missed the offence, but it was so blatant that Pedro waited on the penalty spot while the referee reviewed the footage.\nJames Milner hit the post, Facundo Buonanotte had another strike disallowed for offside and Vicario saved from Pedro before the break against the ragged Spurs defence. Christian Romero had joined Tottenham's injury list with a hamstring strain so Emerson Royal moved into central defence and Destiny Udogie returned from suspension at left-back. They couldn’t be as bad after the break and they weren’t after feeling the half-time wrath of Postecoglou.\nRicharlison had two finishes ruled out for offside in the opening minutes of the second half before the Brazilian was also booked for pushing Pedro in the throat. After 56 minutes, Destiny Udogie forced Jason Steele into his first save.\nEstupinan picked up a short corner from Milner and fired home from 25 yards. Jakub Moder then fed his fellow sub Evan Ferguson before Giovani Lo Celso made a crazy challenge from behind. Pedro sent Vicario the wrong again for his 13th goal of the season.\nKulusevksi robbed Lewis Dunk for Son to set up sub Veliz for his first Spurs goal after 81 minutes. And Davies headed home a second from a Pedro Porro cross.\nJoin our new WhatsApp community! Click this link to receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

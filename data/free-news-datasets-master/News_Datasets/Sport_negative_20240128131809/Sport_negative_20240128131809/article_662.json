    "text": "Arsenal closed matchday number 19 of the 2023/2024 Premier League with a defeat, and fell 2-0 at home at the Emirates Stadium against West Ham United, thus losing the possibility of regaining the lead in the standings. Although they dominated and had many chances, those led by Mikel Arteta, especially Saka, did not know how to finish the plays when defining and quickly found themselves at a disadvantage. In the end, the visitors did take advantage of the few scoring opportunities they generated and were left with the 3 points.

Aston Villa – 39 points 7. Manchester United – 31 puntos. There are 19 games left in the Premier League, which is the most competitive and attractive local league championship in the world . Colombian Luis Fernando Díaz Marulanda’s Liverpool was proclaimed the winter champion. Now, with a minimal advantage in the standings, they will have to maintain the lead with good results to be able to lift the title as such at the end of the season. It is worth mentioning that the club led by the German Jürgen Klopp is not playing in the Uefa Champions League, so it will be able to give all its attention to the Premier. It will be complex to maintain the numerical advantage and remain first in the Premier table, but it will not be impossible. For now, the path to the title is being won by Liverpool, but clearly Arsenal (two points away), Aston Villa (three points away) and Manchester City (five points away and with one game less) will do what is necessary to lower Lucho Díaz’s team from the lead.

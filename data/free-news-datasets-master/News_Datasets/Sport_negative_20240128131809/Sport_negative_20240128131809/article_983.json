    "text": "Edwards Scores First of the Year as Otters Fall 3-1\nDecember 28, 2023 -\nOntario Hockey League (OHL) - Erie Otters News Release\nGuelph, Ontario - Happy Holidays! After 12 days between their last and next games, the well-rested Erie Otters would kick off the proverbial second-half of the season by heading to a Midwest Division foe, the Guelph Storm. Erie and Guelph met earlier in the month of December, with the former taking a 4-1 victory at the Erie Insurance Arena. The Otters would hope to rekindle some of that game's result, as they looked for their first win at the Sleeman Centre since February 2020 - and to get back into a win-streak after seeing their four-game streak snapped prior to the break.\nIn the most prevalent error to open the game, Erie would earn three power play opportunities in the opening frame, but be unable to convert any of the three man-advantages into goals. On home ice, Guelph would strike for first blood 9:43 in thanks to Jake Karabella (9, PPG) with a reviewed goal that was just below the crossbar without being a high-stick. On the other side of a media timeout, Guelph would see Charlie Paquette (10) race 200 feet down the ice to net the second goal of the game. Erie would appear to be held scoreless in the first, but with 2.4 seconds left, it would be Ready Eddy to cut the Erie deficit in half, as Dylan Edwards (1) would score at point-blank range to make it a 2-1 game. Erie and Guelph would be knotted up in shots 13-13.\nWhere goals wouldn't come at too much of a cost in the opening 20, the middle 20 would not allow any to come by, as both team's defenses would limit shot opportunities, and the respective goaltenders would do their jobs perfectly. Each team would receive a power play opportunity, but be unable to convert - putting Erie at 0/4 on the man-advantage through 40. Erie would outshoot Guelph 8-5 in the period, but remain down in a 2-1 contest.\nPenalties and glove-droppings would be the biggest theme of the final frame, as 10 total penalties would be assessed in the last 20. Included in the mix would be the gloves being dropped by captain Spencer Sova and Sam Alfano at varying points. The third period would be the lone period Erie would be outshot, falling 10-9 in the shot category. With just over seven minutes remaining, it would be Max Namestnikov (18) to put the game away for Guelph as the Storm would take and hold onto a 3-1 lead. Erie would finish 0/6 on the power play, and see its woes continue at the Sleeman Centre.\nThe Erie Otters close out 2023 on home ice for a highly-anticipated New Year's weekend. The weekend kicks off on Saturday night with Erie Panthers Night (pres. by United Way of Erie County), as the team honors Erie's last professional hockey team. With the return of the Panthers' black jerseys for one-night-only, team alumni in attendance and sending special messages for the video board, and the first 2000 fans in attendance receiving a Erie Panthers Pennant (pres. by United Way of Erie County), it'll be the perfect way and day to re-live the days of the Tullio Arena. On Sunday, the return of an Erie holiday tradition counts down the start of 2024 with New Year's Rockin' Eve (pres. by Printing Concepts). With a photo booth around the concourse and the first 1500 fans in attendance receiving their very own 2024 Erie Otters Player Calendar (pres. by Printing Concepts), you'll want to be there when the puck drops before the ball does.\nErie Otters Statistics\nâ€¢ Discuss this story on the\nOntario Hockey League message board...\nOntario Hockey League Stories from December 28, 2023\n-\nSpitfires Go Ice Fishing; Win 5-3 Over Steelheads- Windsor Spitfires\n-\nO'Brien & Okitundu Lead Bulldogs to 5-4 Win in Oshawa- Brantford Bulldogs\n-\nEdwards Scores First of the Year as Otters Fall 3-1- Erie Otters\n-\nMcCue Scores 10th in Petes' Loss to Frontenacs- Peterborough Petes\n-\nBulldogs Sign Top Prospect Briir Long- Brantford Bulldogs\n-\nReturn from Break Sees Greyhounds Visit Saginaw- Saginaw Spirit\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.\nOther Recent Erie Otters Stories\n-\nEdwards Scores First of the Year as Otters Fall 3-1\n-\nOtters' Early Goals Not Enough in 4-2 Loss\n-\nDepth-Scorers Step up as Otters Win Fourth-Straight\n-\nSpecial Teams Shines Over Guelph, Otters Win Third-Straight\n-\nOtters Play Near-Perfect Road Game, Penalty Kill Shines in 4-1 Road Win",

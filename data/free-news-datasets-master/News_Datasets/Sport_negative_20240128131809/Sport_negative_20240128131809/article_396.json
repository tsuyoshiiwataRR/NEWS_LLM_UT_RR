    "text": "Dec. 27—LEBANON — The Lebanon girls basketball team lost a heartbreaker in the opening game of their annual holiday tournament Wednesday afternoon.\nPerry Meridian topped the Lady Tigers 36-35, with the Tigers missing the second of two free throws with 1.5 seconds left that would have sent the game to overtime.\n\"It comes down to turnovers again, and wanting the ball in our hands,\" Lebanon head coach Candice Huckstep said. \"We need someone out there stepping up and being a leader, and we don't have that right now. We knew this was going to be close, and free throws hurt us too, but it doesn't come down to that last possession. It just comes down to taking care of the ball, boxing out, and it was just disappointing.\"\nAfter a Ciarra Hiatt basket with six seconds left cut the deficit to 35-34, Perry Meridian's Mariah Thomas was fouled and went to the line.\nAfter making the first free throw, she missed the second and Lebanon's Claire Boling was fouled with 1.5 seconds left and had a chance to tie the game.\nShe made the first, but the second rimmed out and Perry Meridian got the rebound to seal the win.\n\"It unfortunately just didn't fall,\" Huckstep said. \"We do a lot of pressure free throws in practice. Again, it didn't come down to that free throw. Obviously, we would have loved for it to go in, but it didn't come down to that one shot.\"\nIt a tough end to what had been a back-and-forth game throughout.\nLebanon led 29-26 at the end of three quarters, and took a 31-26 lead after a basket by Jade Mount.\nPerry Meridian tied the game at 31, and after a free throw by Lebanon's Emily Sperry, the Falcons scored the next four points to go up 35-32.\nThe Tigers had the ball down three with 45 seconds to go, and had a lengthy possession where they had three attempts at the basket, but settled for Hiatt's two-pointer on a putback prior to the final seconds.\n\"We tried to let them to play through it a little bit,\" Huckstep said. \"We had a game earlier this year where we didn't call timeout and it didn't work, and then the next time we did call timeout and that didn't work, so we have had it both ways. We were struggling to get the ball in and we thought it was best to let them play through.\"\nThe Tigers trailed 11-7 after a quarter, but dominated the second eight minutes.\nLebanon held the Falcons to just two points, and took a six point lead into the locker room.\nThe Tigers led by as many as eight on a 3-pointer by Leila Richards, but saw the Falcons close to within three by the end of the quarter.\n\"We have struggled all season with being able to keep a lead,\" Huckstep said. \"There have been several games where we have a five, six, seven point leads and then just have too many turnovers and make bad decisions. Some of our decisions we are still making at this point of the season is a little disappointing.\"\nMarina Barr led the Tigers with nine points, with Sperry scoring seven points and grabbing six rebounds.\nHiatt scored six points, with Boling having six points and nine rebounds.\nThe Tigers will now play in the consolations, facing Lafayette Jeff at 4 p.m. Wednesday.\n\"It's going to be all about mental toughness,\" Huckstep said. \"We have to come in with a good mindset and listen to what we are trying to tell them coaching wise. The little details are going to matter against Lafayette Jeff. We played them in a scrimmage earlier this season, so we know a little about them and we know they aren't going to take it easy on us.\"\nWill Willems is the Sports Editor of the Lebanon Reporter.

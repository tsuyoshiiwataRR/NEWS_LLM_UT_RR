    "text": "usatsi_21719188-1\nNot even Michigan, the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff, is immune to losing players to the transfer portal.\nWith just four days until the Wolverines’ Rose Bowl game vs. No. 4 Alabama, Jim Harbaugh’s football program has suffered a pretty significant loss.\nCameron Calhoun, a former four-star cornerback recruit in the 2022 cycle, is leaving the program to enter the NCAA transfer portal. Calhoun was the No. 33 overall cornerback in his class, per 247Sports. The 6-foot, 173-pound defensive back and Cincinnati native appeared in two games for Michigan against UNLV and Bowling Green.\nCalhoun likely wanted to stay on Harbaugh’s team for the rest of the College Football Playoff experience. But the college football calendar isn’t kind to players on CFP teams who may want to play elsewhere next season.\nMichigan takes on Alabama in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1 at 5 p.m. ET. The winner advances to the national title where it’ll play the winner of Washington vs. Texas.\nIt’ll be interesting, meanwhile, to see where Calhoun ends up playing next season.",

    "text": "Sunday’s AFC showdown between the Baltimore Ravens and the Miami Dolphins might come down to which team is the healthiest. If that’s the case, the Dolphins are playing from behind already. The health concerns begin for both teams at the receiver position, as the No. 2 seed Miami Dolphins (11-4) prepare to play the No. 1 Baltimore Ravens (12-3) on Sunday in Baltimore. Miami’s Jaylen Waddle (ankle) and Baltimore’s Zay Flowers (calf) did not practice for the second straight day Thursday . According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, Waddle is not expected to play Sunday . While one report said Waddle’s injury isn’t “overly severe ,” he was seen leaving the locker room Wednesday in a walking boot. Meanwhile, Flowers was also wearing short walking boot Wednesday after getting injured in the Ravens’ 33-19 victory over San Francisco, a game in which the rookie receiver caught nine passes for 72 yards and one touchdown. Other than Flowers, safety Kyle Hamilton, who had two interceptions against the 49ers, has been limited in practice this week while nursing a re-aggravated MCL sprain. Related: NFL power rankings: Evaluating all 32 teams after 16 games The Miami Dolphins’ significant injuries extend beyond Waddle, who surpassed the 1,000-yard receiving mark for the third time in three seasons and has been critical to the Dolphins’ No. 1 rated passing attack while star receiver Tyreek Hill has dealt with a recent ankle injury. Like Waddle, Mostert (knee/ankle) didn’t practice Wednesday or Thursday, but he is expected to suit up and play Sunday . The 31-year-old back, tied with the 49ers’ Christian McCaffrey for the NFL lead in touchdowns (21), has dealt with injuries all season and has played in all 15 games during a career-best year, which includes 1,012 yards rushing. At the same time, Hill, running back De’Von Achane (toe) and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa were limited participants in practice Thursday. Given the length of each team’s injury list, Sunday’s game could be a war of attrition as the two teams battle for supremacy in the AFC. The Ravens will clinch the No. 1 seed with a victory, while the Dolphins, who still have a 24-percent chance of getting the No. 1 seed, will secure the AFC East title with a win. More must-reads:",

The Chiefs have lost three of their last four games. Shiffrin made tough course conditions look easy. The Chiefs haven't been the most trust-worthy team for fantasy managers this season, but our analysts believe that will change in Week 17. LSU and South Carolina have different roster makeups than when they won their respective titles, but they still have NCAA championship potential and are the two favorites to win the SEC. Tampa Bay is a practical lock to win the NFC South. From scandal and scorn to Big Ten triumph, Jim Harbaugh's Michigan tenure has been anything but boring. There's an expanded 12-team field to look forward to next season, but we're first looking back at the best games of the four-team playoff era. Don't count out the Dolphins against a very good Ravens team. It's another jam packed edition of 'Stat Nerd Thursday' with Dalton Del Don and Matt Harmon. The two provide one stat you need to know for every team in the NFL heading into Week 17. Del Don and Harmon also preview the TNF matchup between the New York Jets and Cleveland Browns. West Virginia easily beat North Carolina 30-10. At the time of his injury, Rhamondre Stevenson led the Patriots in rushing yards and receptions Stars tend to shine during Championship Week.

Alexander will miss Sunday's game against the Vikings. The Big Ten will again be Caitlin Clarkâ€™s playground as opposing defenses try to find solutions for the senior and her NCAA-leading 30.5 points per game. Sam Howell will go to the bench after a terrible slump. Three star players are causing fantasy managers headaches as we head into championship week. Andy Behrens looks to provide some clarity and context. While there's an expanded 12-team field to look forward to next season, let's first look back at the top games of the four-team playoff era.",

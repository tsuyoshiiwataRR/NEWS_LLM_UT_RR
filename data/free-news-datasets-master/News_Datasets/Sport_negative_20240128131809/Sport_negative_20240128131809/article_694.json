    "text": "Arsenal’s Title Contention in Question After West Ham Loss\nArsenal didn’t look like title contenders in West Ham loss\nAfter falling short last season despite holding an eight-point lead at the beginning of April, the principal challenge this time around for manager Mikel Arteta was evolving the Gunners into a more robust proposition to last the pace.\nDefensive Vulnerabilities\nArsenal’s defending was calamitous, leading to both goals, with Gabriel Magalhaes hitting the ball against Oleksandr Zinchenko to give Bowen a chance to pounce. The lack of defensive solidity proved costly for the Gunners.\nLack of Composure in Possession\nWasting chances at one end and conceding another soft goal at the other was a recipe for disaster. Arsenal’s response in possession was troubling, lacking the composure associated with serial title-winners.\nDeclan Rice’s Struggles\nRice, who had excelled for his new club, endured a tough night and even gave away a penalty in stoppage time. His struggles highlighted Arsenal’s regression despite his summer move, raising questions about the team’s After all strength.",

    "text": "Well, that sucked. [Tottenham](https://cartilagefreecaptain.sbnation.com) went south to Brighton on a three match winning streak, but without their only healthy recognized central defender in Cuti Romero, who tweaked his hamstring and is out until the end of January. The idea was that Spurs could get a good result at a tough place to play. Instead they got pumped. Tottenham gave up two penalties (both converted by Joao Pedro) and goals to Jack Hinshelwood and Pervis Estupinian. Tottenham made it interesting late thanks to goals from Alejo Veliz (his first in a Spurs shirt!) and Ben Davies, but couldn’t overcome that early deficit. In truth, it was a pretty putrid performance. And now — It’s time to rate the players. Rate the players from 1⁄2 to 5 stars. If the player doesn’t deserve a rating due to minutes played, DO NOT RANK. I will round the stars up/down to the nearest half-star for the player ratings later this week.

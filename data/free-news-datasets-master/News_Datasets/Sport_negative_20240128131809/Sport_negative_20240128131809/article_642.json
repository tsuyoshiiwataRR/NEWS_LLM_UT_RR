Angeli To Lead Irish Even though they’ll be missing their QB1, the Irish are still the Sun Bowl chalk. Sam Hartman is [opting out](https://www.sportsbettingdime.com/news/ncaaf/2023-college-football-bowl-game-opt-outs-tracker-players-sitting-out-bowls/) of the game to prepare for the NFL Draft. In one season at Notre Dame, the Wake Forest transfer threw for 2,689 yards and 24 touchdowns against eight interceptions. Under center for Notre Dame against Oregon State will be sophomore Steve Angeli. In a mop-up role behind Hartman, Angeli has completed 19 of 25 passes for 272 yards and four touchdowns, while tossing one interception. If Angeli struggles to move the Irish offense, don’t be surprised if Notre Dame hands over the reins of the offense to freshman Kenny Minchey. Marcus Freeman's message to his Sun Bowl starting QB: \"You have to be Steve Angeli. Don’t be Sam Hartman. Don’t be anybody else. Be Steve Angeli.\" [#NDFootball] [#NotreDame] — Mike BerardinoNDI (@MikeBerardino) [December 28, 2023] Two key starters along the OL, LT Joe Alt and RT Blake Fisher, are skipping the game to get ready for the NFL Draft. They’re among 13 Notre Dame players who’ve decided not to suit up. Notre Dame will also be minus offensive coordinator Gerad Parker. He left to accept the head coaching position at Troy. Coaching Change For Beavers Change is also afoot at Oregon State. Head coach Jonathan Smith departed to accept the Michigan State job. Receivers coach Kefense Hynson will be serving as interim head coach for this game. The Beavers will also be turning to their backup QB, albeit a second-stringer with significant first-string experience. With QB1 DJ Uiagalelei entering the transfer portal, Ben Gulbranson will be under center. The last time Ben Gulbranson started a Bowl Game for the Beaver!!! [#GoBeavs] [pic.twitter.com/VrGyTRkpRf] — Sidelines – Oregon State (@SSN_Beavers) [December 4, 2023] Gulbranson was 7-1 SU as Oregon State’s starter last season. He would be named MVP of the Las Vegas Bowl. Five other Beavers are opting out of this game. Protecting Angeli could prove an issue for Notre Dame minus both Irish starting tackles. Oregon State’s defense is tied for ninth in the nation with 36 sacks. Oregon State vs Notre Dame Prediction Considering the disarray and uncertainty on both sides of the football in this game, the best bet here is to go low. Fade the public and take the under on the total of 41.5 points. Remember, Oregon State’s only previous Sun Bowl appearance was a 3-0 victory. Oregon State vs Notre Dame Pick: Under 41.5 points (-110)",

    "text": "New Delhi: The first Test against South Africa was one to forget for India after suffering a defeat by an innings and 32 runs at the SuperSport Park in Centurion. The miserable outing in Centurion also meant that India's hopes of winning a Test series in the rainbow nation for the first time were dished. Looking at India's past record in the red-ball format, it was rare that the Men in Blue suffered an innings defeat. Indian skipper Rohit Sharma stressed on the fact that the side cannot be written off after the thrashing against the Proteas as they have beaten top-notch teams like Australia Down Under and drew a series against England in the last three years. \"Yes, we had a performance like this here. But, don't forget, what we did in Australia and England. In Australia, we won the series, there our batters stepped up. In England, we drew a series, we shone with both bat and ball,\" said the Indian captain during the post-match press conference. Indian skipper fails to fire Rohit, who is known for his batting prowess, was unable to go big at Centurion. In the first innings, the 36-year-old was the first to depart after scoring just five runs in 14 balls. Riding on KL Rahul's gritty knock, India went on to post a total of 245 in their first innings. After South Africa made 408 and established a lead of 163 runs, the second innings became crucial for the Indian batters who could not afford to fail. But Rohit, yet again, became the first to be sent back to the pavilion after being castled by South African speedster Kagiso Rabada for a duck. Apart from Virat Kohli (76), the Indian batters failed to make a mark and crumbled for 131 in their second essay. India's second and final Test against South Africa will be held at Newlands, Cape Town starting from January 3.",

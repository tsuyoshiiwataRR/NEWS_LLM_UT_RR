    "text": "John Stones will undergo further tests on the worrying ankle injury he suffered at Everton on Wednesday, but Manchester City will hope the centre-back avoids a long-term absence.\nThe England international suffered the injury just before half-time, when he stopped Beto, despite the Everton striker being in an offside position.\nThere is dismay at City at the way assistant referees are interpreting the directive to initially keep their flags down in the event of a tight offside, which was introduced with the introduction of VAR.\nWednesday’s offside incident was described as “clear” by Pep Guardiola, but City are unlikely to lodge a complaint with refereeing body PGMOL, even though they are sweating over Stones’ fitness as a result of that the flag remained low.\nCity are yet to determine the severity of Stones’ latest setback, but initial suggestions are that the 29-year-old will miss weeks rather than months.\nManchester City are awaiting test results to see the extent of defender John Stones’ ankle injury.\nStones suffered the injury while attacking Everton striker Beto before half-time.\nPep Guardiola was frustrated that Beto was offside, but play was allowed to continue.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nStones has started just five Premier League games this season after a difficult hip injury early in the campaign.\nHe enlists the help of a private doctor, who works in conjunction with City’s medical team, in a bid to avoid the muscle injuries that have blighted his seven years at the Etihad Stadium.\nCity have missed the Stones this season, keeping just four clean sheets in 18 league games. But his is just one of several injuries Guardiola has had to deal with.\nTop scorer Erling Haaland still only does individual work with the ball and this week complained of discomfort in his foot. He is expected to return to team training soon.\nKevin De Bruyne is also nearing his return after hamstring surgery in August.\nEarly suggestions are that Stones will miss several weeks rather than months.\nIT’S ALL STARTING!\nIt’s All Kicking Off is an exciting new podcast from Mail Sport promising a different take on Premier League football.\nIt is available at MailOnline,\nMail+, Youtube, apple music and Spotify.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nJeremy Doku’s hamstring problem is being carefully treated but the 21-year-old believes he will be ready to return soon. Rubén Dias will recover from his illness for tomorrow’s visit to Sheffield United.\nMeanwhile, captain Kyle Walker wants Phil Foden to be more consistent after he inspired City to Wednesday’s 3-1 win at Goodison Park, in which the 23-year-old scored his ninth goal of the season.\nWalker said: “The talent that kid has is incredible, but with this coach, this team and the caliber of players we have, Phil needs to do it week in, week out.”\n‘Resting a couple of games won’t put you in the caliber of the best footballers in the world. The sky is the limit for him.’",

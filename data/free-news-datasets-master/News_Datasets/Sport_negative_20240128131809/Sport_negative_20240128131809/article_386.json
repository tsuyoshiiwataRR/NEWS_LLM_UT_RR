    "text": "Arsenal couldn't respond against West Ham / Marc Atkins/GettyImages GK: David Raya - 7/10 - Was again quite an anxious presence in the Arsenal box but did at least enjoy a convincing moment late on with the penalty save,\nRB: Ben White - 4/10 - Clipped in some dangerous crosses but rarely went on the outside in attack and was a little lightweight in defence.\nCB: William Saliba - 5/10 - Was dragged out wide before West Ham opened the scoring. Struggled with Bowen's power.\nCB: Gabriel Magalhaes - 5/10 - Played his part in a mishap with Zinchenko and lacked decisiveness in one of his poorer games.\nLB: Oleksandr Zinchenko - 4/10 - Surprisingly bad in possession given his renowned technical ability and also offered little muscle in defence.\nCM: Martin Odegaard - 7/10 - One of Arsenal's brighter sparks, constantly demanding the ball and giving his all in a doomed attempt to get his side back into the game.\nCM: Declan Rice - 6/10 - Was persistent and combative in the middle of the park but was outwitted at crucial moments, even if his late error wasn't punished by Benrahma.\nCM: Leandro Trossard - 5/10 - Played in a deeper midfield role but still got five shots away. Failed to make the most of his opportunities.\nRW: Bukayo Saka - 6/10 - Struck the post and showed no signs of shirking responsibility with nine shots taken, though five of those were blocked.\nST: Gabriel Jesus - 4/10 - Offers plenty in Arsenal's build-up but a steelier edge in front of goal was needed for Arteta's side on Thursday night.\nLW: Gabriel Martinelli - 5/10 - A quiet game and couldn't cause Coufal enough grief before coming off after the hour.\nSubstitutes SUB: Eddie Nketiah (64' for Martinelli) - 6/10\nSUB: Reiss Nelson (64' for Zinchenko) - 5/10\nSUB: Emile Smith Rowe (79' for Trossard) - 5/10\nSubs not used: Aaron Ramsdale, Cedric Soares, Jakub Kiwior, Jorginho, Mohamed Elneny, Ethan Nwaneri.\nManager Mikel Arteta - 4/10 - Arsenal kept battering West Ham but the cool head to convert didn't show up, while Arteta's changes from the bench couldn't inspire any sort of comeback.\nWest Ham United player ratings (4-2-3-1)\nSoucek put West Ham in front / Catherine Ivill/GettyImages GK: Alphonse Areola - 7/10 - Made eight saves in total in a solid display, commanding his box well even if his shot-stopping was flimsy-looking at times.\nRB: Vladimir Coufal - 7/10 - Strong and robust out wide, seeing off the challenge of Martinelli well. Made five headed clearances.\nCB: Konstantinos Mavropanos - 8/10 - Flicked in brilliantly to double West Ham's lead and was on hand to clear danger whenever necessary.\nCB: Angelo Ogbonna - 7/10 - Complemented Mavropanos' assured display by leading the defence and repelling crosses.\nLB: Emerson Palmieri - 7/10 - His cross caused the scramble that led to Soucek's goal, while his endeavour gave Benrahma the chance to make it 3-0, though that opportunity was wasted.\nCM: Edson Alvarez - 7/10 - A tower of strength in the middle of the park, making five tackles.\nCM: Tomas Soucek - 7/10 - Got into the box to pounce on the loose ball and score and also did his bit in the defensive third.\nRW: Mohammed Kudus - 7/10 - Won the ball back nine times for West Ham in a great defensive showing, though didn't get many chances to show his talent in the final third.\nAM: James Ward-Prowse - 7/10 - Wicked delivery from wide areas proved crucial as he assisted Mavropanos' header.\nLW: Lucas Paqueta - 6/10 - Had some fleeting involvements before a suspected hamstring injury brought his evening to a premature end.\nST: Jarrod Bowen - 7/10 - Showed great ingenuity to set up Soucek's opener and didn't give Arsenal's centre-backs any time to rest or settle.\nSubstitutes SUB: Said Benrahma (33' for Paqueta) - 5/10 - Missed the penalty late on which would have really sweetened West Ham's victory.\nSubs not used: Lukasz Fabianski, Ben Johnson, Aaron Cresswell, Pablo Fornals, Maxwel Cornet, Danny Ings, Thilo Kehrer, Divin Mubama.\nManager David Moyes - 9/10 - Questions are constantly asked over Moyes' future with his West Ham contract up at the end of the season, but with recent wins over Tottenham, Man Utd and now Arsenal, he's due some respite from all that unwanted attention.",

    "text": "Cocaine use among football fans at games reamins rife\nFootball clubs and police are failing to take a rise in fan cocaine use seriously enough, according to MPs demanding tougher laws against disorder.\nThe Culture Media and Sport Committee also recommends new legislation around unauthorised entry to prevent chaos seen at the Euro 2020 final. Since the Wembley final in which fans openly snorted white powder, authorities gained powers to impose Football Banning Orders for drug possession. The UK courts last season issued 682 new football banning orders –the highest since 2010/11 – in large part due to the new legislation.\nHowever, the Westminster committee suggest “further work is needed by the police to understand the prevalence of drug supply and possession” at football.\n“The increasing use of Class A drugs at sporting events is something that police and clubs should both be taking more seriously,” the MPs conclude. “It is unclear whether the use of Football Banning Orders for Class A drugs provides an adequate deterrent.”\nThe CMS Committee completed its inquiry into spectator safety issues following trouble seen at Wembley, and the problems encountered by Liverpool fans as a result of safety failures by authorities at last year’s Champions League final in Paris.\nThe Euro 2020 final between England and Italy saw fans without tickets attempting to gain entry to Wembley either with fake tickets, tailgating or by force. There is currently no distinct criminal offence regarding unauthorised entry to a stadium, and the Committee has called on the Government to back a bill introduced by committee member Kevin Brennan MP which would create an offence and allow a football banning order to be imposed on conviction.\nDame Caroline Dinenage MP, chair of the committee, said: “Tailgating and other forms of unauthorised entry into grounds are an increasing problem at high-profile matches putting safety at risk from overcrowding.\n“Those involved should know that they will face consequences and the Government should back legislation to ensure they can be banned.”\nThe issues seen in Paris last summer were very different, with the authorities found to be at fault for major problems around the Stade de France despite their attempts to pin the blame on Liverpool supporters.\nSeveral fans were denied entry despite having legitimate tickets for Liverpool’s match against Real Madrid, while police also used pepper spray and tear gas. The committee called the treatment Liverpool fans received “disgraceful” and said the attitude of foreign police forces towards British fans was a significant factor.\nDinenage added: “At big games in Europe, too often the attitude of foreign police to British fans leads to unacceptable treatment of innocent supporters. The Government needs to work with overseas counterparts to bolster the role of British police travelling with teams and collaboration with local forces.”\n%n\nDiscover Telegraph Wine Cellar’s new wine club.

Recently, fans reacted to a new report on the popular star and questioned the company's decision behind the signing and booking of the star.\nEarlier this year, WWE started utilizing stars who barely got any time to wrestle on weekly television. One such star was Zelina Vega, who joined the Latino World Order and was featured weekly following her title match against Rhea Ripley at WWE Backlash 2023.\nHowever, Vega was often booked on the losing end and spent her time managing the members of the faction. Recently, it was reported that she signed a multi-year deal with the promotion. Some fans weren't thrilled at the news and gave their opinion of the star's current run.\nCheck out some reactions below:\nExpand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet The nature of the deal was not revealed, but WWE recently signed several wrestlers, such as Dominik Mysterio, Rey Mysterio, Charlotte Flair, and Bayley.

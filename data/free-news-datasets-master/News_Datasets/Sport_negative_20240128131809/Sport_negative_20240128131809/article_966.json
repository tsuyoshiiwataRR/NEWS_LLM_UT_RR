    "text": "Cleveland Browns wider receiver Elijah Moore appeared to twitch involuntarily on the ground before being ruled out of Thursday night's NFL game against the Jets with concussion. Moore appeared to hit the ground face down after being tackled by Jets No 57 C. J. Mosely with one minute and 44 seconds remaining in the second quarter of Thursday night's game. Moore had part of the turf from the field in his grill and as the camera filmed him lying on his back, his arms and hands seemed to scarily jolt up into the air. His worried teammates beckoned to the sidelines to get the trainers onto the field while Mosely appeared to carefully step up and around his opponent. The 23-year-old was later ruled out of the game with concussion. Really scary moment for Elijah Moore, who looks like he started seizing after the hit. Hope he is okay. pic.twitter.com/IOZ6apzwil Elijah Moore appeared to jolt involuntarily after being tackled face-down to the ground Moore was tackled to the ground by Jets linebacker C.J. Mosely during Thursday's game Moore's teammates stand around him as he is treated on the field in concerning scenes The incident sparked a number of concerned responses from doctors who were watching the game. Dr Evan Jefferies, a California-based doctor of physical therapy, wrote on X: 'Unfortunately those are involuntary movements from a brain Injury for Elijah Moore.' Jeff Mueller, another physical therapy doctor, wrote: 'Involuntary limb movement occurs when thereâ€™s disruption between the brain and the muscles. 'Every concussion is different but could be a multi-week absence for Moore.' A lengthy absence for Moore would be a major blow for him and his team with the playoffs on the horizon. The 37-20 victory for the Browns on Thursday clinched a place in the playoffs. The team has 10 days before its last game of the regular season, on the road to Cincinnati Bengals. The Wild Card round of the playoffs begins on January 13.",

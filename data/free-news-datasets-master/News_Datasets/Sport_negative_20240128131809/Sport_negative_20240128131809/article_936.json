    "text": "One week after cracking the top-20 greatest single-game receiving performances with his explosion vs. the Texans, Amari Cooper is set to miss out on the action. The Browns star — who tallied up a franchise record 265 yards last weekend — was ruled out of Cleveland's Week 16 contest vs. the Jets on \"Thursday Night Football\" after sustaining a heel injury, according to NFL Network's [Mike Garafolo](https://twitter.com/mikegarafolo/status/1740520075315253550?s=46&t=uqYSnrlrtO-BBz0LWXwF8Q). Cooper is one of Joe Flacco's favorite targets and looked poised for a marquee matchup with New York star Sauce Gardner in the secondary. Kevin Stefanski's side now looks to clinch a postseason berth without its leading receiver, an already formidable task given the Jets' swarming defense. LIVE: [Browns take on Jets as Cleveland looks to clinch playoff berth on 'TNF'](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/jets-browns-live-score-highlights-thursday-night-football/363b8bf15ba889110fff9906) Here's the latest on Cooper's status going forward. Amari Cooper injury update Cooper left Sunday's game vs. Houston with a whole lot in his possession. He posted one of the greatest receiving displays in modern NFL history, joining Tyreek Hill, Antonio Brown and Calvin Johnson as players to have surpassed 260 receiving yards in a single game. That didn't mean he didn't have battle scars, however. The reigning AFC Offensive Player of the Week suffered a heel ailment in last week's clash. After failing to take part in any of Cleveland's three practices this week, Cooper was deemed questionable to play in Thursday's festivities. It seems he attempted to give things a go during warmups. However, the Browns star receiver sensed something wasn't right. He and Cleveland took the sensible approach of waiting until Cooper was closer to fitness to return to the field. For fantasy owners, that's not necessarily a good thing.

His absence could loom large for Flacco and Co., especially against New York's menacing backline. The Jets are surrendering the seventh-worst completion percentage against opposition quarterbacks in the league as is. Without Cooper, a vertical threat capable of drawing attention deep in the flat, things could get challenging for Flacco on Thursday night. Browns WR depth chart With Cooper away, expect the likes of Elijah Moore and Cedric Tillman to be more involved in the passing game. Tight end David Njoku is likely to be a safety valve for Flacco; he's Cleveland's second-leading receiver this year, tallying up 75 catches for 748 yards and six touchdowns so far. Marquise Goodwin, listed as Cooper's official backup on the depth chart, was a limited practice participant throughout the week. He's still slated to play, however.",

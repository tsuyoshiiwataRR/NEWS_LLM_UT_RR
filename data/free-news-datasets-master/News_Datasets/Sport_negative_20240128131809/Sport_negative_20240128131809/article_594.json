    "text": "Miami football is ready to move on from an overall unsuccessful season that is defined by mind-boggling mistakes and unmet expectations. But no one seems to be in a bigger hurry to get to 2024 than Mario Cristobal, following his questionable decision-making in the Pinstripe Bowl versus Rutgers. The Hurricanes head coach hung onto his two remaining timeouts instead of attempting to get the ball back from the Scarlet Knights in the closing seconds. Miami would have still needed a miracle, but that is something any team should willingly accept when faced with terrible odds. Moreover, the Canes might not have even been in this unfavorable position had Cristobal exercised better time management throughout the game- which was one they ultimately lost, 31-24. These miscues come after the former Miami offensive tackle (1989-92) [opted not to execute](https://clutchpoints.com/miami-football-news-mario-cristobal-explains-botched-decision-blew-hurricanes-win-vs-georgia-tech) a quarterback kneel in what should have been a surefire victory over Georgia Tech back in October. The Hurricanes fumbled and the Yellow Jackets made them pay with an unlikely touchdown drive. Frustration has festered since then, but the ending of Thursday's bowl game somehow leaves everyone [even more bewildered](https://twitter.com/IraHeatBeat/status/1740505398275350651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1740505398275350651%7Ctwgr%5E329e9d359d8836bb6bdbb85ae21ff1abb683bf31%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.clutchpoints.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2611634action%3Dedit). Mario Cristobal will have two timeouts to use in the offseason after Miami loses a one-score game in which the Hurricanes had the ball last. ‚Äî Barrett Sallee üá∫üá∏ (@BarrettSallee) [December 28, 2023] I do not understand how Mario Cristobal can be in charge of this program in the morning. ‚Äî Ian Hest (@IanHest) [December 28, 2023] Wondering what Mario Cristobal is going to do with those two spare timeouts next season? Are there any offseason game- management online classes available? ‚Äî Ira Winderman (@IraHeatBeat) [December 28, 2023] I wonder what Mario Cristobal is going to do with those timeouts in the offseason. Maybe take them to Six Flags, get a nice selfie with them on a roller coaster. ‚Äî Zach Barnett (@zach_barnett) [December 28, 2023] Mario Cristobal returned to Miami to set records and he certainly has after guiding the Hurricanes to their first loss against Rutgers in program history. The Scarlet Knights were previously 0-11 against the U. [#Noles] [pic.twitter.com/J61UQA340J] ‚Äî Dustin Lewis (@DustinLewisNG) [December 28, 2023] ‚ÄúWondering what Mario Cristobal is going to do with those two spare timeouts next season?,‚Äù the Sun Sentinel's Ira Winderman posted on X. ‚ÄúAre there any offseason game-management online classes available?‚Äù A major adjustment is needed by this coaching staff if the team is going play closer to its talent level next season. Despite signing a 10-year contract in 2021, Cristobal's job security is not set in stone. Just look at Jimbo Fisher. The program will have to thoroughly evaluate their current situation and determine if immediate improvement can be attained under this regime. As it stands, Miami football is already facing uncertain times at quarterback with the [transfer of Tyler Van Dyke](https://clutchpoints.com/tyler-van-dyke-predictions-transferring-wisconsin-football). Clarity is a must on the sidelines. It will be a long, long trip back from Yankee Stadium for this embattled squad.",

    "text": "[Story ProgressBack to home]()\nWomen's 1st ODI: India Suffer Crushing Six-Wicket Defeat Against Australia\nIndia Women succumbed to their sixth consecutive defeat and eighth in a row at home despite recording the highest-ever ODI total against Australia\nIndia Women succumbed to their sixth consecutive defeat and eighth in a row at home despite recording the highest-ever ODI total against Australia, as the visitors registered a commanding six-wicket win in the first match in Mumbai on Thursday.\nPhoebe Litchfield (78) and Ellyse Perry (75) anchored the chase with a resolute 148-run stand for the second wicket as Australia replied with 285/4 in 46.3 overs to overhaul India's 282/8 and take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.\nAs Phoebe and Ellyse fell in quick succession,\nBeth Mooney (42 from 47 balls, 4x4s) and Tahlia McGrath (68 not out, 55 balls, 11x4s) flattened India with their 88-run stand for the fourth wicket off only 67 balls.\nAustralia got over the line with 21 balls and six wickets to spare with none of the Indian bowlers able to make any impact.\nIndia made a perfect start by dealing an early blow to Australia, who lost\nAlyssa Healy (0) in the first over when Sneh Rana flew to her left to take an acrobatic catch off Renuka Thakur.\nBut India could not capitalise further on the initial success as Australia ran away with the game, aided by some ordinary effort in the field from the hosts.\nFor that matter, skipper\nHarmanpreet Kaur's 'golden' arm could also not come to the rescue of the side on a placid wicket as she conceded 32 runs in three overs without a wicket.\nEllyse notched up her fifth fifty against India and 33rd overall while Phoebe bounced back strongly from a poor outing in her one-off Test last week to flay the Indian attack.\nEllyse and Phoebe's 148-run association is now the third highest second-wicket partnership against India in ODIs.\nBut both the batters only had themselves to blame for their respective dismissals.\nAfter clobbering nine fours and two sixes, Ellyse danced down the track to hit one straight to\nPooja Vastrakar off Deepti Sharma (1/55) at long-on, having suffered cramps as her innings progressed.\nOn the other hand, Phoebe produced 78 runs from 89 balls with eight fours and a six in which her reverse sweep shots were the highlight.\nPhoebe fell soon after Ellyse when she missed connecting on a sweep shot off Sneh Rana in the 31st over.\nEarlier, a fine 82 from Jemimah Rodrigues and a brisk unbeaten 62 from Pooja Vastrakar propelled India Women to their highest ODI total of 282/8. India's previous-best against Australia in ODIs was 281/4 at Derby in 2017.\nWith several top-order batters failing to convert starts, Jemimah battled energy-sapping heat and humidity to carry her imperious form, notching up her second fifty in four ODIs this year, and the first against Australia.\nThe right-handed batter also recorded her second-best score in the format, laced with seven boundaries off 77 balls.\nShe also forged several partnerships, including a 68-run stand with Pooja for the eighth wicket.\nPooja displayed her big-hitting ability yet again, smashing the ball to all corners of the ground to bring up her fourth fifty.\nThe right-handed batter smacked seven fours and two sixes to remain unbeaten on 62 off just 46 balls.\nIndia's late surge saw the hosts collect 56 runs in the last six overs with Pooja carrying on after Jemimah had fallen to\nAshleigh Gardner (2/63).\nWith wickets falling steadily right from the start, opener\nYastika Bhatia continued to hold one end up to inch closer to a half-century.\nBut she could not resist a tempting full toss from leg-spinner\nGeorgia Wareham (2/55) and was caught by Megan Schutt at deep square leg. latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\nYastika, though, deserves full marks, as the makeshift opener gave a decent platform to Jemimah and Pooja to build on with her 64-ball 49.\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\n ",

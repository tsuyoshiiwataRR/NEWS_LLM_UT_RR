Sport 1 week ago Nandre Burger returned to pick up two wickets off consecutive deliveries, and from 52/2 in the 19th over, India were shot out for 131 in the 35th, a collapse of 79/8 in 16 overs.\nOnly Kohli showed the necessary skill to get on top of the SA bowlers, making 76 off 82 balls, but his composure was also absent at times, as shown in his role in the crazy run out of Jasprit Bumrah.\nThere will be plenty of questions for the Indians to answer.\nThis series, diabolically only lasting two matches, is one they now cannot win.\nSA remains the only country in which India has yet to win a Test series.\nFor South Africa this win will provide a much needed boost in morale.\nFor Dean Elgar it was a personal triumph.\n‚ÄòIt was just my day‚Äô: Rabada on his five-star Boxing Day Test day one display Proteas front-line fast bowler Kagiso ‚ÄòKG‚Äô Rabada was almost lost for words when asked to describe his masterful, clinical and almost flawless ... Sport 1 week ago Having announced his retirement from Test cricket - a decision partly down to the lack of Test match play for the Proteas in the next few years - he produced one of his best performances in making 185 and anchored the SA first innings in which they scored 408 on a difficult pitch, with overhead conditions also favouring the bowlers.\nHe ended up as captain too with Temba Bavuma not able to take the field because of a hamstring strain he picked up while fielding on the first day.\nThe team‚Äôs management, following numerous inquiries over the last few days, finally provided an update on Thursday afternoon, that stated Bavuma was still undergoing ‚Äúcontinuous medical assessments.‚Äù\nAlthough there‚Äôd been speculation about him possibly batting, that was deemed too risky.\nFortunately India‚Äôs fragility and the brilliance of SA‚Äôs bowlers meant a fourth innings run chase was eliminated.\nRabada finished with 2/32, while debutant Nandre Burger claimed 4/33 and Jansen, despite some struggles with control, took 3/36.\nThere will be concerns about the fielding, with South Africa dropping five catches in the matches, three in India‚Äôs second innings.\nBut that is a problem that can be addressed from a position of triumph.",

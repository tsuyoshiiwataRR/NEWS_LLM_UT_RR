    "text": "Tottenham returned to reality again, \"restarted\" by Brighton and reminded what kind of football they can play. The \"Seagulls\" had a crisis period, three matches without a win in the Premier League, but tonight everything in Roberto de Zerbi's team worked like clockwork for more than 80 minutes. Brighton won 4:2, they were leading 4:0, and it could be hinted that they were on their way to victory in the 11th minute when 18-year-old Jack Hilshenwood checked Guillermo Vicari. The home team's advantage was doubled in the 23rd from a penalty taken by João Pedro, and in the 63rd, the moment of the game was seen - [Eurogoal by Pervis Estupinjan, who shook the net from thirty meters](https://dubz.co/v/yk5axb). Spurs executed themselves, and Brighton once again - again through Pedro from the penalty spot - completed the poker, before the London team also showed something. Ten minutes before the end, Argentina's Alejo Velis reduced the score to 4:1 on a pass from Son, then Ben Davis scored to make it 4:2, so the fans at \"Amex\" were excited. Brighton's victory, however, was not in jeopardy. Bonus video:",

    "text": "Alpine skiing-Austria's Schwarz out for the season after downhill crash [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 05:27 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 05:27 IST Austrian overall World Cup leader Marco Schwarz's season is over after he suffered a serious knee injury in a downhill race on the challenging Stelvio slope in Bormio on Thursday. Midway through the descent in the Italian Alps the 28-year-old hit a rut and crashed into the safety nets. A helicopter was required to take him to a clinic in Innsbruck, Austria. The Austrian Ski Federation said on X that Schwarz tore his ligaments and meniscus, while also suffering cartilage damage, and \"must conclude the season prematurely.\" Frenchman Cyprien Sarrazin won the race and Switzerland's Marco Odermatt, who finished second, claimed the overall World Cup lead with 536 points following Schwarz's exit. Cameron Alexander of Canada took third place. (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

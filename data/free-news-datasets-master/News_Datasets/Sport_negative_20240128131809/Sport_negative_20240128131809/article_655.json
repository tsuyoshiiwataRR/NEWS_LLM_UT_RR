    "text": "Cardale Jones wasn’t impressed with\nMiami in its latest bowl loss to Rutgers. The former Ohio State quarterback ripped both the coaching staff and fanbase, saying he “feels bad” for recruits headed to The U.\nThe Hurricanes were beaten soundly by the Scarlet Knights on Thursday, falling 31-24 in the Bad Boy Mowers Pinstripe Bowl.\nMiami scored a late touchdown to make the score seem closer than it actually was, but for the most part, it was all\nRutgers.\nGreg Schiano’s bunch jumped out to a quick 14-0 lead before the ‘Canes bounced back with 17 straight points. Over the last 25 minutes of play, however, they’d be outscored 17-7, with that lone touchdown coming with the game in hand.\nRutgers controlled the line of scrimmage, rushing for over 200 yards against the Miami defense. They only needed seven passing completions to win the game.\nCardale Jones was tuned into that B1G-ACC matchup, providing commentary for his online following throughout.\nNever thought I’d see a day where Rutgers DOMINATES a team lol\n[#BIG10]!!!!\n— Cardale Jones (@CJ1two)\n[December 28, 2023]\nMost of that reaction was negative towards the Hurricanes.\nHe went for the kill after seeing Miami fall behind by two scores in the second half, blasting both the staff and university in a\nwarning to recruits.\n“Man, I feel bad for the recruits going to Miami for NIL,” Jones wrote. “Bad staff, no stability within program, and one of the worst college home game atmospheres. Chasing the money isn’t always the answer. But good luck.”\nJones points to the\ntypically awful environment at Hurricane home games, one that a multitude of gameday promotions couldn’t help this past season.\nHe also noted the NIL program, which has made waves with\nlucrative offers to prospective athletes over the last few years.\nMany at Miami believed they’d found the savior for a struggling program in head coach Mario Cristobal, but he’s gone just 12-12 in two seasons at the helm with\nlosses to the likes of Middle Tennesse State, Duke, and Georgia Tech.\nHis 2023 loss to the Yellow Jackets\nreceived immense criticism after he refused to kneel the ball with the game in hand, leading to a turnover and subsequent game-winning score for GT.\nMiami’s season came to a deflating end with the bowl game loss on Thursday. We’ll see if Cristobal and Co. can change Cardale Jones’s mind next year.",

    "text": "The New York Giants have been linked to selecting 2023 Heisman Trophy winner Jayden Daniels when they make their first selection in April’s NFL Draft, however, a new report claims he may not be available when they are on the clock.\nThis has been a very disappointing season for the Giants, especially on offense. Pro Bowler Saquon Barkley has had a disappointing season, the offensive line has been a mess, and injuries to their top two quarterbacks led to undrafted rookie Tommy DeVito making several starts this season.\nRelated:\nFormer New York Giants Super Bowl winner arrested for alleged string of robberies\nHowever, even before the injuries, some major concerns arose that\nDaniel Jones probably wouldn’t be the long-term answer at quarterback. Despite giving the former first-round pick a four-year contract worth $160 million earlier this year.\nThat is why some around the league and team believe they could use their first pick in the 2024 NFL Draft on one of the talented QB prospects available. The top three signal callers in this year’s class are 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams, North Carolina star Drake Maye, and 2023 Heisman winner Jayden Daniels.\nSome believe Daniels could be New York’s top target when they are likely\non the clock at five. However, a new report suggests that the LSU star could be gone before then.\nNew York Giants potential top pick Jayden Daniels may now go after Caleb Williams\nEarlier this week,\nSports Illustrated NFL insider Albert Breer spoke with executives and scouts around the league if Daniels is still the third-best QB available, which has been the shared assumption for months. However, some around the NFL believe Daniels has blown by Maye into the No. 2 spot.\n“Jayden is pulling away from Drake for me,” one AFC exec told Breer. “… He makes every throw, his deep accuracy is rare, he’s explosive as a runner but is a pocket passer. It’s like <a href=\"https://sportsnaut.com/player/deshaun-watson/\">\n[Deshaun Watson</a>].”\nRelated:\nPotential top pick for New York Giants and New York Jets in NFL Draft declares for 2024 event\nWhile there are certainly big fans of Daniels around the league, there are also some who feel Maye is still sure to go after Williams in April.\n“I think Drake has a Pro Bowl ceiling,” and AFC scout told Breer. “His floor is\nDak [Prescott}, before this MVP month] and his ceiling is [[Justin] Herbert]https://sportsnaut.com/player/justin-herbert/. I had Jayden as a quality backup with the ceiling of a system starter, more in-line with the [Jimmy [Garoppolo]]https://sportsnaut.com/player/jimmy-garoppolo/ or Kirk Cousins range. … I like him, his athleticism adds value. I just didn’t love him as a passer.”\nThe New England Patriots and Washington Commanders select before the New York Giants and are likely to take a QB.",

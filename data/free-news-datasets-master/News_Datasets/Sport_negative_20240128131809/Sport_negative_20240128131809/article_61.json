    "text": "With the Baltimore Orioles franchise in an upward swing, it seems the CEO John Angelos does not want to relinquish his control of the team despite it being his father’s wish upon his death. After five straight losing seasons, including three years with over 100 losses, the process has finally worked and the Baltimore Orioles are relevant again. They stunned the baseball world in 2022 by finally making the jump and becoming a competitive team. Then in 2023, they evolved into a full-fledged contender.

Heading into 2024, Baltimore has a team built to be good for years to come and has the cap flexibility and assets to further improve the roster. All the work that the Angelos family put into bringing the franchise back to relevancy has finally paid off. And with their branding growing it could be a perfect time to sell. It is something that has been rumored in MLB circles recently and is reportedly something that owner Peter Angelos wants to happen after he passes away. That could come soon with the 94-year-old battling health issues in recent years. However, it seems that his eldest son John — the organization’s chairman and CEO — has no interest in letting the franchise slip out of the family’s control. On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that a battle over the future of the Baltimore Orioles could be brewing inside the Angelos family. “John Angelos has indicated privately that he intends to keep the club moving forward, potentially throwing the future of the franchise into turmoil,” the Wall Street Journal claims.

With the value of owning a sports team in North America on a heavy upward swing, that number could certainly increase if Baltimore has another strong season in 2024. More must-reads:",

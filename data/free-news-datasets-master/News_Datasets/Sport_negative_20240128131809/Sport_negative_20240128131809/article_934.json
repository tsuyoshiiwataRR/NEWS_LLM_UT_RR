    "text": "The Browns were already shorthanded at wide receiver for their \"Thursday Night Football\" matchup against the Jets [with Amari Cooper out due to a heel injury](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/amari-cooper-heel-injury-update-browns/2d97ab4d995be7a75525d01c). Their depth chart got even shorter when Elijah Moore suffered a scary head injury in the second quarter. Joe Flacco had found Moore open across the middle for a 22-yard gain, but he hit his head hard on the ground once he got tackled, knocking him out of the contest. MORE: [Follow live: Browns take on Jets as Cleveland looks to clinch playoff berth on 'TNF'](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/jets-browns-live-score-highlights-thursday-night-football/363b8bf15ba889110fff9906) How serious is Moore's injury? The Sporting News has you covered with the latest updates below. Elijah Moore head injury update Moore was stepping up in Cooper's absence early on in the Browns' \"Thursday Night Football\" showdown against the Jets. Moore was having a productive game against his former team, tallying five receptions for 61 yards and a touchdown. When Flacco found him on a crossing route in the second quarter, Moore added 22 yards to his total before a regular tackle by Jets linebacker CJ Mosley caused him to hit his head hard on the ground. Moore's immediate reaction was a frightening one as the Browns' medical staff rushed to the field. ( [You can watch the play here](https://x.com/NFL_DovKleiman/status/1740562037330341938?s=20), with viewer discretion advised.) Moore, thankfully, was able to get to his feet and walk into the blue medical tent. Moments after he walked to the locker room under his own power. He has been ruled out for the remainder of the game with a concussion. Check back for updates as they become available.",

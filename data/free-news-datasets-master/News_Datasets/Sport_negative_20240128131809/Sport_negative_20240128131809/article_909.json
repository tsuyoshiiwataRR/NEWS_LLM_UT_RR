    "text": "Detroit Pistons guard Cade Cunningham.\nThings aren’t going good for the Detroit Pistons. Not good at all, in fact.\nDetroit lost a nail biter to the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night. That in itself wasn’t big news. The Pistons have been doing a lot of losing in the past decade, after all.\nWhat was news — big news — was the fact that the loss was Detroit’s 27th straight, which set an NBA record for futility.\nThey’re arguably the worst NBA team ever and with two more losses, they’ll officially hold that title. The Philadelphia 76ers lost 28 straight, but that spanned the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons. With games against the Boston Celtics and Toronto Raptors up next on the schedule, the odds would suggest that 29 straight is in the Pistons’ future, and they’ll end up doing it in one season.\nDetroit hasn’t won since its home opener back on October 28. The Pistons went winless in November and will likely be winless in December as well.\nThe Pistons are terrible. They’re are awful — historically so.\nAnd for former No. 1 overall pick Cade Cunningham, the Pistons are his team. Despite dropping 41 points in an attempt to help his franchise avoid ugly history, and even though he’s averaging 23 points, seven assists and 4.1 rebounds per game, Cunningham believes he should be the face of this ineptitude.\n“Everyday, I try to lead the squad,” Cunningham told the media after the game, per Omari Sankofa II. “I haven’t been successful with that. Two-and-28. I just felt like it’s only right that I come up and can speak for it, be the face for it. That locker room and everybody in there cares a lot. Everybody’s trying to do everything they can to win games and be successful. I put a lot of that weight on myself, for sure.”\nCunningham may be accepting responsibility for this team, but he’s far from the reason for Detroit’s struggles in 2023. He’s far from the person who deserves the blame.\nThere’s owner Tom Gores, who is seemingly aloof and can’t find the balance between meddling in his team and staying put across the country in California. There’s general manager Troy Weaver, who has constructed arguably the worst put-together roster of all time. There’s head coach Monty Williams, who Gores handed a six-year, $78.5 million contract to this offseason. Right now, he’s making $39.2 million a win.\nThe Pistons are 2-28 and may not win 10 games this season.\nCunningham would be an all-star on any other team. With this thrown together collection of centers and injured veterans, though, he’s unfortunately left taking the blame.\nWant more articles like this?

    "text": "Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant.\nSince his return from a second gun-related suspension, Ja Morant has been dazzling. After an eight-month layoff, he hasn’t missed a beat, helping lead Memphis to four straight wins and claiming Western Conference Player of the Week honors.\nAfter Morant received his 25-game ban in June, he said all the right things. He apologized to the NBA, his teammates and the kids who look up to him. He said he realized how much hurt he has caused. He made a promise to his fans that he was a changed person. He ended his initial statement with this plea: “I hope you’ll give me the chance to prove to you over time I’m a better man than what I’ve been showing you.”\nBut after a game-sealing dunk against New Orleans, Morant may have revealed that he hasn’t changed at all. Or at least that he has little remorse or regard for his actions. While there is some dispute about what he actually did during his celebration, many people think he was simulating firing guns into the crowd.\nPrior to Morant, the most high-profile incident with guns in the NBA involved Gilbert Arenas. In December of 2009, after a dispute concerning about $1,000, Arenas and teammate Javaris Crittenton got into a showdown in the locker room. While the NBA investigated, Arenas seemed to seal his own fate by pointing finger guns during the home introduction in a game shortly afterwards. He was ultimately suspended 50 games.\nWhen originally asked about Morant’s 25-game suspension, Arenas believed it was too harsh. “It’s public perception,” he said. “The public wants him to be stopped. So, now the NBA comes in and says, ‘All right, we have to make it look reasonable.’”\nBut, after Morant’s own gun gestures, what does Arenas think now? He posted the clip below to his X page in response. And although it has no commentary, it seems to imply that Morant needs to be smarter about how he handles himself.\nTime will tell if Morant gets it and truly wants to be a better man. But if he doesn’t learn from his mistakes – and from those of others – his career in the NBA could end up being painfully short.\nWant more articles like this?

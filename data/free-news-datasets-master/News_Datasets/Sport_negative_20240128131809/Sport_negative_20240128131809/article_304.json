    "text": "Nathan Collins was one of the main figures in Brentford's Premier League clash with Wolves yesterday, and not in a good way. The centre back had one of, if not the worst game of his career in the 1-4 loss, with two intercepted passes leading directly to two goals, while he was also partly at fault for Wolves other two goals, and blasted a close range header over the bar. Thomas Frank Comforts Nathan Collins After Brentford Disaster Class Collins' time at Brentford has been largely positive so far, and such was the disaster of the performance, manager Thomas Frankel could only smile when comforting Collins. I told him it will never be as bad as this, it is impossible â€” with a smile on my face: ironic. He's been a very positive player for us. When he got injured, he was on a really good run of form, so it happens. Today it will be tough and tonight he will be down. One thing is for sure: it is a fact that the sun will rise again, a new day. I expect him to walk in tomorrow with head high and go again. You can't sit in the corner and feel sorry for yourself because then you're lost. He's not that kind of character. He will be fine. It will be tough, he will never forget it! But he will come through.

    "text": "- The Denver Broncos are benching\nRussell Wilsonfor the remainder of the season, the team announced.\n- Several outlets report that the franchise plans to cut the\nstar quarterbackafter the season ends.\n- The rumor has prompted questions about head coach\nSean Payton's relationship with the star QB.\nRussell Wilson's time in Denver appears to be reaching its end.\nBroncos head coach Sean Payton announced Wednesday that his team would proceed with former back-up quarterback Jarrett Stidham starting under center, leaving Wilson to watch the final two games of the season from the bench.\nAnd now, reports from several outlets suggest that Denver will waive the\nsuperstar quarterback during the offseason — a move that's come as a shock to many given Wilson's impressive career accolades, including a Super Bowl win with his former team, and solid play over his last few games with the Broncos.\nEven some of Denver's players felt blindsided, with star\nwide receiver Jerry Jeudy telling members of the press that Payton's decision to bench Wilson \"was a surprise to everybody in our locker room.\"\n\"He just told us out of nowhere,\" Jeudy said of Payton, per DenverSports.com's Andrew Mason. \"So I was pretty surprised, having Russ as our starting quarterback the whole year, then the last two games there being a switch.\"\nPayton's relationship with Wilson\nFormer\nNFL quarterback Robert Griffin III seemed somewhat unsurprised by Payton's moves, and rumored plans. He noted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that \"Wilson's biggest opposition this year was Sean Payton\" and expounded upon that thought on his podcast.\n\"For Sean Payton to do everything that he's done to Russell Wilson when he came in the door, he was trying to make it seem like he was not the problem,\" Griffin\nsaid on the \"RG3 and the Ones\" podcast. \"When you pay a quarterback who has won a Super Bowl and is a Hall of Famer, when you treat him the way Sean Payton has, it just feels to me like he doesn't want him to be his quarterback.\"\nA group of ex-NFL-players-turned-analysts also voiced concerns that Payton's relationship with Wilson seemed fraught from the beginning.\nFormer cornerback Bucky Brooks\nposted on X that Wilson's tense interactions with Payton \"always seemed far more personal than a normal HC/QB1 debate.\" Emmanuel Acho, who played linebacker for several NFL franchises, wrote that \"the Broncos have to stop disrespecting Russ.\"\nCraig Carton, a sports radio and TV personality who hosts \"The Carton Show\" on FS1, subscribed to the same logic. He said Thursday morning that Payton \"disliked Russell Wilson on a level I've never seen before.\"\n\"Whether you like Russell Wilson or not, Russell Wilson's a pro,\" Carton said. \"Russell Wilson's an accomplished veteran in this league and has never done anybody wrong that we're aware of publicly. For Sean Payton to humiliate him in this manner is wrong.\"\nA representative from the franchise responded to Business Insider's request for comment by referencing Payton's press conference from Wednesday. The head coach confirmed that the quarterback change was his decision and was motivated by the team's offensive struggles.\n\"I understand all the speculation and everything that surrounds a move like that,\" Payton told reporters. \"I can tell you we're desperately trying to win.\"\nDenver may save $37 million by keeping Wilson on the bench\nNow that they've chosen to build around a new quarterback, the Broncos are likely looking to\nsave themselves some of the money they initially promised Wilson. Just after he joined the franchise in 2022, the nine-time Pro Bowler signed a signed a gargantuan $242,588,236 contract to spend five years in the Mile High City and become one of the highest-paid players in the NFL, per Spotrac.\nNo matter what, Denver owes Wilson a whopping $39 million next season, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. But if the Broncos part ways with Wilson during the offseason, they'll avoid paying him another $37 million he'd be due for the following year.\nThe only way that $37 million would otherwise become guaranteed is if Wilson were to sustain an injury in the course of play. Should the quarterback do so and remain hurt by the beginning of next season, Denver would be unable to cut him and would be contractually obligated to pay out the considerable sum.\nIn other words, the decision to keep Wilson off the field for the rest of the 2023-2024 campaign \"assures that money won't trigger,\" Schefter\nexplained on X. And Bleacher Report reported that the Broncos allegedly pressured Wilson into waiving the injury clause, but that Wilson refused.\nWhile he says he understands \"the economics\" associated with benching Wilson, Payton insists that the decision was not financially motivated. If it were, as he questioned hypothetically during Wednesday's press conference, \"then why not last week or two weeks ago or three weeks ago or four weeks ago?\"\n\"Sure, in our game today there are economics and all those other things,\" Payton said. \"But the No. 1 push behind this — and it's a decision I'm making — is to get a spark offensively.\"\nBusiness Insider",

Not Garrick Morgan.\nWhen it comes to his ill-fated defection from the Wallabies to rugby league in 1995, Morgan’s fairly upfront: “I wish I had stayed in union, with what ended up happening.”\nMorgan’s short but headline-grabbing season in rugby league resurfaced recently when Wallabies winger Mark Nawaqanitawase made the decision to switch to the NRL in 2025, with a two-year contract at the Roosters.\nHaving started in every game at the Rugby World Cup, Nawaqanitawase became the first incumbent Wallaby to switch codes since Morgan made the same call in 1994, signing for the South Queensland Crushers on a three-year deal.\nMorgan was rated as one of the world’s best rugby forwards, but the dominance didn’t transfer to league. Carrying a neck injury, Morgan only played two first-grade games for the Crushers and by the end of 1995, he’d returned to rugby.\nGarrick Morgan holding the Bledisloe Cup in 1997.\nBut because the switch was so hyped – due to the size of his profile and pay cheque – Morgan’s fizzled season earned him a place in sporting folklore anyway. His season with the Crushers still pops up whenever lists of unsuccessful code switches are produced.\n“It was an interesting time,” he recalls. “That year I did go, I got a pretty full-on injury, a neck injury, where I lost all my strength.\n“And the pressure was on me to perform straight away. In hindsight, it would have been better to have a year of developing into that position. And I thought I was more of a second row, than a prop, by the end of it.”\nAdvertisement Where Nawaqanitawase agonised for weeks over his decision to chase a new challenge, Morgan says his was more a snap decision, made after he was overlooked for a Wallabies Test against Italy in Melbourne in 1994.\nGarrick Morgan playing for the Wallabies and the Crushers (centre) Credit: Getty, Channel Nine\nIt was a big call. A hulking forward at 198cm and 130kg, Morgan had been named the best player in the world at the end of 1993 by influential French outlet Midi Olympique , and he was giving up a spot at the 1995 Rugby World Cup, where Australia would go in as defending champions.\n“I got myself a manager, and he was quite connected to the Crushers,” Morgan said. “At the end of the day I had a bit of an injury when I was playing for the Wallabies and I could have played the next game. It was a Test against Italy in Melbourne and they opted to rest me, which I didn’t think I should have been.\n“I thought I had worked hard for my Test jersey and they were resting me and playing someone else, so I was a bit bewildered. I made the decision that night, after that Test match, that I was going to go to league. I had worked so hard to get that jersey and it kind of felt like, ‘Is that how quick it can go away?’ ”\nThe size of the Crushers’ offer helped, no doubt, and Morgan signed on as one of the best-paid players on the new club’s roster, with a three-year, $600,000 deal. It was – just – before the ARL-Super League contract wars broke out, and was viewed as big bucks for an untried code-hopper.\nRugby was still amateur and with union players exempt from the ARL salary cap in their first year (sound familiar?), a dozen players made the switch in the 1995 expansion year, including John Kirwan (Auckland), John Timu (Bulldogs), Anthony Herbert (Crushers), Darren Junee (Roosters) and Peter Jorgensen (Roosters).\nOther Wallabies were also targets: Tim Horan had verbally agreed with Bob Saunders to go to North Sydney before injuring his knee in 1994 and Jason Little backed out of a deal with the Crushers at the 11th hour.\n“It was weird, at the time we would joke with guys like Timmy Horan and Jason, ‘If you go, I’ll go’ sort of thing,” Morgan says.\nSir John Kirwan in action for the Auckland Warriors against Cronulla after switching codes in 1995. Credit: Fairfax\n“I remember seeing when I went to the Crushers they had Jason’s bag and gear all there laid out to collect. But he didn’t come, in the end.”\nMorgan signed off from the Wallabies in the George Gregan tackle game at the SFS and joined the Crushers.\nHe had played league as a teenager and his father John “Pogo” Morgan played for Australia, NSW and Manly in the 13-man code in the 1960s, but junior’s size didn’t make for an easy transfer.\n“It was a different type of training,” Morgan says. “You had to be pretty fit. They were interested in seeing what I could do at that weight [128kg], but it is not a good weight to be playing unless you have the bench like they do today, and you can have a big rest.\n“It was tough. I couldn’t tackle properly because of that neck injury. I went in at 130kg and came out at about 114kg, and felt a lot better for that.”\nMorgan played in first grade against Penrith and Canberra, but missing the power and natural league instincts, he was otherwise left in reserve grade. By the middle of the year, he realised rugby was home and explored a return, with the Crushers’ blessing. The Super League war was by then exploding and in October, World Rugby also ended the 15-man game’s amateur status.\n“I was so lucky they’d turned professional, and so the option was there,” Morgan says.\n“With the Crushers, the injury had got better by the end of the first year, but all that Super League war was happening and it wasn’t a nice place to be in, at the time. It wasn’t much fun.\n“I met some great blokes and some great people, don’t get me wrong. But in the gyms, people were all talking about money and things. I was thinking ‘God, what’s going on?’.”\nMorgan was back playing for Queensland and the Wallabies in 1996, and went on to earn another eight caps. He moved overseas in 1998 to play in England and France, before retiring in 2006 and became a top club coach in Queensland. He is now director of rugby at Souths in Brisbane.\nLoading In the sliding doors version, could an injury-free Morgan have become a good rugby league player?\n“You say that to yourself, but yeah, I believe I could have,” Morgan says.\n“I look at my other mates who went and played league, and it took them three or four years before they were flying.\n“Knowing what I know, I say I wish I had not left rugby, but I also wish my stay in league could have been better and I could have not had an injury and made a better go of it.”\nSports news, results and expert commentary.

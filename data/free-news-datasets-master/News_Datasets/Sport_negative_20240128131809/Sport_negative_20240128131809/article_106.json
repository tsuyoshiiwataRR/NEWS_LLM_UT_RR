    "text": "[by Derek Major](https://www.blackenterprise.com/author/majord/) December 28, 2023 Memphis Grizzlies Guard JA Morant Responds To Criticism For Celebration In Win Over New Orleans Pelicans He was literally dancing. :-/ Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant responded to the heavy scrutiny he faced following a celebration after a big dunk during Tuesday night’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans. Sports Illustrated [reported ](https://www.si.com/nba/2023/12/27/grizzlies-ja-morant-celebration-criticism-responds-reaction-rock-ya-hips?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=news_tab&fs=e&s=cl)after the win, Morant celebrated by dancing toward the crowd. However, many people on social media believed he was miming shooting fake guns. The celebration comes just four games after Morant served a 25-game suspension stemming from the Grizzlies guard showing guns on Instagram Live twice. Morant responded to the criticisms on the X app, formerly known as Twitter, indicating that he was dancing and not firing weapons. The Grizzlies struggled without Morant during his 25-game suspension, starting the season 6-19. However, since Morant’s return, the Grizzlies have won four straight games, and the point guard has led the team in points for two of the wins and assists in all four. The Murray State [product](https://www.blackenterprise.com/tag/ja-morant/) was named the Western Conference [player of the week](https://www.nba.com/grizzlies/news/grizzlies-ja-morant-named-nba-western-conference-player-of-the-week-122623) following his return. Morant has averaged 28.8 points, 8.5 assists, and 5.3 rebounds while shooting 50.6% from the field in the four games he’s played in. Morant, named the 2019-20 Rookie of the Year, has enjoyed a fantastic start to his career. The two-time All-Star won the 2021-22 Most Improved Player award and was named to the All-NBA second team. However, the All-Star guard was suspended in June after he was seen on Instagram Live flashing a gun. It was the second time he was caught on social media with a firearm in his hand. The 23-year-old was first suspended for eight games in March after he was shown with a gun on an Instagram Live video at a Denver nightclub. The Grizzlies are currently 10-19 and in 13th place in the Western Conference. As bad as their start was, they’re just five games out of a playoff spot with more than a month to go before the regular season’s halfway point. The Grizzlies start a two-game road trip Thursday against the Denver Nuggets and the L.A. Clippers before heading home to host the Sacramento Kings and San Antonio Spurs.",

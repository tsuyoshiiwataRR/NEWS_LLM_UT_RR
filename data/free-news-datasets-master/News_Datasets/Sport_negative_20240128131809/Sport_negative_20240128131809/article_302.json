    "text": "Ange Postecoglou is speaking to the media following Tottenham's 4-2 defeat at Brighton on Thursday night in the Premier League. The Spurs boss made two changes to his team from the one that overcame Everton at the weekend, with Oliver Skipp out with a knock but set to be back for Sunday's match against Bournemouth to see out 2023. Postecoglou had nine first team players unavailable for the trip to the Amex Stadium and that meant a bench mostly full of youngsters. Tottenham were looking to get back into the top four after Manchester City took their place with their win against Everton in midweek. Brighton took the lead though within 12 minutes against Spurs' makeshift backline. It was all too easy for Joao Pedro to dribble across the edge of the Spurs box past a few challenges and he knocked the ball to Jack Hinshelwood to lash home a powerful strike. The hosts doubled their lead after referee Jarred Gillett was advised to go to his pitchside monitor after Dejan Kulusevski grabbed Danny Welbeck by the shirt and hauled him back as he was trying to shoot. The penalty was given and dispatched by Joao Pedro. Spurs began probing for a goal back in the second half but were hit by Brighton's third, a dipping strike from distance from Pervis Estupinan which nestled in the far corner. Then the home side added a fourth after a lunging tackle by Giovani Lo Celso on Evan Ferguson resulted in a penalty which Pedro again scored. Tottenham did get a goal back as Alejo Veliz scored his first goal for the club. Son Heung-min picked him out after a Kulusevski tackle and the young Argentine bounced home a shot. Then Ben Davies added another, heading in Pedro Porro's cross. Despite Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hitting the post late on, Tottenham could not find a way back. Our Spurs correspondent Alasdair Gold is among those putting the questions to Postecoglou after the match. Scroll down for his latest updates from the press conference at the Amex Stadium. Here's every word Postecoglou said Here's every word the Tottenham boss said in his press conference in a full transcript which you can find [right here](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/news/every-word-postecoglou-said-brighton-28361320) or scroll down for some highlights. The Spurs boss on the first penalty It was obviously clear and obvious because it only took him three minutes to see it on the screen and VAR picked up everything today except the one tackle which nearly cost me another player. So that's their decisions. More from Postecoglou It's difficult. It's been difficult this whole run. We've been stretched for a very long time and we've just tried to play on through it. That's what we've done and we're only in the position we are because of the enormous efforts of the players to do jobs that normally is not in their brief but they do it willingly and they give everything. For me that's all I can ask for. The players have given everything they've got and it's a credit to them. Today we fell short but not for the want of trying. Postecoglou is here Look, fair to say we were looking a bit tired and lacked our usual sharpness, especially at the start of the game. We've been starting games well. I guess that's understandable, we've been on this run for a whole now and asking players to perform at levels... It's very demanding the way we play physically and today we kind of looked like a team that wasn't at its sharpest. Brighton are a good side and they took advantage of that. Ultimately what I do know is the players everything they had they gave and that's all I can ask for.",

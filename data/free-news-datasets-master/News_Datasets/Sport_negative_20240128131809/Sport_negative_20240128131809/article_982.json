    "text": "Hoping to avoid a 28th straight loss that would match the longest losing streak in NBA history, the Detroit Pistons forced overtime against the league-best Celtics before Boston recovered to win 128-122.\nDespite making it to overtime for the first time in the skid, Detroit matched the 2016 Philadelphia 76ers with 28 consecutive losses.\nThe Pistons need a victory at home against Toronto on Saturday night to avoid breaking the record.\nDetroit opened a season-high 21-point lead in the first half only to trail 106-100 in the final two minutes of regulation.\nJaden Ivey scored six straight points to erase the deficit, then Bojan Bogdanovic made a putback with 4.6 seconds left to send it to OT.\nBut Derrick White scored 10 of his 23 points in the extra period and Kristaps Porzingis had six in the overtime - dunking after a full-court pass from Jayson Tatum and then sinking a pair of free throws to make it 125-117.\nPorzingis had 35 points - 11 in the fourth quarter, and eight of those during a 10-0 run that turned a four-point deficit lead into a 106-100 lead.\nTatum had 31 points 10 assists for Boston, who registered a fourth-straight win and a ninth in their last 10 games.\nCade Cunningham again led Detroit, with 31 points and nine assists, Ivey had 22 points and 10 rebounds and Jalen Duren had 15 points and 14 rebounds.\nThe Pistons set the NBA record for most consecutive losses in a single season on Tuesday night with their 27th in a row - a 118-112 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.\nThe Sixersâ€™ streak stretched over two seasons, 2014-15 and 2015-16.",

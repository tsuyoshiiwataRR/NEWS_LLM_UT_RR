    "text": "Gilbert Arenas Spearheads Campaign For Unfortunate Superstar as Detroit Pistons Sink Deeper The streak…isn’t over. In one of the most puzzling developments of the NBA season, the Detroit Pistons continue to be the worst team in the league. Perhaps, in league history. After breaking the streak for most consecutive losses, each loss continues to compound their situation. But, during the discourse, the one common thread has been the excellent play of Cade Cunningham. Despite the team continuing to amount losses, Cunningham has been their lone bright spot. As a result, calls to “Free” Cade are already making the rounds. America’s Favorite Video Today The biggest perpetrator of the movement remains Gilbert Arenas. While other veterans, like Chandler Parsons, call for a change in the entire organization’s structure, Arenas’ focus is on one player. “#FreeCade ” was the easiest way to make his feelings on the matter clear. And, after their latest loss courtesy of the Boston Celtics, it isn’t hard to imagine why. — Gilbert Arenas (@GilsArenaShow) [December 29, 2023] ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad For one half, all was right in the Motor City. Against the best team in the league, featuring a bonafide MVP candidate in Jayson Tatum, a 19-point Pistons lead signaled a changing of the guard. But then, the second half rolled around. Falling apart at the seams, Detroit gave up a lead as high as 21, eventually losing in Overtime 128-122. Whether it was hilarious goofs by Killian Hayes, continued poor shooting, or lackluster defense, the team just wasn’t good enough. Except, for Cade of course. The former number-one overall pick would lead his team in both points and assists, doing his level best. After 2 forty-point performances in the last week, it’s been clear that he has been willing to put in the work. But, the auxiliary pieces just aren’t racking up.

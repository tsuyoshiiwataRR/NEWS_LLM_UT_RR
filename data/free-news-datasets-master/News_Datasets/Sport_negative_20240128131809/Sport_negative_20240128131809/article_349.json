    "text": "Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase didn’t hold back when asked about the Kansas City Chiefs this week.\nAsked about one of his team’s biggest rivals over the last few years, Chase provided some eyebrow-raising answers, especially when it comes to what might stand out to him about the Chiefs defense.\n“If I’m being honest, nothing,” Chase said, as captured by CLNS Media’s Mike Petraglia . “They just know how to play us. They know the leverages; they know what splits we gonna be in. They throw a little double-doubles at us to stop the two best players on the outside. That’s all they do. It’s not like they got a Jalen Ramsey on they squad.”\nRaw, real and unfiltered, Chase has never really shied away from comments that might come across as controversial — when he’s not outright messing around through the media.\nCase in point, Chase followed up with this when asked if he’s worried about how the Chiefs might set the stage: “They can take it how they want. That’s why they double everybody because they can’t do it one-on-one.”\nThat’s certainly one way to set the stage for a showdown with a rival, as Chase’s comments will undoubtedly go down as bulletin board material around the Chiefs.\nMore Latest News Willie Anderson named Hall of Fame finalist for third straight time Orlando Brown Jr. missed son's birth for game vs. Steelers NFL Week 17 best bets: One wager to make for every team",

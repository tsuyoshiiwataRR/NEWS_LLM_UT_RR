    "text": "Northwestern’s slew of staff changes has found its way off the field. The ‘Cats are moving on from director of football performance Jay Hooten, Matt Fortuna reported Thursday afternoon. Sources: Northwestern has parted ways with OC Mike Bajakian, special teams coordinator/TEs coach Jeff Genyk and director of sports performance for football Jay Hooten. — Matt Fortuna (@Matt_Fortuna) [December 28, 2023] Hooten had been with the Wildcats since 2009 before being elevated to director of football performance in 2011, where he oversaw NU’s strength, speed and conditioning training. His release is the third move made by David Braun since the conclusion of Northwestern’s season, as NU parted ways with offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian and special teams coordinator/tight ends coach Jeff Genyk as well. This past summer, Hooten was named in lawsuit filed by former player Lloyd Yates. In the complaint, which was filed in late July, Yates alleged that Hooten informed the team that Yates had “ratted them out” for partying before a workout, and Yates was subsequently “ran” by his teammates after the workout. Before arriving to Evanston, Hooten spent six years at Ohio State, serving as an assistant for the Buckeyes strength and conditioning program during their 2002 BCS National Championship season. An Ohio native, Hooten played high school football with current NU safeties coach Matt MacPherson.

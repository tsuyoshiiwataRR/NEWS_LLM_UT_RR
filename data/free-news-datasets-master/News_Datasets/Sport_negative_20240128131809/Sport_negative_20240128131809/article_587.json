    "text": "Welterweight Colby Covington flunked big on his title contention at UFC 296. Going up against the reigning titleholder Leon Edwards, the 17-4 ‘Chaos’ lost in way of a unanimous decision. However, the fighter later contended the notion, attesting on having\nwon the 3rd, 4th, and 5th rounds against ‘Rocky.’ Now, reeling from the aftermath the fighter has let loose his political aspirations. Fans have consequently called him out on not keeping his promises.\nThis marks the fighter’s 3rd title fight loss in the division, despite talking a big game. Going up against former champion and pound-for-pound king\nKamaru Usman, Covington had lost twice. These title skids came at UFC 245 and UFC 268. The fighter has been doing social media rounds explaining his crack-ups. Speaking to Patrick Bet-David (and co-hosts Adam Sosnick and Vincent Oshana) for the PBD Podcast episode 343, he said:\nI do believe I’m the Donald Trump of the UFC...He’s my biggest role model, he’s my mentor, and he’s someone that I really look up to, so I try and model my career after a lot of things that he’s done...I definitely would like to run for Congress in a few years, I think I’d be the perfect fighter. I’m not a guy that’s going to sell out to the establishment. I’m a self-made man from nothing...Colby Covington on Patrick Bet-David’s podcast\nCovington nudged in on following in the footsteps of his close acquaintance and idol, Republic Party Nominee Donald Trump. The 45th Ex-President was in attendance at the UFC 296 headliner. However, his\nabandoning Covington’s ‘MAGA’ speech for selectively including him after an embarrassing defeat had garnered many reactions.\nA prime reaction to his political striving led to a fan saying “Nah WWE is calling“. This is a running gag alluding to his WWE-esque pretense of putting on a show, despite the output. Even the feuding Sean Strickland had recently called him a “WWE Actor“.\n“Get into Congress, maybe Senate,” Colby Covington aims to follow Donald Trump into Politics after MMA retirement\nFans react to Colby Covington’s schemes for political endeavors\nDespite a recent loss, Colby “Chaos” Covington cannot help but be chaotic, true to his moniker. Now he has riled up fans with political purports in mind. Recently he let loose his aspirations to run for Congress or the Governor of Florida. This was during a segment with the PBD podcast, where he attributed his loss to a\nrecent foot break injury.\nThe loss in question was to Leon Edwards at UFC 296. In the build-up to the title bout, Covington had ravaged the reputation of Edwards’ deceased father, to hype up the fight. Conversely, he later hinted at “playing a part”; a stint not unlike him. Check out how fans have now responded to him playing the part of a politician, in the below tweets.\nA handful of fans have alluded to close friend Donald Trump walking out early on his performance at the last headliner. Even those who have not been overtly critical of the fighter have veered off his political designs.\nIn case you missed it:\nAfter devastating loss to Leon Edwards, Colby Covington claims ‘trainwreck’ Sean Strickland is ‘easy fight’ “It absolutely works,” UFC star Colby Covington DOUBLES DOWN on his trash talking game to Tucker Carlson despite recent controversy Gerard Crispin",

    "text": "Arsenal lost against West Ham United tonight to derail their title push a bit and John Terry was baffled by one thing he saw on the night. The Gunners couldn’t find a way past the Hammers despite having more than 25 shots and in the end, [David Moyes’s](https://tbrfootball.com/tag/david-moyes/) side were good value for their win. Arsenal now sit behind [Liverpool ](https://tbrfootball.com/tag/liverpool/)in the title race and the Gunners know they are once again in danger of throwing away a huge opportunity. [Manchester City](https://tbrfootball.com/tag/manchester-city/), too, are now closing in and have an all important game in hand. Of course, West Ham’s killer second goal came from a header by former defender [Konstantinos Mavropanos. ](https://tbrfootball.com/tag/konstantinos-mavropanos/)The big defender rose highest to nod in off the woodwork after being left unchallenged. And watching on, [John Terry](https://tbrfootball.com/tag/john-terry/) couldn’t believe he was seeing [Oleksandr Zinchenko](https://tbrfootball.com/tag/oleksandr-zinchenko/) and other smaller Arsenal players being left to mark the big Greek. [Taking to X on social media](https://twitter.com/JohnTerry26/status/1740487120500961684), Terry was baffled by what Arsenal were doing. MORE ARSENAL STORIES Arsenal need to find another way to win It’s all well and good playing free-flowing attacking football when teams open up a bit. But tonight, West Ham got a lead and simply never looked like letting Arsenal in. Yes, they had shots on goal but there was only really the Gabriel Jesus header where you’d say it should have been a goal. The Gunners and Mikel Arteta have got to find a way to get goals against teams who do this and ultimately, grind results out. Over the course of the season, they’ll have more times like this and they have got to find a way. They did it at Luton but against more seasoned PL sides, it’s harder. West Ham, then, might have shown a blueprint tonight for other sides to beat the Gunners.",

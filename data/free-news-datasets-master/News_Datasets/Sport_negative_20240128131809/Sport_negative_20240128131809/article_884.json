    "text": "The situation surrounding\nZach Werenski‘s Injury is getting worse, as the longtime Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman is likely going to be out week to week, according to Blue Jackets Beat Writer Brian Hedger.\nZach Werenski Out Week to Week\nPascal Vincent said Zach Werenski is still being diagnosed for the leg/lower body injury that knocked him out of last night’s game in New Jersey in the 2nd period.\nHe said it’s not a day-to-day situation. Looking more like week-to-week.\n[#CBJ]\n— Brian Hedger (@BrianHedger)\n[December 28, 2023]\nWerenski left last night’s game with a lower-body injury after getting tangled up with\nNew Jersey Devils forward Ondrej Palat, and landing awkwardly on his left leg. He missed time last year after sustaining a torn labrum in his shoulder that required surgery.\nWerenski is the Blue Jackets points leader so far this season, with 1 goal and 24 assists for 25 points in 34 games.\nPascal Vincent said he was unsure of Werenski’s timeline, and that he was still meeting with team doctors.\nWerenski has been with the Blue Jackets since being drafted in 2015 and has only had one full 82-game season with the team, which was the 2018-2019 season, where the Blue Jackets went to the second round for the first time in franchise history.\nWhat This Means\nThis is a tough loss for the Blue Jackets. Werenski has been one of the main guys on the blue line for Columbus all year.\nWerenski is one of many players who Columbus has lost long-term to injury this season, which includes\nNick Blankenburg, Jack Roslovic, Patrik Laine, Boone Jenner, and Adam Boqvist. They were top 5 in man games lost last year as well, sitting only behind Montreal and Toronto. Andrew Peeke, who was a healthy scratch in their last game against the New Jersey Devils, is said to slot in the lineup to replace Werenski, slotting in the second pairing with Ivan Provorov, according to Daily Faceoff.\nThe Blue Jackets are Eighth in the Metropolitan division with an 11-18-7 record and are in the middle of a rebuild with first-year head coach Pascal Vincent.\nMAIN PHOTO: © Russell LaBounty-USA TODAY Sports",

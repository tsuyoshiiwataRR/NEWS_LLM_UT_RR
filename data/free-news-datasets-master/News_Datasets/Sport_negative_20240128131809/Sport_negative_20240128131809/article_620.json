    "text": "“He Wanted to Assault Someone”: Udonis Haslem Throws Shaquille O’Neal Under the Bus After Dropping ‘Awkward’ Confession NBA players and teams tend to have a charged up atmosphere. Due to the spirit of the competition and pressure to win, tensions are usually running high. Especially, for an organization as intense as the Miami Heat with their Heat Culture. But, in some cases, those emotions reached a boiling point with your teammates itself. That is how Shaquille O’Neal found himself ready to fight someone in the shower. America’s Favorite Video Today However, to his surprise, the team’s enforcer and voice of reason Udonis Haslem was unwilling to step in.

I ain’t going to let you fight this rookie. But, if y’all start fighting, I ain’t about to break this s**t up man. He in this motherf***er b*tt-a** n**ed.'” Then, Mr. Heat Culture as he fashions himself would give an explanation as to why he was hesitant to join and/or stop the fight. “This man was in the shower. Like, he was that mad that he wanted to assault somebody in the shower.” Despite taking on the role of team leader, Haslem wasn’t about to join the frankly ‘awkward’ situation. “But, I’m the connector and our protector. But, that’s just an awkward time to connect or anybody. So now, I ain’t want no parts of that.” However, despite this scenario, the Los Angeles Lakers legend does hold Haslem in the highest of regards. This is a developing story.

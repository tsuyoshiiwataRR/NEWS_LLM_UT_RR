    "text": "Court Summons Ignored Amid Police Raids:\nTampa Bay Rays’ shortstop, Wander Franco, seemingly defied a court summons in the Dominican Republic tied to allegations regarding inappropriate relations with a minor.\nOrdered to appear at 11:00 am on Thursday, Franco was notably absent, coinciding with police raids conducted at two of his properties in the D.R.\nPolice Raids on Franco’s Properties:\nDominican police executed raids at Franco’s family residence in Palo Blanco and another property in the Villa Real area, reportedly in search of the baseball star.\nThe investigation, concurrent with Major League Baseball’s inquiry, has led to Franco being placed on administrative leave without pay by the Rays.\nOngoing Investigations and Denials:\nThe 22-year-old athlete, under investigation since social media allegations surfaced in August, has denied the accusations.\nFranco vehemently refuted the claims in a live Instagram session and has always kept his wife, Rachelly Paulino, out of the public eye, although their relationship was previously revealed by DailyMail.com.\nLegal and Contractual Implications:\nMLB placed Franco on administrative leave in August, ensuring continued pay and service accrual while investigations persist.\nDespite the ongoing offseason, the Rays have distanced themselves by removing Franco from team-related advertisements at the Tropicana Field stadium.\nSupport and Outreach Amidst Controversy:\nAmidst the controversy, Baseball Hall of Famer David Ortiz expressed attempts to reach out and support Franco.\nOrtiz shared his interaction with Franco during the All-Star Game festivities, emphasizing the role of veterans in guiding and mentoring young players within the sport.\nRead More On The Topic On TDPel Media []https://pelmedic.com",

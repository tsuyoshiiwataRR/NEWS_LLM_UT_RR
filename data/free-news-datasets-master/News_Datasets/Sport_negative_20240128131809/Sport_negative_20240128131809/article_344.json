    "text": "Brock Purdy doesn’t expect to be held down long. The San Francisco 49ers quarterback is on the heels of a dismal performance against the Baltimore Ravens. Purdy also sustained an injury during the game to make matters somewhat worse. But based on how he’s talking, it doesn’t seem like he’ll be out for an extended period.\nPurdy commented on his recovery process ahead of San Francisco’s matchup with the Washington Commanders. Purdy and the Niners hope to finish the season strong and rebound off that loss Monday night.\nWhen it comes to his status, Purdy didn’t sound worried.\n“No, it’s been good. Just got a lot of treatment done on it and everything,” the 49ers quarterback said of his shoulder stinger. “Sort of just work out the soreness within the whole shoulder area, trap area. But it feels good, so I’ll be good for this game.”\nThere you have it.\nPurdy has put together an impressive season for a guy picked last in the NFL Draft. He’s held up strong despite a myriad of critics. He’s had MVP talk this year, even while Christian McCaffrey may seem like the better choice. That’s what being a quarterback will get you.\nNeedless to say, the 49ers will need Purdy and the Niners to be at their best going forward. The playoff push approaches, so we’ll see how everything shakes out.",

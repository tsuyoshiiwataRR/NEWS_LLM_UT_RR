    "text": "Bad news for Man Utd and Real Madrid! Benfica confirm they will not let top targets Joao Neves and Antonio Silva leave in January window Posted Friday, December 29, 2023 by Goal.com Manchester United and Real Madrid have been dealt transfer blows after Benfica confirmed they will not be selling two wonderkids in January. - United and Madrid suffer transfer blow - Targets Neves and Silva not for sale - Benfica boss rules out January departures WHAT HAPPENED? United have been linked with 19-year-old midfielder Joao Neves, who reportedly has a €100 million (£87m/$110m) release clause in his contract. Real Madrid are believed to have their eye on defender Antonio Silva, 20, but Benfica boss Roger Schmidt has now said that none of his players will be leaving the club in January. WHAT ROGER SCHMIDT SAID Schmidt told reporters on Thursday: \"We are halfway through the season and we have big goals. We certainly won't let any of these players leave. We need them and no one wants to leave, so there's no question.\" THE BIGGER PICTURE United are expected to be active in the January transfer window following the completion of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's minority investment in the club. Real Madrid are keen to bring in a defender after David Alaba recently joined Eder Militao on the sidelines with an ACL injury. WHAT NEXT FOR NEVES AND SILVA? It looks like Neves and Silva will stay in Lisbon to help Benfica's push for the league title and Europa League glory. However, if United and Real Madrid come calling in the summer, it's hard to see Benfica turning down a big pay day.

    "text": "Thierry Henry was not impressed by Jermain Defoe's prediction for the Premier League top four. The Arsenal legend made up one third of an elite striking trio of yesteryear during Amazon Prime's coverage of the Gunners' clash with West Ham on Thursday night. The France Under 21s boss joined Defoe and Alan Shearer for punditry duties as the former Tottenham star made his prediction for which teams would achieve Champions League qualification. 'City, Liverpool , Tottenham, Arsenal,' Defoe calmly replied to host Gabby Logan 's question, at which Henry responded in amazement. 'What?!' He said. 'What did you say? Tottenham?' But Defoe was unfazed. 'Why not?' he replied. ðŸ˜‚ @IAmJermainDefoe predicts this season's Premier League top four...\nThierry Henry does NOT agree! #PLonPrime pic.twitter.com/UgTfPtA0f3 Thierry Henry (middle right) alongside Alan Shearer (far left), Jermain Defoe (middle left) and host Gabby Logan (far right) for Amazon Prime's coverage of Arsenal v West Ham Your browser does not support iframes. Tottenham's top-four hopes were dealt a blow after a humbling 4-2 defeat by Brighton Henry's retort was justified after Ange Postecoglou 's side's defeat by Brighton less than an hour prior. Four unanswered goals, courtesy of a Joao Pedro brace and efforts from Jack Hinshelwood and Pervis Estupinan, threatened to make for a humiliating night. Before Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies replied to salvage some pride from the trip to the south coast, giving the Tottenham faithful something to cheer. Defoe also glaringly omitted the only other side currently occupying a place in the top four - Aston Villa. Unai Emery's team suffered a bruising 3-2 defeat to Manchester United on Tuesday, having led by two goals to nil, but the result does not detract from their blistering start to the campaign that sees them sat in third on 39 points. Tottenham by contrast have amassed three fewer points than the Villans at the halfway point of the campaign. Henry hilariously gives Defoe a quizzical look after the Tottenham icon gives his prediction While Defoe and Shearer gave their top-four predictions, Henry amusingly refused to Spurs are now a point behind fourth-placed Man City, who have a game in hand on their rivals The question for each pundit's top-four prediction came in the aftermath of shocking result for Arsenal which saw them lose at home to West Ham courtesy of goals in either half from Tomas Soucek and Konstantinos Mavropanos. When asked for his own top four predictions, Henry defiantly said: 'No!' Asked if Arsenal's defeat at the Emirates was 'a blip' and if they're still real title contenders this season, Henry responded: 'When we are top of the table at Christmas, we usually lose the league so I'm kind of happy about that.' Shearer prodded Henry again to give his top four prediction, which again Henry amusingly stood his ground saying: 'I won't answer. Call me whatever you want. I always give my answer after the festive period. 'Talk to me in and around February. You can't call [the league] before that. You'll be guessing. I don't like to guess.' As it stands, Liverpool lead the way at the halfway point in the season, sitting atop of the table with 42 points after 19 games played. Arsenal also suffered defeat on the same night on their north London rivals on Thursday It's All Kicking Off is an exciting new podcast from Mail Sport that promises a different take on Premier League football, with a show every Monday and Thursday this season. It is available on MailOnline , Mail+ , YouTube , Apple Music and Spotify Your browser does not support iframes. The Gunners now trail Jurgen Klopp's side by two points - a stark contrast from before the game when a win over Hammers would've made them the outright leaders going into the new year. Aston Villa are a point behind the Gunners on 39 points while Man City are three points off Arsenal - but have a game in hand. Defeat for Spurs leaves them in fifth but now have West Ham and Man United breathing down their necks as we begin to learn who will be in the top four picture come the business end of the season.",

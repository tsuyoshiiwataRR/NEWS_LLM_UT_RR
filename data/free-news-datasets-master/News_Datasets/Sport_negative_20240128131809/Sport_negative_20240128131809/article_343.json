    "text": "- Tomás Soucek (13')\n- Konstantinos Mavropanos (55')\nArsenal miss chance to reclaim top spot after loss to West Ham\nArsenal spurned the opportunity to retake first place in the Premier League as they lost 2-0 to fellow Londoners West Ham United at the Emirates on Thursday.\nWest Ham only had three efforts on target but\nTomas Soucek gave them a halftime lead before former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos extended the advantage after the break.\n-\nStream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nArsenal had more than twice as many chances but failed to take any as the visitors defended gamely.\n\"This is a very disappointing night for us,\" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta told reporters. \"We have to put the ball in [the net] and win it [the game].\"\nWest Ham took the lead against the run of play after 13 minutes when Soucek knocked home after a pull-back from\nJarrod Bowen, who looked as if he just managed to keep the ball in play.\n\"It's difficult because the ball was in the air,\" Bowen told Amazon Prime. \"It was hard to tell. It would have been easier to tell if it had been on the ground.\"\nAfter that it was an Arsenal blitz with\nBukayo Saka crashing the ball against the post and Gabriel Jesus missing two good opportunities before Mavropanos scored with a thumping header from a James Ward-Prowse corner in the 55th.\nWest Ham could have made it three from three chances but\nSaid Benrahma had a penalty saved in added time after a foul by former West Ham captain Declan Rice.\nThe defeat raises familiar questions about Arsenal's title credentials. They led the league this time last year only to falter in the run in and be overtaken by Manchester City.\nIt may have been one of those nights when things just did not happen in front of goal but finishing remains an issue.\nAs well as striking the post, Saka also had a near point-blank header stopped by Alphonse Areola, who made a string of fine saves in the second half too.\nJesus should have a scored when Arsenal were still one goal behind but headed over an open goal while fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli also missed good opportunities.\nThe win leaves West Ham in sixth place on 33 points and marked a landmark night for their manager David Moyes who had never won at Arsenal in the league in 22 attempts.\nSecond-placed Arsenal remain on 40 points, two behind\nLiverpool who beat Burnley 2-0 on Tuesday.\nGame Information\n- Referees:\n- Michael Oliver\nEnglish Premier League Standings\n|Team\n|GP\n|W\n|D\n|L\n|GD\n|P\nhttps://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/359/arsenal Aston Villa Manchester City Tottenham Hotspur https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/371/west-ham-united Manchester United Brighton & Hove Albion Newcastle United Chelsea Wolverhampton Wanderers AFC Bournemouth Fulham Brentford Crystal Palace Nottingham Forest Everton Luton Town https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/379/burnley Sheffield United\nPremier League News\nArsenal are interested in signing Bayern Munich centre-back Matthijs de Ligt, but it may not happen until the summer.

    "text": "- Arsenal fell to a 2-0 home defeat against West Ham on Thursday night - The Gunners missed an opportunity to leapfrog Liverpool and go top of the table - Watch out Liverpool and Arsenal! Man City are ready to do what they always do and hit top gear at this stage of the season – Listen to It’s All Kicking Off Mikel Arteta has insisted that Arsenal failed to ‘make a difference inside the box’ during their 2-0 defeat to West Ham on Thursday. The Gunners stunned by their London rivals after goals from Thomas Soucek and Konstantinos Mavropanos wrapped up all three points for the visitors on the night. The result saw Arsenal fail to overtake Liverpool and assert themselves at the top of the Premier League table, as the Hammers moved up to sixth. Speaking after the game, the Gunners boss suggested that his attackers failed to make a difference in the attacking third. Speaking on Amazon Prime after the game, Arteta said: ‘West Ham won the game but I think we deserved much more. Arsenal slipped up in the title race after a disappointing 2-0 defeat to West Ham on Thursday Afterwards, Mikel Arteta suggested his side did not have enough of an impact in the box Your browser does not support iframes. ‘We tried, and tried and tried but the difference was maybe in the boxes. You have to make the difference in the boxes’. Then, talking to BBC Sport, he continued: ‘We want to be at the top and today we are very, very disappointed. We had so much dominance in the game. ‘We are in a really good position. Today is a disappointing night. We have to pick ourselves up for a big game against Fulham.’ ‘It is what it is. The technology we have at the moment is not clear enough if the ball is out. ‘We dominated for 100 minutes. When we had big situations, we had players inside the box totally free. I think the players put an enormous effort in. ‘It’s a difficult dressing room right now but we have another game in 72 hours. This is football, we have to improve in certain areas.’ Arsenal had 30 shots in total during the game – compared to West Ham’s six – but still failed to come away with a point at the very least from the game. This year, Arsenal’s top goalscorers in the league are Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah, who have five top-flight goals each. The Gunners now sit two points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool in the table IT’S ALL KICKING OFF!

Various TV replays couldn’t categorically prove whether the ball had gone out. However, Mark Clattenburg claimed that the strike had to stand as there wasn’t conclusive evidence that the ball had gone out before Jarrod Bowen sent in a cross. Speaking on Amazon Prime, Clattenburg said: ‘There’s no other decision the officials can give. The on-field decision is a goal. We cannot be 100 per cent certain that the ball has gone out. As the ball has to be clearly over the line, there’s no conclusive evidence.’ *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12908305/Mikel-Arteta-claims-Arsenal-failed-make-difference-inside-box-fall-home-defeat-against-West-Ham-Spaniard-insists-Gunners-dominated-100-minutes.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",

And, finally, days before the season opener, the 7x NBA All-Star got his nod from the Milwaukee Bucks franchise. Since then, Lillard hasn‚Äôt looked back as he got what he wished for, a run at the championship. However, it didn‚Äôt sit well with one of his former teammates, as he gave his verdict ahead of his reunion game. America‚Äôs Favorite Video Today Zach Collins, who moved to the San Antonio Spurs in 2021 after spending 3 years with the Portland Trail Blazers, commented on the big Bucks trade. Ahead of the Spurs‚Äô game against the Blazers, Collins made his verdict. He said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely weird, it‚Äôs unfair‚Ä¶ to be in the transition when he is not here is definitely different.‚Äù Homecoming for [@zcollins_33]as he faces his former team. He goes one-on-one with [@DanWeissPBP]to talk about his return to Portland.

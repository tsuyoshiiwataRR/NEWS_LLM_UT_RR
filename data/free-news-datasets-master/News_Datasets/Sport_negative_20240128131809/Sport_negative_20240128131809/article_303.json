    "text": "[Arsenal](https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/) endured a tough evening on Thursday, losing 2-0 to West Ham United at the Emirates Stadium. The north Londoners had the chance to go to the top of the Premier League table if they were able to secure all three points. But Tomas Soucek broke the deadlock early on before Konstantinos Mavropanos doubled his side's lead in the second half. Mikel Arteta's side were unable to find an answer, losing their first match at home this season. After the full-time whistle, Gunners midfielder Declan Rice was spotted embracing Hammers boss David Moyes, with the two sharing a few words as they hugged. Of course, Rice was managed by Moyes during his time with West Ham, signing for Arsenal in the most recent summer transfer window, joining for a club-record Â£105million. The result means that the Gunners are still two points behind league leaders Liverpool, who beat Burnley 2-0 earlier in the week. Meanwhile, Aston Villa are just three points off the top whilst fourth-placed Manchester City are five behind the Reds, also having a game in hand on their title rivals.

    "text": "Arsenal have lost at home for the first time since May as a 2-0 defeat to West Ham cost Mikel Arteta's team the chance to return to the top of the Premier League.\nGoals by Tomas Soucek and former Arsenal player Konstantinos Mavropanos - combined with a stout defensive display - gave the Hammers a surprising win at Emirates Stadium and continued a mid-season blip by the Gunners.\nArsenal, who were in first place at Christmas, have won one of their last four in the league and need to beat Fulham away on Sunday to be in that position heading into 2024.\nThey are currently second, two points behind Liverpool, who don't play again until New Year's Day.\nIt could have been an even bigger loss, but Said Benrahma had a penalty saved by Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya in the sixth minute of stoppage time.\n\"I congratulate West Ham and praise my players,\" Arteta said.\n\"This is football. When you look at how much we generated in the game, to see the result is very disappointing.\n\"But they were better than us in both boxes. They had two shots, with the penalty three. We had 30.\n\"If we don't score with 30 shots, then we have to do 50 or 60 to try to score. That's the only thing.\n\"I can't imagine a game where we have more touches in the box, more dominance and less situations for the opponent against a really good West Ham side.\"\nThere was some controversy over the first goal, with cameras not showing definitively if the ball was out of play when Jarrod Bowen turned it back into the area for Soucek to force home.\n\"If the technology we have at the moment is not good enough to give us that answer, what we have to do is without that win the game,\" Arteta said.\n\"With the number of situations we generated, that should have been more than enough.\"\nBukayo Saka hit the post for Arsenal but the home side lacked their usual energy in attack and conceded again when James Ward-Prowse's corner was flicked home off the underside of the crossbar by Mavropanos.\nArsenal last lost at home in mid-May to Brighton, a defeat that virtually ensured the title last season would be heading to Manchester City and not the Gunners.\nThe win lifted West Ham to sixth, above Manchester United.\nAt the Amex Stadium, Tottenham's top-four credentials were damaged by a miserable performance in a 4-2 loss at Brighton.\nLate goals for Tottenham by Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies gave the score a respectable look but the visitors were outplayed by a Brighton team missing up to 10 players through injury.\nJack Hinshelwood powered a shot into the roof of the net in the 11th minute and Joao Pedro converted a penalty in the 23rd after Dejan Kulusevski pulled back Danny Welbeck in the area.\nRicharlison hit the post for Spurs and had a goal ruled out for offside before substitute Pervis Estupinan made it 3-0 with a shot from outside the area that flew into the top corner in the 63rd.\nJoao Pedro scored his second - again from the penalty spot - in the 75th after Evan Ferguson was fouled by Giovani Lo Celso, before Tottenham rallied late.\nVeliz netted his first Premier League goal in the 81st, and when Davies headed in Pedro Porro's cross four minutes later a sensational comeback was potentially on, but Brighton held on despite more chances for Ange Postecoglou's men.",

    "text": "Watch Now: Hankins (ankle) has been ruled out for Saturday's game against the Dolphins, Jon Machota of The Athletic reports.\nHankins continue to nurse an ankle injury that occurred in Week 14 versus Philadelphia. He hasn't been able to play since and may not be close to a return given that he wasn't able to practice in any capacity again this week. Hankins had been gaining some traction as a pass rusher before getting hurt, tallying three sacks across the two games prior to the injury.\nMore News Cowboys' Johnathan Hankins: Considered unavailable Tuesday 2D ago • by RotoWire Staff Cowboys' Johnathan Hankins: Missing second straight game 6D ago • by RotoWire Staff Cowboys' Johnathan Hankins: Won't play versus Buffalo 13D ago • by RotoWire Staff Cowboys' Johnathan Hankins: Has high-ankle sprain 18D ago • by RotoWire Staff Cowboys' Johnathan Hankins: Hurts ankle on SNF 18D ago • by RotoWire Staff Cowboys' Johnathan Hankins: Notches another sack 27D ago • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Football Stories Week 17 PPR Cheat Sheet Dave Richard • 3 min read Week 17 Non-PPR Cheat Sheet Dave Richard • 3 min read Week 17 RB Rankings Chris Towers • 1 min read Week 17 WR Rankings Chris Towers • 1 min read Week 17 QB Rankings Chris Towers • 2 min read Week 17 TE Rankings Chris Towers • 1 min read",

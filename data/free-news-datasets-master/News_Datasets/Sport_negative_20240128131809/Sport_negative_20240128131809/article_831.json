    "text": "The shots rained down from beyond the arc in the final seconds of Thursday’s game, but they all missed the target as Archie Williams High fell to Urban, 54-51, in a wild matchup on the second day of the Bambauer Tournament, hosted by Marin Catholic. “We’ve had other situations where we’ve fought back in games,” said Peregrine Falcons head coach Russell Bauer, whose team faces Heritage at 12:30 p.m. Friday in a consolation-round game. “I preach resiliency, the ability to have that next-play mentality, to stay as consistent as possible.” The Peregrine Falcons (5-7) were behind nearly the entire game, from the start until the final 5 minutes, but they managed to hang around, never trailing by more than 10 points. That kept the pressure on a hard-charging Urban Blues squad (9-3), which is preparing for a battle in the Bay Counties League West with San Domenico and University, which is also in the 16-team Bambauer Tournament. “I’m really proud of the way we played,” Bauer said. “Our defense in the second half was probably the best man-to-man we’ve played all season. We kept Urban’s best player (Jake Rodriguez) to 15 points in the game. We did a good job on rebounds and we had under 10 turnovers for the game. Those are some keys we harp on that we executed well.” Brian Wright led the Falcons with 14 points and 10 rebounds, while Julian Nichol added 10 points. “Brian Wright, this was the right type of game for him, a game where we could exploit their zone down low, which is perfect for him,” Bauer said. “I wish we could get Wright the ball more. He finishes at a high percentage in the block area. He did that in the second half where we were able to claw back.” Archie Williams faced a seven-point deficit at halftime but by the end of the third quarter, the gap had closed to four points. Two free throws from Dante Stallone evened the score at 44 apiece with 5 minutes, 6 seconds left to play, then Wright came in with a layup for the Falcons’ first lead of the game less than 90 seconds later. Urban dropped in five points with a jumper from Oscar Rohde and a 3-pointer by Mawa Silvestro in the next minute to retake the lead and never let go, despite Archie Williams’ furious attack. Owen Bugas scored five his nine points in the final 2:30 to keep the contest a one-shot showdown. His 3-pointer with 38 seconds left boosted the Falcons’ hopes. Archie Williams forced Urban to shoot free throws down the stretch and, with the ball back in their clutches, the Falcons shot away from beyond the arc, Each time however, the ball bounced off the rim, except for the one shot that went in after the referee had blown his whistle and didn’t count. “We’ve had some close buzzer-beater games,” Bauer said. “And we’ve had comebacks, so we expected to hit a few of those late shots.” Rodriguez scored a team-high 14 points for Urban, which got 12 points from Silvestro and 11 from Owen Brown. “The difference was shot-making,” Bauer said. “We missed six free throws and four ‘gimme’ layups. They laid the ball in the hoop and we didn’t. That was the difference in crunch time. We’ve got some positives coming out of this game today, however.” The Falcons close the book on 2023 with the Bambauer Tournament, then open MCAL play against Marin Catholic in Kentfield on Jan. 5. “We are very much looking forward to MCAL,” Bauer said. “I think we’re ready. We’ve had a tough schedule in the preseason. We have six sophomores and a freshman who’ve all matured quickly in past two months. I think we’re right in middle of a competitive MCAL. It’s going to take us being resilient and being ready to fight 32 minutes every game.”",

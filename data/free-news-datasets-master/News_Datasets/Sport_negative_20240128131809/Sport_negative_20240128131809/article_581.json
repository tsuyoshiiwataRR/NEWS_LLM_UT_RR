    "text": "Governing bodies should have their funding cut if they fail to protect female sports amid concern about trans- gender players, a leading think-tank says. A report by the Policy Exchange warns that gender ideology is risking the fairness and safety of competitions for women and girls. The analysis, which is backed by athletes including Martina Navratilova, Sharron Davies and Daley Thompson, highlights the major physical advantages which biological males have over females. The winning woman at this year's London Marathon would have been beaten by the 231st ranked male, it found. And every British 'long course' swimming record set by an elite female swimmer has been beaten by a teenage boy. In addition, at least three female records set at 5k community Parkrun events are held by biological males. Martina Navratilova of the USA takes part in the Legends All Access Hour at the Australian Open tennis tournament at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia, in 2020 Sharron Davies at the Beauty Awards in London, in 2019 The report highlighted concerns about 'gender self-ID', saying it 'fundamentally compromises fair and safe competition for women and girls within grassroots, amateur and elite sport'. Policy Exchange is now calling on sport governing bodies, the UK Government and the International Olympic Committee to restrict categories for women and girls to biological females at all levels of sport. Some 99.99 per cent of those taking part in sport and physical activity are not elite or professional, the report points out, meaning that grassroots competitions for females are 'much more likely' to be affected by the issue. In county athletics championships, the winning male from the slowest county in the 1,500m race in 2023 would have beaten the winning female in 27 out of 33 counties, the think-tank said. It recommends that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport should require all national governing bodies to update their policies within 12 months to ensure that there is a protected female single-sex category â€“ and that they should lose taxpayer funding if they fail to do so. Policy Exchange also says that Parkrun should be ordered to collect participant data based on biological sex and not gender identity, and update all relevant course records to reflect this within 12 months or lose tax- payer funding. Former Olympic swimmer Ms Davies said: 'There is a sense within sports policy that while we should protect the female category within elite sports, women and girls participating and competing at amateur levels should budge over. Former British decathlete Daley Thompson at the Laureus World Sports Awards ceremony at the Verti Music Hall in Berlin, Germany, in 2020 'They must 'be kind' and 'inclusive' while having to pretend it is not grossly unfair, demotivating and possibly unsafe to accommodate biological males within their races, teams and sports days. 'Every sport, at every level, from grassroots to elite, must ensure that the female category is ringfenced for biological females.' Ms Navratilova, the former world No 1 female tennis player and an 18-time grand slam champion, said: 'Female sport must be protected otherwise we risk not only alienating a generation of women, but also taking away dreams and possibilities of fairness and winning for girls and women.' Daley Thompson, two-time Olympic gold medallist in the decathlon, said: 'We risk alienating a generation of young female athletes if we cannot promise them fair and safe play from the grassroots level to the top. 'Categories exist to allow everyone the chance to participate, and the willingness to compromise this by policymakers within sport is a scandal.' A spokesman for Sport England, which is responsible for developing grassroots sport, said: 'In 2021, the Sports Council Equality Group published Transgender Inclusion in Domestic Sport Guidance. While it is up to sports to set their own rules, we work closely with all organisations we fund to ensure they meet all the agreed criteria and code for sports governance. 'In this challenging and emotive area of policy, we understand and accept that there are a wide range of personal views, and we urge respectful discourse on this matter, and that sports consider their duty of care to all athletes.'",

    "text": "F or the majority of boxing fans, Mike Tyson has been one of the greatest to ever do it in the Heavyweight division. Although he didn't last that long at the very top when he was a champion, there was a time in which he was the most feared man on the planet. In fact, there hasn't been another fighter everybody in the division feels absolutely terrified to fight as it happened with Mike . You could see opponents' eyes when they stepped inside a ring with him, they were scared out of their minds. But that fear didn't last for too long and even one of his trainers doesn't think Mike as one of the all-time greats. Surely many would disagree with this take. This trainer's name is Teddy Atlas and he was part of the first group of trainers the legendary boxer had during his career.\nMike Tyson delivers a profound message to those in search of life's meaning Roberto Ortega Teddy Atlas on Mike Tyson's greatness During a recent episode of the Lex Fridman Podcast, Teddy Atlas explained the reason he doesn't think Mike Tyson is one of the greats. Here's part of what he said: \"I don't know if he was ever great. I know he was sensational. I know he was the greatest mix of maybe speed and power ever. I know he was one of the greatest punchers from either side of the plate, left or right. There's been great punchers with just the right hand like Earnie Shavers and Deontay Wilder and Max Baer. I don't know if there's ever been anyone who could punch as good as (Tyson) did on either side with either hand other than Joe Louis and a few others.\"\nAtlas added: \"I don't know if there's ever been such a combination of speed and power to that pure level that he had, and it was a pure level. I don't know if there was ever as good a fighter as Tyson was for maybe one night he was great. He wasn't tested, but he might have been ready to be tested that one night against Michael Spinks when he took him apart in 90 seconds. I think I saw a great fighter that night. I don't think you can be great unless you have all the requirements of being great.\"",

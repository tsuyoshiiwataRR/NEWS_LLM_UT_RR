    "text": "Crystal Palace are considering replacing Roy Hodgson with Steve Cooper Officials believe they would not have to pay compensation to old side Forest Chris Sutton and Ian Ladyman give their best sporting moments of the year on It's All Kicking Off\nCrystal Palace believe they are clear to appoint Steve Cooper without paying compensation to Nottingham Forest amid growing uncertainty over Roy Hodgson’s position.\nHowever, Palace could face difficulty convincing Cooper to make a quick return to management following his City Ground departure last week, with sources indicating the Welshman is minded to take a short break from football.\nHodgson’s role is under scrutiny after eight games without a win, and Saturday’s match against Brentford is crucial for his prospects. Defeat could prove the final straw for Palace chiefs.\nMail Sport understands there is already a feeling among members of the club’s hierarchy that a change is needed. Others are reluctant to part ways with the highly-respected boss before the summer.\nCooper’s sacking at Forest last week has become a factor as Palace contemplate their next move.\nCrystal Palace believe they are clear to appoint ex-Forest boss Steve Cooper without paying compensation\nPalace chiefs – led by chairman Steve Parish (R) – feel that a change may be needed after eight games without a win under Roy Hodgson (L)\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nThe former Swansea manager is admired at Palace and has long been viewed as a potential successor to 76-year-old Hodgson.\nIt is understood Cooper is not subject to a period of gardening leave by Forest, meaning he can be appointed by his next club without a compensation fee.\nPalace chiefs had hoped Hodgson would see out the season before the club appointed a younger manager to implement a new approach.\nIf Palace lose to Brentford in their next game it will only pile the pressure on Hodgson\nBut Cooper’s availability, coupled with the team’s poor form, may force Palace into accelerating their vision, though that will depend on whether the 44-year-old is open to returning to work.\nIpswich boss Kieran McKenna also features on Palace’s list of candidates to replace Hodgson, while assistant manager Paddy McCarthy has impressed as part of the backroom team and could be elevated to the top job on a short-term basis.",

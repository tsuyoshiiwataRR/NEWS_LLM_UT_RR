[Try for £1](https://www.mailsubscriptions.co.uk/products/197224/1-for-3-months-then-12.99-a-month) [Sign in] ARSENAL blew the chance to go top of the Premier League table last night as they fell to a shock home defeat by West Ham. ANGE POSTECOGLOU blamed the tiredness of his injury-ravaged Tottenham squad after they suffered a thumping 4-2 defeat at Brighton last night. ARSENAL were left furious after West Ham’s controversial opener. Here’s what the pundits said: Moyes’ men march up to sixth as Arsenal flatline TOTTENHAM icon Hugo Lloris is set to join Los Angeles FC, bringing the curtain down on his 11-year stay in north London.

JOHN STONES is set for more tests on the worrying ankle injury he sustained at Everton on Wednesday but Manchester City hope the central defender will avoid a lengthy lay-off. Lewis Steele JUST like that, we’re into the second half of the Championship season. The table is starting to take shape and the arrival of crunch-time has left many clubs looking nervously behind them. So, ahead of a full fixture list tonight, Wonders of the Pyramid tests the temperature in the second tier… Associated Newspapers Limited is a company registered in England and Wales (Company No. 084121), Northcliffe House, 2 Derry Street, Kensington, London, W8 5TT.

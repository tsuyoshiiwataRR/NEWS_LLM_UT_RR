    "text": "Basil Zempilas has lashed the MCG crowd on Boxing Day Over 62,000 fans attended the rain-affected opening day But Zempilas took aim at the attendance on Tuesday\nOne week on from watching his city cop a lashing for the poorly-attended Perth Test, Basil Zempilas has launched an astonishing attack on the MCG crowd for the Boxing Day Test.\nPerth mayor Zempilas has staunchly defended the West Australia state despite there being plenty of empty seats during the first Test of the summer earlier this month.\nAnd when he saw legions of empty spaces at the MCG on Tuesday, Zempilas took to X – formerly known as Twitter – to bash Melbourne’s fans.\n‘Hmmmm. What’s their excuse? Not like you can go to the beach?’\nThe official crowd figure for the opening day of the Test was 62,167, which is the second highest crowd for the first day of a Test between Australia and Pakistan at the venue.\nBasil Zempilas has hit out at the Boxing Day Test attendance at the MCG\nHe took to Twitter to aim a dig at the Melbourne fans on Boxing Day\nIt is also more than the combined attendance at Perth, which was just over 59,000 across four days of action.\nIn that context, plus the standard of the opposition and the torrid weather in Melbourne over recent days, the official attendance figure doesn’t look too shabby.\nFans were quick to hit back at Zempilas after his rogue post.\n‘Probably get more on Day 1 with rain forecast for half the day than the entire crowd for 4 days of the Perth test,’ one fan said. ‘Just embarrassing yourself at this point.’\nAnother said: ‘This is even worse than your commentary Basil, and that is saying something.’\n‘You should have gone to the beach instead of posting your tweet,’ a third fan said.\nAustralia dodged the rain and survived some serious scares from Pakistan’s improved bowling attack to crawl to stumps on Boxing Day at 3-187 in the second Test.\nDespite losing almost three hours due to wild weather on Tuesday, the tourists managed to send down 66 overs to Australia in front of 62,167 spectators at the MCG after Pakistan captain Shan Masood won the toss and elected to bowl first.\nOver 62,000 fans went to the MCG on a rain-affected day on Tuesday\nA watchful Marnus Labuschange (44 not out from 120 balls) will return to the crease on Wednesday with Travis Head (9 not out), who copped a flying ball to the shoulder thanks to an accidental full toss from Pakistani quick Shaheen Afridi.\nPlay started on time on Tuesday as the sun shone brightly, but the skies quickly got dark after lunch and players went off the ground midway through the second session.\nSpectators were warned via the scoreboards to prepare for severe weather and ‘seek shelter from exposed areas’ as the MCG lights were turned on in the early afternoon.\nAfter being off the field for 170 minutes, players returned for almost two hours as play was extended for a further 90 minutes beyond the scheduled stumps time.",

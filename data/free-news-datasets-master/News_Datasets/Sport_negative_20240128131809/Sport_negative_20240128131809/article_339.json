    "text": "Erling Haaland is going to be out for a while longer.\nManchester City head coach Pep Guardiola said that the star forward could be out until the end of January as he continues to battle a foot injury.\nHaaland has already missed City’s past six games and after his side defeated Everton on Wednesday, Guardiola said the Norwegian would not be back in the near future.\n“[Haaland] is training alone but he is not training with the team,” Guardiola said. “Kevin [De Bruyne] is training with the team, but Erling is not yet. It is a question of when the pain will disappear.\n“We hope he will be back in January, but a stress on the bone is so painful. He is not like a guy like Phil Foden with smaller skin — Erling is huge.\n“He will be back and play. But it is up to the doctors. The doctors come every morning and say this player is available and this is not.”\nHaaland set a single-season Premier League goals record last season with 36, and currently leads all players in the division with 14 goals.\nThe news was better on De Bruyne, who has not played since suffering a hamstring injury during the opening game of the season.\n“Yeah he is close,” Guardiola said. “Today he had fatigue. We have to be careful. He is training with us and he is so positive. Soon he will be back.\n“I would love [him] to play the next game or Huddersfield, but it is important to keep fit for a long time.”\nCity returns to the pitch on Saturday with a league match against Sheffield United, before a FA Cup match against Huddersfield on January 7.\nRelated Premier League 2023-24 top scorers: Tracking the Golden Boot race Sorry folks, Kevin De Bruyne didn't write a song with Drake (he's a big fan though) The top 25 highest-paid Premier League players in 2023-24\nFollow all of Pro Soccer Wire's Premier League coverage right here.",

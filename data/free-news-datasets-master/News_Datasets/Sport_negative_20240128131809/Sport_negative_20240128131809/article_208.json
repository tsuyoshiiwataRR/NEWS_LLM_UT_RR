    "text": "Dyche criticises penalty laws after Everton lose to Man City\nEverton manager Sean Dyche has questioned how Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard's apparent handball against Liverpool wasn't a penalty if Amadou Onana was adjudged guilty of handball in their defeat to Manchester City on Wednesday night. The Toffees felt harshly done by when Julian Alvarez scored a penalty at Goodison Park to make it 2-1 to City.\nTrending While the ball clearly struck Onana's hand, Everton felt the midfielder was very close to Nathan Ake when the City defender took his shot on goal and that his hand was not necessarily in an unnatural position. Dyche called the decision for referee John Brooks to the point to the spot \"bizarre\" post-match.\nThe call came just days after Liverpool were denied a seemingly blatant penalty for a handball offence from Odegaard against Arsenal at Anfield. PGMOL said that the VAR did not overrule referee Chris Kavanagh because it was \"not a clear and obvious error\".\nThey also said the Norwegian's arm moved towards his body and not his ball and that it wasn't a deliberate or unnatural action from the attacking midfielder. Yet it was widely deemed an incorrect call and even Arsenal defender William Saliba reacted: \"Of course, it was a penalty. But, I'm not the referee and we have to accept [the decision].\"\nAnd Dyche said: \"When they [IFAB] come out with these rules, how many active football people, managers, do they speak to? And this can be across the board, it doesn't just have to be the Premier League .\nSean Dyche thinks Liverpool should have had a penalty vs Arsenal (Image: GETTY/SKY SPORTS)\nEverton midfielder Amadou Onana conceded a penalty against Man City (Image: GETTY) \"They may do that, but I have a feeling they probably don't. If they do, they keep it under wraps because I've never heard of it. Handball is such an odd thing. The one the other day from Odegaard, how's that not a penalty? It's just bizarre.\n\"And then our one, that's where we're going and how can those two things be that different in their outcome? You can't work it out. That to me is unfathomable and everyone is scratching their head.\"\nThe Everton manager has claimed all of the Premier League 's managers want to see the handball rule changed. He boss: \"Managers want to see a difference, especially when it's overpowering. The view on handball is overpowering, I don't mind telling you that.\n\"It's not a secret. We had a Zoom call, all the managers were there and they all said this has got to be changed. Roy Hodgson spoke very clearly, as he does about his feelings on it, and gave a couple of incidents and basically we all said we've no clue. It's a real head-scratcher.\n\"One week it's given, the next it's not. There wasn't anyone saying 'we're gaining' or 'we're losing', none of that. It was just that it was wrong on every level and all over the place.\nBecome an Express Premium member\nSupport fearless journalism\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free\nGet super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial READ MORE...\nMan Utd could be about to get rid of £86m flop Antony due to three names [COMMENT]\nJohn Terry identifies next Chelsea wonderkid ready to break into first team [OPINION]\nLiverpool may have saved themselves £50m-plus with player Virgil van Dijk loves [FEATURE]\nSean Dyche wants the Premier League handball law tweaked (Image: GETTY) \"Every manager said this has got to change. I just find the rule bizarre and I don't think anyone understands it.\" Ex-Everton boss Roberto Martinez, now in charge of the Portugal national team, said on broadcaster Amazon Prime: \"For me, it is not a penalty at all. For me, football people know that it is not a penalty.\"\nWhile ex- Premier League ref Mark Clattenburg added: \"We're discussing handball for many, many years and we are still no further forward of actually improving it. One week it is given, one week it's not. Is it deliberate or is it not?\n\"Is the arm outstretched or is it not? Every week we are debating it and the referees are just trying to apply the Laws of the Game. If the referee didn't give that penalty, he would be criticised.\n\"He has given it and is criticised. The law needs changing and it needs the coaches, players and referees to get round and try to find a better way to understand handball.\"\nRelated articles Premier League rule has saved Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag from another cruel blow Man Utd receive transfer response as Erik ten Hag 'eyes second January deal'",

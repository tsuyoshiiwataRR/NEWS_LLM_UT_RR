    "text": "[Vinicius Junior](https://tribuna.com/en/persons/vinicius-junior/) inadvertently became the center of a peculiar national team expulsion saga. Well, not Vinicius exactly - only his [Brazil](https://tribuna.com/en/team/brazil/) shirt. A seemingly innocuous act has led to the sidelining of [Guinea](https://tribuna.com/en/team/guinea/) midfielder [Morlaye Sylla](https://tribuna.com/en/persons/morlaye-sylla-19980727/) from the upcoming [Africa Cup of Nations](https://tribuna.com/en/league/africa-cup/). The controversy originated after Guinea's 4-1 loss to Selecao in June 2023, where Sylla swapped shirt with the [Real Madrid](https://tribuna.com/en/clubs/real-madrid/) star. But the thing is, the shirt mysteriously vanished from the dressing room shortly after. Sylla pointed fingers at all his teammates, even accusing Guinea boss [Kaba Diawara](https://tribuna.com/en/persons/kaba-diawara/) of theft, insisting on a comprehensive search of the dressing room, which deeply offended the coach. Despite being capped 23 times before, Sylla faces the consequences for the incident and will miss the much-anticipated tournament scheduled for mid-January.",

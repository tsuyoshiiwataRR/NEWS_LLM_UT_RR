Shannon traveled to Lawrence, Kansas on Thursday where he turned himself and was returning to Champaign after posting bail, officials said.\nThe incident allegedly occurred when Shannon traveled to Lawrence to watch the Illini football team play at Kansas on the evening of Sept. 8, school officials said.\nCHAMPAIGN, IL - NOVEMBER 07: Terrence Shannon Jr. #0 of the Illinois Fighting Illini brings the ball up court during the game against the Eastern Illinois Panthers at State Farm Center on November 7, 2022 in Champaign, Illinois.

We will rely on that policy and our prior experiences to manage this situation appropriately for the University and the involved parties.\nMark P. Sutter, of Sutter Law Group LLC, released the following statement, defending Shannon:\n\"Since September, when these allegations surfaced, Terrence has cooperated with law enforcement throughout the investigation, declaring his innocence from the beginning. Now, several months later, my office learned that formal charges were filed against him yesterday in Lawrence, KS. In less than 24 hours, my client responded, and he voluntarily surrendered to local authorities for processing and release. Terrence is innocent of these charges, and he intends to take his case to trial.\"",

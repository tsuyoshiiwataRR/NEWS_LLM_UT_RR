    "text": "Tottenham Hotspur captain Son Heung-min has delivered a brutal verdict on his team’s performance away at Brighton & Hove Albion. The [Spurs](https://tbrfootball.com/category/english-premier-league/tottenham-hotspur/) forward admitted that his side’s performance in Thursday night’s [Premier League](https://tbrfootball.com/category/english-premier-league/) loss was “very disappointing” and “nowhere near the level” required. Tottenham fell to a 4-2 defeat on the south coast, and their two goals came in the latter stages of the match after they were already four down. Jack Hinshelwood opened the scoring in the 11th minute with a powerful strike, before Joao Pedro netted a 23rd-minute penalty to put the Seagulls two up by the break. Tottenham then shipped two more goals in the second half. Pervis Estupinan let rip with a fierce long-range shot on 63 minutes for the third, before Pedro netted another spot kick. To their credit, Spurs did threaten a fightback. Alejo Veliz opened his account for Tottenham in the 81st minute before Ben Davies added a second four minutes later. However, it was too little too late for Spurs, who leave the Amex Stadium empty-handed as their three-match winning run came to an abrupt end. MORE TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STORIES “It is a very disappointing performance,” Son told Premier League Productions, via the [BBC Sport website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/football/67255960?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=658dee66f825603c1a381138%26%27This%20has%20to%20be%20a%20big%20wake-up%20call%27%262023-12-28T21%3A54%3A40.500Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:c358eecb-cc18-4563-a4ca-30e6984af70f&pinned_post_asset_id=658dee66f825603c1a381138&pinned_post_type=share). “This is not how we’ve approached the season. This performance was nowhere near the level we want to play at. “We know what our mistakes were but now is not the time to point fingers at each other because the games are coming fast. “We have to talk about the first half and the early parts of the second half rather than the end, we know we have to play like that from minute one, we have to take the lesson again and move on. “Every team is strong in the Premier League and if we’re not playing like the last 15 minutes in every game we’re going to struggle and this has to be a big wake-up call.” Spurs missed the chance to return into the top four of the Premier League table, while Roberto De Zerbi’s side moved seven points behind fourth-placed Manchester City. Ange Postecoglou’s charges will seek to make amends when they host Bournemouth at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Sunday’s 2pm kickoff.",

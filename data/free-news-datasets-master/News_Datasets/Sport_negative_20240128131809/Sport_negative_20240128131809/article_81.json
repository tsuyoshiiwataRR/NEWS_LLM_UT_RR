    "text": "Ja’Marr Chase has disrespectful take on Chiefs’ defense\nCincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase is not exactly showing a lot of respect for the Kansas City Chiefs’ defense ahead of their meeting on Sunday.\nChase was dismissive of the Chiefs’ talent, admitting that they run a lot of double teams and are good at nullifying Cincinnati’s strengths. He implied that scheme was the reason for their success against the Bengals, and argued that they lack any real impact talent on that side of the ball.\nJa’Marr Chase had quite the edge after practice today addressing reporters. Said Chiefs don’t have anyone that stands out on defense. “It’s not really like have a Jalen Ramsey on their squad.”\n[pic.twitter.com/1kurBwcOLF]\n— Mike Petraglia (@Trags)\n[December 28, 2023]\n“It’s not like they got a Jalen Ramsey on their squad,” Chase said.\nChase shrugged off the prospect of the Chiefs using his comments as motivation.\nJa’Marr Chase didn’t back track at all when asked about his assessment of Chiefs defense. “They can take it how they want. I don’t care. … I’m not Ironman. I can’t throw the ball to myself. It’s a team sport.”\n[pic.twitter.com/KmnaKIcLYe]\n— Mike Petraglia (@Trags)\n[December 28, 2023]\n“They can take it how they want. I don’t care,” Chase said. “That’s why they double everybody. Because they can’t do it one-on-one.”\nChase isn’t necessarily wrong about the Chiefs lacking big names on defense, particularly in the secondary. However, top cornerback L’Jarius Sneed has had an excellent season, and Chase did acknowledge him as the best player in that unit.\nThe Chiefs and Bengals\nhave developed a strong rivalry in recent years. There may have been some worries that this game might not be quite as intense with the Chiefs struggling and Joe Burrow sidelined for the Bengals, but Chase is doing his part to ensure that is not the case.",

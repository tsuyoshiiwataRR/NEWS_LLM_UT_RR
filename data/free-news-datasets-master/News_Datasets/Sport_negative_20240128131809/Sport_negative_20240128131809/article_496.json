    "text": "Washington is set to face Texas in the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Day, closing out the opening round of the\nCollege Football Playoff.\nA few Huskies gave the Longhorns some bulletin board material in the pregame leadup.\nMichael Penix was one of a number of UW players asked about a UT defensive line that anchors the Big XII’s top-ranked defense. That group bolstered a run defense that surrendered the\nthird-least rushing yards in the nation while getting after opposing quarterbacks in the passing game by averaging 2.5 sacks per contest.\nHere’s what Penix had to say about that front four.\n[#Washington]QB Michael Penix Jr. on facing [#Texas]‘ defensive line anchored by 2023 Outland Trophy winner [@TvondreSweat]and [#Big12]D-Lineman OTY [@ByronMurphyII]: “They play good ball, but I wouldn’t say we’re playing the 49ers’ D-line or the Eagles’ D-line, so we’ll be good.”\n— Chip Brown (@ChipBrown247)\n[December 28, 2023]\n“They play good ball, but I wouldn’t say we’re playing the 49ers’ D-line or the Eagles’ D-line, so we’ll be good.”\nNot outright disrespect, but Penix is certainly downplaying the group’s potential impact on the game.\nHuskies running back Dillon Johnson sang a similar tune when\nasked the same question, though he did so without the backhanded jab.\n“I played in the SEC. It’s nothing new to me. I’ve played Bama and Georgia. I’m used to it. I’m ready for it.”\nJohnson is a former Mississippi State Bulldog, so he’s seen strong defensive line play before. Will Texas compare to those SEC defensive lines of Johnson’s past?\nIt should certainly be a matchup of strength vs. strength.\nThe Washington offense has been electric throughout the year, led by their quarterback, who paces the nation in passing. The offensive line has been able to keep him upright, having allowed just 11 sacks on the season.\nThe Texas defense will be looking to slow that attack, and it will start at the line of scrimmage. Who will win out?\nYou can bet these words will be on the Longhorns’ minds as the front four looks to make its presence felt come playoff time.",

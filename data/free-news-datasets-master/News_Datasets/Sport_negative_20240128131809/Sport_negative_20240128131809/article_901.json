Photo credit: South Australia Surfing / Facebook, Lauryn Barley / GoFundMe A 15-year-old boy killed in a shark attack off the coast of South Australia (SA) is being remembered as a talented and passionate member of the surfing community.\nKhai Cowley was mauled by a suspected great white at about 1.30pm on Thursday while surfing at the remote Ethel beach on the Yorke Peninsula, west of Adelaide.\nEmergency services rushed to the scene and recovered Cowley's body from the water but were unable to save him.\nIt's understood he had been bitten on the leg.\nCowley was from Masline Beach in Adelaide's south, police said.\nSurfing South Australia paid tribute to him on Friday in a Facebook post.\nMore from Newshub\n'The sharks' home': The major Kiwi harbour that's become a 'pupping ground' for great white sharks\nRevealed: 'Got a lot of prey species' - where sharks are roaming in NZ waters \"We have been keeping Khaiâ€™s family and friends in our thoughts,\" the post read.\n\"Khai was very involved in our surfing community with his passion for surfing stemming from a family with deep surfing roots in SA.\n\"He was a happy, kind and respectful kid, very much loved by his surfing peers and he will be greatly missed out in our community and on the water.\"\nCowley was part of the surf club Microgroms Junior Boardriders, who sent \"love and support\" to his family.\n\"Khai was a member since 2016 and will be remembered as a good friend and talented surfer who was well respected and admired by all that knew him.\"\nRyan Valente, a skipper who operates in the area with Reef Encounters, told ABC Radio it was unusual to see great whites in the area.\n\"It's stuff nightmares are made of,\" he said. \"Our hearts go out to the family.\"\nAndrew Fox, a researcher at the Rodney Fox Shark Museum, said the rough weather and murky conditions on Thursday would have increased shark activity.\n\"They're more motivated, bigger swell, dirty water,\" he told the ABC. \"Anything that increases the chances of an ambush predator.\"\nA GoFundMe fundraiser set up by Cowley's aunt has so far raised more than NZ$37,000 with the goal of covering the costs of the funeral.",

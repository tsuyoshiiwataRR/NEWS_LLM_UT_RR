Tomas Soucek struck in the 13th minute, with the goal being given after a lengthy delay due to doubts over whether the ball went out of play.\nKonstantinos Mavropanos, playing against his former side, added a second for West Ham in the 55th minute. Said Benrahma won a penalty in stoppage time, but David Raya did well to deny the forward. However, it didn't matter as the visitors came away with all three points.\nSeveral players endured off-nights for Arsenal, who struggled to break down a disciplined West Ham side defending in numbers in and around the box. Among the hosts' underperformers was Saka, who completed none of his four dribbles, missed two big chances and lost possession 19 times.\nThis in turn saw him incur the wrath of Gooners on X (formerly Twitter), with one of them writing:\n\"Saka did absolutely nothing, all the Arsenal attackers needs to work on finishing #ARSWHU \" Expand Tweet Another tweeted that Saka's new haircut resembled that of Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford. Rashford has struggled so far this season, recording just two goals and five assists in 23 matches across competitions.\n\"Saka dyed his hair like Rashford now he plays like him, [Gabriel] Martinelli against a low block is [Antony], [Oleksandr] Zinchencko at fault for the last three concededâ€¦ Dare I say it, we actually missed [Kai] Havertz!,\" the fan wrote. Expand Tweet Here are some more fan reactions:\nExpand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Saka played all 90 minutes of Arsenal's contest against West Ham. He took nine shots, five of which were blocked, while three were on target and one hit the woodwork. The Englishman also won just five of his 15 duels and found a teammate with only two of his eight crosses.\nTo his credit, though, Saka recorded four key passes, created a key chance, won two fouls and made four tackles as well.",

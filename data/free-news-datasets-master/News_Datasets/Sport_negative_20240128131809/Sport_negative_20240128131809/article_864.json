    "text": "ATP has recently updated its player profiles according to the latest season-ending results, which left the\nNovak Djokovic fans enraged. They updated the Serb’s profile but left it with more problems than before. While his records are updated, he is still not the leader in the ATP Finals and is equaled. Djokovic is the only player with seven titles at the ATP Finals but it shows that he shares the record.\nThe facts are not the only thing wrong, but there are a lot of formatting errors on the whole page, making it difficult to read. Including spacing errors and editing problems makes the whole bio seem boring and far from being interesting.\nFans who noticed this are enraged and have started firing shots at the ATP. “ATP has a bad case of Djokovic Derangement Syndrome” tweeted a fan on the post. Here are a few more plethora of comments from the disappointed fans.\nThere has always been a supposed problem with the ATP and Novak Djokovic. Over the years, fans have seen ATP covering up a few of the Serb’s records or his records are being overshadowed by other players.\nFrom not nominating Djokovic for any awards to not updating his player profile, the ATP is showing some hindrance when it comes to the 36-year-old. Novak Djokovic discloses Kobe Bryant’s advice to him when he considered retiring with only 12 Grand Slam titles to his name\nNovak Djokovic remains unshaken by unfair treatment by ATP\nOver the past few weeks, fans have witnessed a rise in incidents where the ATP has been unfair towards Novak Djokovic. The fans have always been there for their player despite this. They were left outraged when the ATP overlooked Novak Djokovic’s name for any award category, despite his stellar performance throughout the year.\nLater, the fans called out the organization for not\nupdating Djokovic’s page, which was updated a week after their complaining. Despite all this, the World No. 1 has never spoken about this and continues to mind his own business.\nAs the calendar year flips a new page, the players also turn over a new leaf, looking forward to a new season. Djokovic will start his new season a little early by featuring in the United Cup before heading to Australia where he defends his title at the\nAustralian Open.\nIn Case You Missed It:\nIga Swiatek admits she’s grown in handling the pressure of being World No. 1 as she looks forward to the 2024 season Roberto Bautista Agut recalls his horrific injury of getting his leg crushed by the horse he fell from\n- Do follow us on:\n- Follow FirstSportz on\nWhatsApp Channel Nikhil Sonmali",

    "text": "I t's been almost a year since Mo Bamba left the Orlando Magic . The Philadelphia 76ers center spent the first four and a half years of his NBA career with the Florida team, which he faced on Wednesday night, although with an unexpected obstacle.\nBamba was selected sixth overall by Orlando in the 2018 draft and remained with the team until February 2023, when he left to join the Los Angeles Lakers . The latter released him in the offseason, and that was when he landed in Philadelphia .\nIn the months since his departure from Magic , the 26-year-old had not had the opportunity to face his former teammates until this Wednesday, when the 76ers visited the Kia Center .\nHowever, what was supposed to be a sporting reunion with his old friends turned into a fun situation due to the interference of his former colleague Cole Anthony .\nAnthony's fine In the days before the game, it emerged that Anthony had warned his teammates that anyone who interacted with Bamba during the game would receive a \"personal fine\" from him.\nAlthough the amount or type of fine Anthony would impose on anyone-player or coach-who interacted with his former teammate is unknown, everyone ultimately heeded the threat and took good care not to approach Bamba .\nFortunately, the ban was only in effect for the duration of the match . After the final whistle, everyone was as friendly as ever.\nBamba out of Magic Just on Monday the 25th, Bamba gave one of the best performances of his career. The center came off the bench to contribute 18 points, six rebounds, two assists, and two steals in the Philadelphia 119-113 loss to the Miami Heat .\nAgainst Orlando , the University of Texas graduate was not so lucky since he played 16:18 minutes, went without points, captured seven rebounds, gave one assist, and stole a ball.",

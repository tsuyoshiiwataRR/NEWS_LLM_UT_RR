    "text": "Game Balls: NC State’s loss to Kansas State in Pop-Tarts Bowl\nORLANDO, Fla. — NC State entered the Pop-Tarts Bowl with its sights set on the elusive 10th win to cap its 2023 season, but Kansas State had other ideas at Camping World Stadium on Thursday evening.\nThe Wildcats rushed for 258 yards, including running back DJ Giddens’ 152 yards and a touchdown, to hold off a second-half NC State comeback effort in a 28-19 result. The Wolfpack scored 9 points in the second half, and pitched a shutout for most of the period, but the Wildcats went on a 15-play, 72-yard drive over 7:24 to ice the game with under three minutes to play.\nTheWolfpacker.com is acknowledging those that made an impact for the Pack in the postseason loss.\nQB Brennan Armstrong: In the early going, NC State’s entire offense revolved around Armstrong’s legs. He had 11 attempts for 86 yards by the time the Wolfpack hit 100 total yards of offense in the first half. But once the Wolfpack offense got into a rhythm, Armstrong was able to use his arm to his advantage as well. The graduate quarterback dropped a deep ball into wide receiver Dacari Collins’ arms in the third quarter for a 38-yard strike — the drive ended with a Brayden Narveson 49-yard field goal. Armstrong finished the night 14-of-28 passing for 164 yards and an interception, while he rushed for 121 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries. The Shelby, Ohio, native became the first NC State rusher to eclipse 100 yards in a game this season. WR Kevin Concepcion: The Wolfpack’s do-it-all wide receiver battled what appeared to be a nagging injury during the game, but he toughed it out and was able to be effective for NC State. Concepcion had a 40-yard snag in the third quarter to help flip the field for NC State on a catch that he had to adjust mid route to catch Armstrong’s pass. Concepcion finished the night with seven receptions for 72 yards, 3 carries for 23 yards and one incomplete pass. TE Trent Pennix: The graduate tight end put his mark on the contest via the special teams unit in the third quarter. He took a direct snap on a punt at the Pack 40-yard line and ran directly up the middle of the field to coast into the end zone for a 60-yard rushing touchdown. That score made it a 21-19 game after the 2-point conversion failed. Pennix also added a catch for 11 yards, including nine yards after the catch. S Sean Brown: NC State’s hard-hitting safety was a busy man against Kansas State. Brown flew all around the field and was key in several third-down stops for the Pack. He led the team with a pair of pass breakups, while he logged one of the five NC State tackles for a loss in the Pop-Tarts Bowl for the red and white. Brown was tied for the team high with seven total tackles, including four solo stops.",

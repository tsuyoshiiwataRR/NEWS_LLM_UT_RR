He had six points and three rebounds in limited minutes against Milwaukee.\nThe Nets also opted to rest starters Spencer Dinwiddie , Nic Claxton and Cameron Johnson and crucial reserve Dorian Finney-Smith in the Milwaukee game. Like Bridges, Cam Thomas – the leading scorer for Brooklyn – and veteran wing Royce O'Neale did not re-enter the game after the first quarter.\nNets coach Jacque Vaughn explained that the decision to limit playing time and rest key players was made to preserve their health:\n\"I have too much respect for the dudes that suit up and put their body on the line and the competition level to even mention the word exhibition,\" Vaughn said. \"Any guy could have ended their career tonight by one play, and so I treat it as such.\" Expand Tweet The Nets, currently standing at a 15-16 record, are scheduled to resume play on Friday with an away game against the Washington Wizards, who hold a 5-25 record.\nMikal Bridges keeps his Iron Man streak alive Mikal Bridges is known for his durability.

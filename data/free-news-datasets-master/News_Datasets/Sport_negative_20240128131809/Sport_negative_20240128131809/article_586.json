    "text": "Denver Broncos finally dropped the bomb that they are benching Russell Wilson for the remaining two games of this regular season, as they promoted backup QB Jarrett Stidham. However, fans are certainly not happy with the decision as a shocking comparison of stats emerged on the internet surface.\nThe franchise came to this decision, mainly to save money as the\nquarterback Wilson has refused to renounce his injury guarantees of the contract. Given that, sources say the Broncos are planning to release Wilson in March and end the 5-year contract after two failed seasons.\nThis season has particularly been really hard on the quarterback, as well as on the Broncos, who are standing with a 7-8 season record. However, when it comes to individual performance, the 35-year-old had\nplayed to the level he was expected. And so does he believe!\nAs for the shocking comparison of stats on social media, Wilson liked a post where a comparison was drawn between him and the star quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs,\nPatrick Mahomes. It showed Wilson’s stats are better than that of the reigning Super Bowl MVP.\nThe post read, “Wilson is now getting BENCHED despite outplaying some of the league’s biggest stars,” showing both Wilson and Mahomes have 26 touchdowns and 6.8 yards per attempt, this season. In fact, Wilson logged fewer interceptions (8) than Mahomes (14).\nWATCH: ‘Hyped up’ Christian Wilkins nearly knocks over 83-year-old Dolphins owner Stephen Ross in excitement following victory over the Cowboys\nFans reaction to benched Russell Wilson’s stats better than Patrick Mahomes\nConsidering this season’s 15 games, Wilson has recorded 3,070 yards along with 26 touchdowns and eight interceptions. He has a completion percentage of 66%. Fans are absolutely not happy with the\nBroncos’ decision to bench Wilson.\nThey don’t have any leading options and they can’t get any better than Wilson at this stage. These two seasons have truly been a clear-cut failure for the quarterback. One fan wrote, “Here before the Russ slander for no reason at all broncos will pay they’re gonna go downhill from here,” while another wrote, “Has nothing to do with his play. Has to do with the $37 mil injury guarantee in his contract for next year. Make sense now?”\nWith Wilson being benched, there seemed to be a debate over the internet, as some defended him, others reasoned his benching.\nIn Case You Missed It:\nAaron Rodgers puts Josh Allen in the ‘MVP conversation’ despite Bills’ underwhelming 9-6 record WATCH: “F**k your records Dan!” – Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel’s strong message for Dan Marino goes viral\n- Do follow us on:\n- Follow FirstSportz on\nWhatsApp Channel Gerard Crispin",

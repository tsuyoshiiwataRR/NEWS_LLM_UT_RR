    "text": "NEW ORLEANS – The New Orleans Pelicans have not given their fans much reason for holiday cheer, having lost three of their last four games, with all of those defeats happening inside the walls of the Smoothie King Center. Worse than that, the losses have come in horrible fashion, with the Pelicans squandering fourth quarter leads in each game. In fact, nine of their 14 losses this season have come in games where New Orleans has held a double-digit lead. The Pels are 5-8 in clutch games this season, and 0-9 in games decided by three points or less. During these last four games, they’ve failed to find any semblance of rhythm or fight when the games have mattered most. |Category||Game (Rank)||4Q (Rank)| |ORTG||114.9 (19)||106.5 (26)| |DRTG||110.8 (4)||138.7 (30)| |NET||4.1 (11)||-32.2 (30)| |AST/TO||1.84 (18)||1.36 (27)| |REB%||49.9 (16)||40.0 (30)| |TOV%||12.9 (12)||15.2 (26)| |TS%||57.6 (21)||55.0 (22)| |Pace||96.73 (29)||92.5 (23)| |Possessions||396 (23)||92 (26)| The production of the Pels’ “Big 3” of Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, and CJ McCollum in the fourth quarter has dropped compared to last season. So far, the trio is posting averages of 15.5 points, 3.9 rebounds, 3.2 assists, and 1.8 turnovers in the final frame, with an average +/- of -1.96 (51.3 FG%, 38.7 3P%, 71.0 FT%). During the 2022-23 campaign they averaged 17.7 pts, 3.5 rebs, 3.7 asts, and 1.8 turnovers, with an average +/- of 1.3 (50.7 FG%, 38.4 3P%, 72.2 FT%). That’s a swing of -3.26 in the wrong direction. Tonight’s opponent, the Utah Jazz, are already 2-0 versus the Pelicans this season. Those wins came by a total of seven points. In the first meeting, New Orleans led by nine heading into the fourth quarter before being dominated in the fourth quarter and outscored by 13 points. In the second, the Jazz made enough plays to hold off the Pelicans late and squeeze out a two-point victory. Utah was left for dead after the departures of Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, but they have continued to be a pest for the Pelicans, winning five in a row against New Orleans since the start of last season. Following the Jazz, the Pelicans face a nine-game stretch of playoff contenders that will take them right up to the halfway point of the season. With the fluid nature of the Western Conference, a poor run through those games could take New Orleans from the middle to the bottom of the pack in the race for the postseason. The New Orleans Pelicans, five years into the Zion Williamson/David Griffin era, are still in search of an identify and waiting for a leader to emerge. Until those things happen, every game will continue to be a coin toss as to knowing which Pelicans team will show up. That’s not what was expected at this stage of the process. The Pelicans should be better. The fans deserve better. Is better still a viable option? That remains to be seen.

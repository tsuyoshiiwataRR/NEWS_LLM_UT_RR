    "text": "University of Illinois basketball player Terrence Shannon Jr. is pictured during a Dec. 17, 2023, game. (Credit: Illinois Fighting Illini)\nIllinois men’s basketball star guard Terrence Shannon Jr. has been suspended from the team after being charged in Kansas with rape, according to university officials.\nThanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors The University of Illinois confirmed that the Douglas County District Attorney’s office in Kansas issued an arrest warrant for Shannon on Wednesday. He has since turned himself in to police in Lawrence, Kansas, posted bail and is now returning to Illinois.\nFollowing news of the criminal case, Shannon was suspended from all team activities, effective immediately.\n“The University and DIA have shown time and again that we have zero tolerance for sexual misconduct,” Illinois Director of Athletics Josh Whitman said in a statement. “At the same time, DIA policy affords student-athletes appropriate levels of due process based on the nature and severity of the allegations. We will rely on that policy and our prior experiences to manage this situation appropriately for the University and the involved parties.”\nAccording to the university, the alleged incident occurred Sept. 8, when Shannon attended the Illinois at Kansas football game in Lawrence. Shannon, the university said, was not at the game “on official University business, nor was he a member of the University’s travel party.”\nThe university’s Division of Intercollegiate Athletics and campus officials have been aware of the police investigation since late September but, until Wednesday, had yet to receive actionable information.”\n“Shannon’s arrest triggers the DIA student-athlete misconduct policy,” the university said. “Under that policy, Shannon has been immediately suspended from all team activities. Any change to Shannon’s status will be communicated in a timely manner.”\nShannon, a 6-foot-6 senior guard who attended Lincoln Park High School in Chicago before transferring to IMG Academy in Florida, has spent the last two seasons with Illinois after beginning his college career with Texas Tech. He is averaging 21.7 points per game this season for the 11th ranked Illini.",

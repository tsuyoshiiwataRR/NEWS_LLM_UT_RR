    "text": "Von Miller is finally breaking his silence on last month’s domestic violence arrest.\nThe\nBuffalo Bills star pass rusher was available to the media on Thursday when he commented on the incident that led to his arrest. Miller was accused of choking his pregnant ex-girlfriend in Dallas during the team’s bye week.\nMiller adamantly denied the allegations, saying that they are “100 percent false.”\n“Whenever you see that stuff pop up in articles and stuff … it’s shocking of course, especially when my name is attached to it,” Miller said, via\nSyracuse.com. “but it is 100% false. It’s overblown. I’ve got the right people on the job.”\nVon Miller speaking to the media today for the first time since the alleged incident on November 30th\n[#BillsMafia]| [#GoBills]| [#BuiltinBuffalo]\n[pic.twitter.com/ICUrr57mwL]\n— Built in Buffalo (@BuiltInBuffalo_)\n[December 28, 2023]\nHe added, “Me and my girlfriend, we have problems just like any other couple does. But there has never been any of those things that was alleged against me. … The people who know me and the people who have been around me know my character, they know who I am.\n“All I can say is it is just a matter of time before everything gets set straight. For me, that’s all I really have to say is it didn’t happen and it’s just a matter of time before everything is set straight.”\nMiller has continued to suit up for the Bills and has not been criminally charged as the investigation continues.",

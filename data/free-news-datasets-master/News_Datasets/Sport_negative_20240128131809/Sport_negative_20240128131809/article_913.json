    "text": "Arsenal manager [Mikel Arteta](https://www.premierleague.com/managers/53055/Mikel-Arteta/overview) says his side were not good enough in either box during their 2-0 home defeat to [West Ham United](https://www.premierleague.com/clubs/25/West-Ham-United/overview), as they missed the chance to go top of the table. [close] TV Info The Gunners had 74 per cent of the possession and faced only three shots on target, but they conceded from two of those attempts, while [David Raya](https://www.premierleague.com/players/7975/David-Raya/stats) saved a penalty in the final moments. At the other end of the pitch, [Arsenal](https://www.premierleague.com/clubs/1/Arsenal/overview) had 77 touches in the opposition box, the most on record since 2008/09 in a single Premier League fixture for a team who failed to score. They also had 30 shots. “I'm very proud of our players with the performance that they put in again, but the difference was made in both boxes,\" Arteta told the [club's official website](https://www.arsenal.com/news/we-want-improve-and-evolve?utm_source=premier-league-website&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=website). “We have two situations to defend, with the penalty three, and they weren’t good enough and then we generated a huge amount of situations, chances and shots. “I think it is our record in terms of touches in the box in the Premier League, and we still haven’t scored a goal. “So hopefully that won't happen again and it's really unlikely to happen, but the team kept trying and they did everything they could to win the game and I don't think that this scoreline reflects actually what happened on that pitch.” Arsenal will have another chance to go top of the table on Sunday when they [visit Fulham](https://www.premierleague.com/match/93513) in another London derby, the day before leaders [Liverpool host Newcastle United](https://www.premierleague.com/match/93514).",

    "text": "Osimhen and Kvaratskhelia fire Napoli past Cagliari and into top fourFootball Football fans took Oleksandr Zinchenko to the cleaners following his subpar performance against West Ham United on Thursday, December 28. The versatile Ukrainian's string of nightmarish performances appears not to be ending any moment from now as he experienced another sub-standard display, this time against the Hammers. Having experienced a horrific outing against Mohammed Salah in Arsenal's Premier League game against Liverpool, the former [Manchester City](https://sportsbrief.com/football/manchester-city/) defender was expected to rewrite the scripts against West Ham's attackers. Unfortunately, it was the same outcome, as West Ham's attack led by Jarrod Bowen ran the 27-year-old rugged on the left flank. And after another no-show in the first stanza of Arsenal's home tie against David Moyes' charges, fans slammed Zinchenko's performance. Osimhen and Kvaratskhelia fire Napoli past Cagliari and into top fourFootball He was rated 4/10 by [GOAL](https://www.goal.com/en-gh/lists/arsenal-player-ratings-vs-west-ham-gabriel-jesus-zinchenko/bltf43c0609fad1fc7e#cs6cc8d596464c2081) after his inability to improve upon his first-half performance. Regrettably, his side could not recover after Tomas Soucek's opener, with Konstantinos Mavropanos adding salt to Arsenal's injury as the Hammers humbled the Gunners at the Emirates, per [Eurosport](https://www.eurosport.com/football/premier-league/2023-2024/arsenal-0-2-west-ham-tomas-soucek-in-the-goals-as-mikel-artetas-side-suffer-premier-league-title-set_sto9934726/story.shtml). [@sakascatIey](https://twitter.com/sakascatIey/status/1740470854243479724) called for the Ukrainian's exit from the club: \"Get Zinchenko out of my club. I'm so serious.\" [@ltarsenal](https://twitter.com/ltarsenal/status/1740480420347822104) suggested the former Man City utility player could cost Arsenal the league title: \"Zinchenko is a player who has the ability and potential to single-handedly cost you the league.\" Meanwhile, another user, [@samuelJayC](https://twitter.com/samuelJayC/status/1740479475115266555), claimed Zinchenko would have been a bench warmer if Jurrien Timber was fit: \"If Timber were fit, Zinchenko would have 0 starts.\" [@MrDtAFC](https://twitter.com/MrDtAFC/status/1740479245728755933), on the other hand, included the Ukrainian in a three-man list, who had a poor first half: \"Players are letting us down again. Trossard, Zinchenko, and Martinelli have been awful. Wake up, second half!\" Barca 'give away' points at Valencia, Atletico stumbleFootball [@Lhastim3](https://twitter.com/Lhastim3/status/1740480095599677641) lamented: \"Zinchenko can’t even do the only thing he was good at anymore.\" ➡️ [Click to join](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va8GHzX8kyyJa5gbTM40) our channel for all your favourite sports news. Earlier, Sports Brief reported that Oleksandr [Zinchenko issued a clear warning to Mykhailo](https://sportsbrief.com/football/51116-chelsea-arsenal-zinchenko-sends-warning-mykhailo-mudryk-london-derby/) Mudryk ahead of their upcoming clash in the London derby. With an implicit tone, Zinchenko hinted at the consequences Mudryk might face if he scores against Arsenal. The two players previously shared the field during Ukraine's games in the October window.",

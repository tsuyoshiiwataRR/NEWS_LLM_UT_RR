    "text": "“I’m sorry Rollies You and Your Team”: Ryan Garcia dumps Rolly Romero to declare ‘7th Fight’ with Devin Haney [](https://bit.ly/4113QfS) Follow Us Ryan Garcia, who had one of the year’s biggest fights, probably wants to kickstart the new year on a similar note. In what is being touted as one of the most significant fights in the lot of big matches lined up for 2024, he and Devin Haney are picking their way to a momentous clash. America’s Favorite Video Today But it’s not that Garcia didn’t have other options to consider. During the post-fight press conference of the Oscar Duarte fight, he called out Rolando Romero. However, as it appears from one of his tweets, seemingly, for want of an affirmative action from the WBA light welterweight champion, ‘KingRy’ took a decision to move ahead. Both Devin Haney and Ryan Garcia have known each other since their amateur days. In the six bouts they fought, it is said that they evenly distributed the victories between them. Probably they must have felt it was high time to put an end to their long-running argument in a professional arena. Providing feedback will help us make your experience better.

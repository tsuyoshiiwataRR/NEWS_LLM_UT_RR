    "text": "Ange Postecoglou blamed the tiredness of his injury-ravaged Tottenham squad after they suffered a thumping 4-2 defeat at Brighton on Thursday night. A brace of penalties from Joao Pedro and strikes from teenager Josh Hinshelwood and Pervis Estupinan gave the Seagulls a four-goal lead before a late onslaught from Postecoglou's side. Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies pulled back what seemed like consolations, only for Postecoglou's side to bombard Brighton with a flurry of shots in the closing stages. Tottenham had a host of players missing through injury and suspension, with key centre back Cristian Romero ruled out before the game for five weeks and Oliver Skipp missing out after picking up a late knock. 'We probably looked a little bit tired,' said Postecoglou. 'The lads have put in a hell of a shift over the past few weeks. Ange Postecoglou watched his side go four goals down to the Seagulls before a late fightback Tottenham suffered a miserable night on a night where their makeshift defence was exposed Your browser does not support iframes. 'We looked leggy and Brighton are always a good side. We hung in there until the end and I can't fault the effort. 'The team continue to show character. 'We lacked energy tonight - you could tell that and against Brighton that's going to cost you.

You can go to the well so many times, the way we play. The players have given everything. That's all we can ask from them.' Brighton forward Danny Welbeck said: 'It was a good performance. 'The first half was brilliant from us and we played some good football in the second half. We hurt them, we exposed their weakness.'",

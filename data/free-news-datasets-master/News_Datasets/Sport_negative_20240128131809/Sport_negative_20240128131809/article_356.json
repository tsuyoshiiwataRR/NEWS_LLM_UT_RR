    "text": "Tottenham Hotspur started their season with a bang under new coach Ange Postecoglou. Despite losing Harry Kane to Bayern Munich, They topped the table but after a string of injuries and suspensions, there was a massive drop in form. From being at the top at Game Week 10, they dropped down to 4th.\nNow they face\nBrighton and Hove Albion at the AmEx Stadium. Looking to get back into the title race, Spurs aimed for a win. The hosts meanwhile needed to take a step closer to the top 6. With the two teams playing great football, many expected a good game to spectate, but it ended up being a one-sided affair.\nTottenham were completely dominated by the hosts, who slotted four goals past Guglielmo Vicario. The scoring was opened by Josh Hinshewood in the 11th minute. Just 13 minutes later, Dejan Kulusevski pulled Danny Welbeck’s shirt in the box, which didn’t allow him to take a shot. After consulting VAR, a penalty was awarded and Joao Pedro made it 2-0.\nPervis Estupinian scored a screamer from outside the box after a corner to put Brighton 3-0 up in the 63rd minute. 12 minutes later Giovani Lo Celso conceded another penalty, which Pedro once again converted. In the last 15 minutes it looked like Spurs might’ve equalized as they managed to score two goals. Alejo Veliz and Ben Devis scored in the 81st and 85th minute, but Spurs were unable to find the back of the net.\n“Bottle Job FC is Back” – Mesut Ozil’s HILARIOUS tweet to banter Tottenham leaves internet in stitches\nFans banter Tottenham as they drop out of the top 4\nWith 4 goals conceded, Tottenham Hotspur were subjected to banter by fans. Many joked how they were going to go trophyless for the 15th season in a row, something the club was used to. Others criticized their poor performance, with captain Hueng-min Son being one of the players with a poor performance.\nCheck out some of the fans’ reactions:\nWith this loss,\nSpurs have dropped down to 5th. From being at the top, the team has collapsed due to injuries. Brighton on the other hand are now 8th, just a point behind Manchester United. Spurs will now play AFC Bournemouth, who have had a 7-game unbeaten run, while Brighton face West Ham.\nIn case you missed:\nWATCH: Real Betis officially extends Isco’s contract with HILARIOUS Ali G video “Coming for the Ballon d’Or” – Fans react to Jude Bellingham’s yet another award as he is CROWNED the best U-20 player by IFFHS Syed Talib Haider",

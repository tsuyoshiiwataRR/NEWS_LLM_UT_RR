    "text": "Dos Pueblos girls basketball was bested by powerhouse Bellevue by a score of 63-52 on Wednesday at the SoCal Holiday Prep Classic. The Chargers jumped out to an early lead thanks to some aggressive offensive play, and both teams went back and forth until the game was knotted up at 27-27 heading into halftime. The third quarter was another tight one, but Bellevue rattled off a solid run in the fourth and Dos Pueblos couldn’t recover, ultimately falling 63-52. “It was a great test and challenge for us,” Chargers coach Manny Murillo said. “Turnovers and indecisiveness played a role in our loss. I could have done better with my adjustments and rotations.” Justine Katz was the lone Charger in double figures with 13 points. Taylor Grant followed with nine points while Lia Papador and Eden Wynne each added seven points. “Lia Papador was a major spark for us and kept us in the game,” Murillo said. “She is getting into her flow approaching the mid-season mark.” Dos Pueblos is now 9-3 on the season and will continue play at the SoCal Holiday Prep Classic on Thursday.",

    "text": "An ex-NFL star blasted the theory that Taylor Swift has only been distracting Travis Kelce and his team, the Kansas City Chiefs. The Kansas City Chiefs tasted five losses out of the team's eight games this season, with the game against the Las Vegas Raiders on Christmas Day as the latest defeat. Swift, at that time, watched her beau play on the field again, and she was blasted for allegedly distracting the whole team instead of bringing something positive to them. Taylor Swift Is Not a Distraction, Ex-NFL Star Says Ex-NFL star Merril Hoge spoke to OutKick (via [The Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/american-sports/taylor-swift-zero-travis-kelce-31757431?utm_source=mynewsassistant.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=embedded_search_item_mobile)) to comment on the spreading bizarre theory about Swift being a distraction to the Kansas City Chiefs. Aside from the latest game, the \"Lavender Haze\" singer was also present when the team lost against Green Bay Packers and Buffalo Bills. \"It's irrelevant,\" he said. \"That's a media twist. That's actually just to tell you how weak and stupid the media is and people are. It has nothing to do with the locker room. They've never been in the locker room, and they (the media) clearly don't understand the National Football League, the dynamics of winning on Sundays when you win, when you lose, the struggles that exist.\" Hoge added, \"Somebody who sings songs has zero to do with it.\" READ ALSO: [Daddy's Girl: Taylor Swift's Father Is Having 'Difficult Moment' Amid Engagement Rumors ](https://www.musictimes.com/articles/98803/20231218/daddys-girl-taylor-swifts-father-having-difficult-moment-amid-engagement.htm) The former Pittsburgh Steelers running back also applauded Swift's \"greatness and brilliance\" which led her to have the most successful albums. Thus, he reiterated that the singer has nothing to do with where the Kansas City Chiefs team is right now. His comment came after Fox Sports analyst Skip Bayless shared his thoughts about Swift's effect on the Kansas City Chiefs players' performance. \"Feels like it's about time to call Taylor Swift a distraction,\" he said. \"What do you think, Patrick? Andy? How about you, Travis?\" Meanwhile, Kelce has since broken his silence on the \"embarrassing\" defeat, saying they played offense while putting the defense higher and still did not see things go their way. Despite the recent label, Swift and Kelce showed off their budding romance in public by going out of the stadium hand-in-hand. Kansas City Star photojournalist Nick Wagner shared a [photo of the moment](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1S9tdRNlB-/), causing fans' hearts to skip a beat.

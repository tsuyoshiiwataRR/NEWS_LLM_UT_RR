    "text": "With its best five players in Brooklyn Wednesday night, the Long Island Nets had a limited roster to face the Wisconsin Herd and lost, 114-82, at Nassau Coliseum. The Nets three two-ways, Jalen Wilson (21), Armoni Brooks (12) and Keon Johnson (12,) combined for 45 points while Brooklyn’s two first round picks, Noah Clowney (14) and Dariq Whitehead (2) combined for 16. But back in Uniondale, the G League Nets got hammered, their roster falling to nine players after the NBA Nets called everyone up to play the Herd’s parent club, the [Milwaukee Bucks](https://www.brewhoop.com). Long Island was led by Nets guard Kyler Edwards as he posted 17 points, one rebound, two assists and five steals in 37 minutes. Long Island guard Kennedy Chandler notched 16 points, five rebounds, six assists and one steal in 32 minutes. Nets forward Jordan Hall recorded 15 points, three rebounds, three assists and one steal in 30 minutes. The two teams got off to an even start in the first quarter, until consecutive dunks by Wisconsin forward — and one-time Brooklyn big — Wenyen Gabriel allowed the Herd to sneak past the Nets. Long Island closed the period down by 10, 29-19. Long Island worked hard to close the gap in the second quarter, but Wisconsin’s defense created some difficulty for the Nets. The Herd kept their lead and went into halftime ahead by 15, 60-45. Wisconsin outscored Long Island 23-18 in the third quarter while outrebounding the Nets 16-10. The Herd went into the final period ahead by 20, 83-63. Long Island struggled to string baskets together in the fourth quarter, as the Herd continued to outscore the Nets 31-19 in the period. Wisconsin went on to defeat Long Island by 32, 114-82. Gabriel recorded a double-double with 21 points and 14 rebounds to go along with two assists and one block in 28 minutes. Herd forward Elijah Hughes tallied 17 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block in 27 minutes. Long Island will travel to Cleveland to face the Charge on Friday, at 7:00 p.m. ET. All five of the call-ups — the three two-ways and the two first round picks — will be in Ohio with Long Island.",

    "text": "Competing in the decathlon, in which I won gold at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics, I have seen performances from some inspiring women. But the truth is that no matter how hard they trained, they would never have been able to match my times (apart from the 1,500 meter race, where some women were able to beat me). My physique was too different, too masculine. It would have been tremendously unfair for me to compete against them. My victory would have been a farce. So when I see trans women like American swimmer Lia Thomas or Canadian cyclist Veronica Ivy (formerly known as Rachel McKinnon) on the podium, I know they are biologically male and the physical advantage has helped them win. All my sporting instincts rebel against that. For sport to mean anything, it must be fair. Women’s 100 meters final of the 19th Asian Games at Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Stadium on September 30, 2023 Lia Thomas during a swimming competition on the University of Pennsylvania campus in 2019 That’s why we need clarity, like that offered by Boris Johnson, who said: ‘I don’t think biological men should compete in women’s sporting events. Maybe it’s a bit controversial to say, but it makes sense to me. “I also think that women should have spaces – whether in hospitals, prisons or locker rooms – dedicated to them.” I, too, am strongly opposed to allowing trans women to participate in women’s sports. I don’t consider this controversial or political. It’s about justice. Trans athletes say they do everything they can to compete fairly, for example by taking testosterone blockers. Let’s put aside the fact that I have strong reservations about the use of any hormone-disrupting drug in sport. But it seems glaringly obvious that no pill can eliminate the benefits that come from growing biologically like men in terms of muscular and skeletal strength. These trans women have gone through male puberty. They have longer limbs, broader shoulders, thicker bones, better power-to-weight ratios, and larger heart and blood volumes. Nothing they can do will change that: they will always outperform biological women. Canadian cyclist Rachel McKinnon warms up before competing at the 2019 UCI Track Cycling Masters World Championships in Manchester This is an issue I’ve seen grow from a minor concern to a national controversy in sports – and beyond – although, in recent months, it seems as if something is changing. My opinion is that the sport should have a women’s section and a new, open class where transgender women would be welcome and could compete fairly. There should be space for trans women in sport, but not at the expense of all women. Like any decent human being, I fully support everyone’s right to present themselves however they want, use whatever name and pronouns they feel reflect their true self, and live their lives however they wish. It is sad that equal rights for transgender people have been suppressed for so long. Over the past 20 years, we have seen the rise of a more compassionate society, but the unintended consequence is injustice towards women. And getting rid of outdated gender stereotypes should not result in biologically male predators – who identify as women – having access to women’s prisons or domestic violence shelters. Women have fought hard to achieve their safe spaces. You have to respect them. I have spoken increasingly openly about this on social media and people who attend my gym in Putney, south-west London, have started to ask me about it. How can a young woman feel inspired to play sports if she knows she will compete (and lose) against biological men? And how can a father feel that his daughter is safe in a locker room where biologically intact male athletes dress and shower next to her? Sir Keir Starmer, leader of the Labor Party, found himself unable to say what a woman is. Is not difficult; When in doubt, ask any five-year-old. I’m not interested in partisan politics. I am not surprised, however, that Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens are questioned by voters when they lack the courage to state simple biological facts. Some of my good friends, including Czech-American tennis star Martina Navratilova and record-breaking British competitive swimmer Sharron Davies, have done so and, as a result, have received shocking abuse from trans extremists. I want everyone to know that I am by their side. I have also been horrified by the violent threats directed at the novelist JK Rowling, who has spoken of nothing but serene common sense. Does that make me a feminist? Well, no one has ever called me that, but there is a first time for everything. What I do know is that I am not transphobic or misogynist, two insults that have been thrown at me on Twitter. If we are afraid to tell the truth, we are really in trouble. And if trans women are allowed to compete in women’s categories, then women’s sport is not only in trouble: it is finished.",

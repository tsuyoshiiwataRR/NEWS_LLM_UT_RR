    "text": "Former NBA player Chandler Parsons was critical of Ja Morant's controversial celebration after hitting an alley-oop against the New Orleans Pelicans. Morant was playing in only his fourth game back after returning from a 25-game suspension and 'It's ridiculous,' Parsons said on FanDuel TV's 'Run It Back' show. 'You gotta grow up. Why are we talking about this? Your team is 4-0 [since Morant's return.] You've been unbelievable.' 'You've now been probably forgiven to a certain point, especially in Memphis, right? The team is back to being yours. You're playing at an elite level. Why are you giving us anything like this to even talk about, to discuss, that's negative?' 'Why is your father [Tee Morant] doing interviews talking about how you didn't make any changes in your personal life and your issues, sitting courtside with his hood and glasses on.' Ex-NBA player Chandler Parsons was critical of Ja Morant's celebration against the Pelicans Morant performed the controversial celebration after hitting an alley-oop against New Orleans Many X users including Morant have noted the celebration to be a dance from New Orleans Ja Morant pulled out that BR cell https://t.co/IF5379EDg9 pic.twitter.com/25Kdw6u8hE LSU's football team has been seen doing the dance multiple times after scoring touchdowns Many social media users - including Morant - have noted that 24-year-old's celebration that Parsons and other critics have incorrectly tried to brand as a gun celebration was in fact a popular dance from New Orleans, that was being performed against a New Orleans team. LSU's football team - most notably potential first-round NFL draft pick Malik Nabers - has gone viral on multiple occasions for doing the dance to celebrate touchdowns. 'What else has to happen for you and your family and your friends to learn? Just make this about basketball, make this about your life, make this about your livelihood, and stop doing things like this because you're must-see TV on the court, Parsons continued. 'Aside from Anthony Edwards, you are my favorite player to watch. Don't give us any of this other bull***t to talk about. Just be a star.' Since returning from his suspension, Morant has played like a star with an average of 28.8 points and 8.5 assists in his four games this season. Parsons has not played in the NBA since the 2019-20 when he appeared in only five games for the Houston Rockets. During those five appearances he played in less than 11 minutes per game and averaged only 2.8 points per game.",

    "text": "LLOR BLIMEY Tottenham legend Hugo Lloris closing in on transfer exit after being axed as captain by Ange Postecoglou Frenchman has not featured in a matchday squad under Ange Postecoglou Posted Friday, December 29, 2023 by Thesun.co.uk HUGO LLORIS is in advanced talks over a move to MLS outfit Los Angeles FC. The former France captain, who turned 37 on Boxing Day, has been at Tottenham for 11 years. Hugo Lloris is set to leave Tottenham after over a decade in North London Credit: PA But he has not featured at all this season following the signing of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario from Empoli in June. He had options to leave in the summer but snubbed interest from Lazio, Newcastle, former club Nice and Saudi Arabia. Yet Lloris looks close to ending his stay in North London by moving Stateside to LAFC, the club where former Spurs team-mate Gareth Bale finished his career. Lloris’s deal is up in the summer but him moving now would be a boost to Tottenham’s wage kitty as he is on more than £100,000 a week. He racked up a whopping 447 appearances for Spurs although sadly his last one was the infamous 6-1 defeat at Newcastle in April, when he came off injured at half-time having shipped five goals. Injury-hit Spurs will lose captain Son Heung-min to the Asian Cup next month as well as midfielders Yves Bissouma and Pape Sarr to the African Cup of Nations. Yet more players could still leave with Eric Dier regularly overlooked by boss Ange Postecoglou, who has prioritised signing a new centre-back in January. Pierre Emile-Hojbjerg could also leave having fallen down the pecking order under Postecoglou, but would likely be replaced Postecoglou recently heaped praise upon Lloris, saying: \"[His future] is not my decision. It’s a decision for Hugo and the club. I don’t have that power and don’t want that power. \"Hugo is a member of this squad and how he trains every day is important to me. If he wasn’t then I’d be dealing with it but I haven’t had to, he has been absolutely first-class. “As a manager, I don’t take that for granted because that could be a problem for me. For most managers, it is the ones who aren’t playing who give you the biggest headaches. It’s his decision to make.\" Photos [More»](/photo/) Thursday December 28 2023 [[PICTURE SPECIAL] Everton 1 - 3 Man City](/photo/data/20231228/15579.shtml) Thursday December 28 2023 [[PICTURE SPECIAL] Chelsea FC 2 - 1 Crystal Palace](/photo/data/20231228/15578.shtml) Wednesday December 27 2023 [Seven Man Utd stars at risk of axe after Sir Jim Ratcliffe takeover](/photo/data/20231227/15577.shtml) Your Say [More »](#)",

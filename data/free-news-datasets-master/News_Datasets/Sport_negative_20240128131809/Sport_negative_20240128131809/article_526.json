    "text": "PETALING JAYA: Mixed doubles shuttler Cheah Yee See is set to follow her partner Chan Peng Soon and hang up her racquet next year.\nThe 28-year-old Yee See plans to compete for the last time in the Malaysian Masters in May with Peng Soon, 35.\n“I plan to retire from the sport together with Peng Soon after the Malaysian Masters,” said Yee See.\n“I have tried my best in competitions for so many years and honestly, I’m feeling tired and I believe it’s time for me to pursue another career.\n“We have chosen the Malaysian tourney as our last outing together as we want to end our playing careers in front of our home fans.”\nYee See first combined with Peng Soon in 2017 for a brief spell while both were still in the Badminton Association of Malaysia. They split up and Yee See partnered Hoo Pang Ron.\nPang Ron-Yee See played together for around five years before they parted ways last year after not managing to reach a higher level.\nYee See then reunited with Peng Soon and the duo left BAM at the end of last year to turn independent.\nThe pair’s best achievement was winning the lower-ranked KL Masters in Titiwangsa last month.\nYee See also won the Russian Open in 2017 with Peng Soon.\nWith Pang Ron, she had triumphed in the Hyderabad Open in India in 2019 and won silver in the 2022 SEA Games in Vietnam.\nYee See is now looking forward to ending her career on a high note with Peng Soon.\nThey will compete in the Malaysian Open from Jan 9-14 for the last time after they were promoted from the reserve list.\n“I’m thankful to get the opportunity to play in the Malaysian Open for one last time,” said Yee See.\n“I want to go all out in front of the home fans but at the same time I want to enjoy myself on court.”\nWorld No. 41 Peng Soon-Yee See will open their campaign at home against Taiwan’s world No. 35 Chang Ko-chi-Lee Chih-chen.\nOpen Modal ×",

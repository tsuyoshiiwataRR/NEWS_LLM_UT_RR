    "text": "STRASBURG — Area girls basketball teams struggled on the opening day of the Ram Hardwood Classic on Wednesday.\nOnly Central was able to advance to the semifinals, while Skyline, Sherando and previously unbeaten Strasburg lost in the quarterfinals.\nCentral 64, East Rockingham 59\nThe Falcons were a little up and down but held off a solid Eagles’ squad. Central senior Makenna Painter scored her 1,000th career point in the first quarter. Her basket capped off an 8-0 run and gave Central a 13-4 lead.\nHowever, East Rockingham did not go away. The Falcons never trailed in the contest, but the Eagles used a 7-0 run in the fourth quarter to cut the deficit to 54-49 with 4:03 left.\n“I think we had spurts where we were playing good, we were playing as a team,” Central girls basketball coach Ashleigh Fletcher said. “And I think there were sometimes where we weren’t. And we were just playing a little bit reserved and kind of lazy. And I don’t know if it’s that we got tired or what we were expecting, but I think it definitely could have gone better.”\nCentral responded with a layup from Aamori Williams and three points from Makenna Painter to take a 60-52 lead with 1:50 remaining. East Rockingham once again battled back. The Eagles used a 6-1 run to cut the lead to 61-58 with 1:43 left.\nCentral was able to put the game away with a combined three free throws from Peyton DiNardo and Williams.\n“I feel like we could always play better, but it wasn’t a bad game at all,” Painter said. “We can grow on it.”\nPainter had 21 points and 14 rebounds for the Falcons. Kynli Hoover had 13 points and three steals, and Williams had 9 points, five rebounds and four assists.\nThe Falcons (6-1, 1-1 Bull Run) play Page County in Thursday’s semifinals.\nBuffalo Gap 45, Strasburg 42\nThe Rams suffered their first loss of the season in a defeat to the Bison. Buffalo Gap used a big second-quarter run to take the lead and held on from there.\n“We didn’t play our basketball,” Strasburg girls basketball coach Kelly Stinnette said. “We came out very flat. We came out inpatient. We didn’t play our defense. We didn’t box out. We did not play good basketball tonight. We played a little bit better in the second half, but it still wasn’t us.”\nWith the game tied 17-17, Buffalo Gap went on a 9-0 run to end the second quarter. The Bison eventually stretched the lead to as many as 11 points, but the Rams fought back in the fourth quarter.\nStrasburg used a 7-0 run late in the game to cut the lead to 43-42 with 1:27 left. Strasburg’s Macy Smith had a steal and a basket, Emily Gorrell hit a driving layup and Jayden Stinnette hit a 3-pointer to cap off the spurt.\nThe Rams caused seven Buffalo Gap turnovers in the fourth quarter, but over the last 1:27 Strasburg had two turnovers and missed four shots as the Bison sealed the win. Buffalo Gap’s Avery Bradley and Bailey Talley each made a free throw to seal the victory.\n“We’ve got to bounce back (Thursday),” Kelly Stinnette said. “That’s what we just got done talking about was there’s no feeling sorry for ourselves, it didn’t come down to one play, it’s a cycle of plays. And they outplayed us today.”\nSmith led the Rams with 24 points, five rebounds and four steals. Gorrell had 8 points, and Jayden Stinnette 7 points for Strasburg.\nThe Rams (7-1, 2-0 Bull Run) play Sherando on Thursday.\nPage County 63, Skyline 47\nThe Hawks put up a fight, but came up short to the Panthers. Skyline took an early 9-2 lead with a field goal each from Lyzie Scriva, Taliyah Vanryck Degroot and Elaine Breeden and a 3-pointer by Aysia Payton.\nHowever, the Panthers used an 11-0 run to take the lead for good. Page County outscored Skyline 20-9 to grab a 27-18 halftime lead. The Hawks used an 11-2 run to start the fourth quarter to cut the lead to 47-41 with 5:37 left.\nScriva, Samya Whitmore and Audrey Lacombe each hit a 3-pointer during the run. Page County responded with a 10-2 run to put the game out of reach.\nSkyline was led by Scriva with 16 points and Lacombe with 8 points.\nThe Hawks (2-7, 2-2 Class 3 Northwestern) play East Rockingham on Thursday.\nBroadway 40, Sherando 33\nThe Warriors went toe-to-toe with the Gobblers but came up short down the stretch in a low-scoring contest.\nSherando took an early 7-2 lead, led by a 3-pointer from Josie Willett, a driving layup by Farren Crist and a basket by Paige McKee. Sherando led the entire first half, holding a 13-12 halftime edge.\nBroadway took its first lead of the game to start the third quarter and led most of the second half. The Warriors used a 7-2 run to tie the game on a Willett 3-pointer with 4:20 left.\nBroadway’s Wren Wheeler hit a 3-pointer with 3:25 left to give the Gobblers a 31-28 edge, and they led the rest of the way.\nWheeler hit back-to-back baskets to key a 12-3 run to seal the win.\n“I thought our effort was there,” Sherando girls basketball coach Brooklyn Wilson said. “I was very pleased with how hard the girls fought. Unfortunately, we had a couple lapses mentally at really crucial points in the game. I feel like maybe 90 percent of the time we executed well, but that 10 percent just came always at the wrong time. So we have to do a better job of being more focused and locked in throughout the whole game.”\nSherando was playing without senior Asia Williams due to injury, and Wilson said she was happy with how the other players stepped up.\n“I thought the other girls did a nice job of handling the ball and doing a good job,” Wilson said. “She’s one of our top defenders, so other people stepped up in that aspect as well. We certainly miss having her out there, and we’ll be happy when she’s back, but I think the other kids did a really nice job of stepping up and filling that role.”\nWillett had 12 points, and Crist had 11 points to lead Sherando.\nThe Warriors play Strasburg on Thursday.",

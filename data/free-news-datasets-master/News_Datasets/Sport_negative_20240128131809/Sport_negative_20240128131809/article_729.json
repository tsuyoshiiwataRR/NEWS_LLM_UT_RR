    "text": "A “challenging” year has ended with further problems for the local basketball federation. It was revealed in a press release on Wednesday that the Jason Hill led National Basketball Federation of Trinidad and Tobago (NBFTT) has been sanctioned by the world governing body for the sport, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). While the details of the sanctions were not revealed, the Express understands T&T will be ineligible to participate in the next edition of the FIBA 3x3 World Cup in 2025. The NBFTT media release on Wednesday stated that the sanction was as a result of the NBFTT’s failure to attend the 3x3 FIBA World Cup qualifiers and pay the AmeriCup 3x3 Basketball registration fee. “…The NBFTT has been sanctioned and FIBA has asked the NBFTT to explain what happened. The NBFTT is awaiting FIBA’s response. However, this situation is only with regard to 3x3 basketball programme,” the media release stated. The NBFTT also laid the blame for its troubles in 2023 on “administrative challenges” which the new NBFTT board, which was elected in January 2023, had to overcome. “The year 2023 has proven to be a very challenging year for basketball because of the state that the new Board met the sport in, following the January 14, 2023 Annual General Meeting and the election of officers,” the NBFTT stated. Among the challenges faced was that, “the new Board had no documents to meet the requirements for funding as stipulated by the Sport Company on Trinidad and Tobago, and the Ministry of Sport and Community Development to fund several projects, one of which was the FIBA 3x3 World Cup qualifiers and the 2023 FIBA AmeriCup tournament.” However, the Federation further stated that, “despite all the challenges faced for the last 12 months, the NBFTT ensured that basketball was present at the Central America and Caribbean (CAC) Games in El Salvador in June, with players - Nayton Lewis, Chike Augustine, Tyrese Fields and Ahkeem Boyd under the guidance of coach Milan Stamenkovic and manager Wayne Samuel.” T&T won a historic bronze medal at the Pan American Games in October. Additionally, the NBFTT said it had assembled a coaching staff that comprised T&T’s two-time WNBA player and former national assistant coach Pietra Gay, who is FIBA qualified, and Atiba DeLeon to prepare the team. “This Board has proved what can be achieved with teamwork and bringing together our talent and experience,” the release added. Moriba De Freitas captained the 3x3 Pan Am team and was credited with the assist that led to Ahkeem Boyd’s two-pointer at the death that sealed the medal. Looking to the new year, the NBFTT stated its focus for 2024, “will be to ensure that its strategic plan takes full effect with the revival of our zones and a return to 5 vs 5 basketball as has been the case with the South Zone which jumped off its 2023/2024 season on December 2, with competition in the First Division and Under-21 age group.”",

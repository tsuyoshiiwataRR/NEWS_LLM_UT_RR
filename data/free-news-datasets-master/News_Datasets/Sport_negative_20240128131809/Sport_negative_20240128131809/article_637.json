    "text": "Mario Cristobal, who has now coached at two college football juggernauts in Oregon and Miami, has yet to attend the school of clock management. The Hurricanes of Miami fell to Rutgers 31-24 in the Pinstripe Bowl on Thursday afternoon. It was yet another ugly season from Cristobal's squad, but he needs to take a majority of the blame. Cristobal has made a number of mind-boggling decisions as a head coach over the years, and those decisions mostly have to do with the clock. Those issues reappeared during Thursday's Pinstripe Bowl. Trailing 28-17 and facing a fourth and two near midfield with just over nine minutes left in the final quarter, Cristobal called a dive up the gut, which was stuffed. Rutgers then drained about seven minutes off the clock before tacking on a field goal to make it a two-score game with two and a half minutes left. Miami proceeded to score a touchdown to make it a one-score game on its following drive. However, they didn't use a single timeout and two whole minutes were drained from the game clock as a result. That forced the Hurricanes to attempt an onside kick, which Rutgers recovered, because there were just 27 seconds left in the game. \"Unreal Miami 4-2. Lots of time. Own 40. Up the gut. Gets stuffed. GT game. Take a knee. Decisions by a HC are so big. Miami ends up 7-6,\" said Jim Leavitt, who was reportedly in the running to be Oregon's head coach after Willie Taggart left for Florida State, but was passed over by then-Ducks offensive line coach Mario Cristobal. \"Wait ... so you're telling me Mario Cristobal is having some problems managing the clock? I'm stunned,\" said Barrett Sallee. \"Cristobal going home with 2 timeouts in his pocket. Also mismanaged clock at end of 1H. Incredible,\" said a fan. \"Maybe if Cristobal managed the clock better, that onside kick recovery would have actually mattered He didnâ€™t even use 2 of his timeouts,\" one fan wrote. \"Mario Cristobal, the worst clock/game manager I've ever seen, just butchered the clock again. Down 31-17 with 2:35 left & 2 TO's, they don't use either of them, casually go down the field with no sense of urgency & score with :27 left. #clockmanagement ,\" one fan wrote. Mario Cristobal needs to learn his lesson, but it's incredibly likely he never will. Year three will prove pivotal in Cristobal's career at Miami.",

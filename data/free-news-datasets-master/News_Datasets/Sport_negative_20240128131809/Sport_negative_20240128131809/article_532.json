    "text": "While many college football fans are tuning into College Football Playoff coverage to see who might have the advantage in either of the two semifinal games, others are watching to hopefully get a clue into the future of one of the coaches leading a playoff team. Jim Harbaugh is no stranger to flirting with a possible exit from Michigan to head to the NFL, and once again, rumors are swirling. Fox college football analyst Joel Klatt says these rumors are already looming over Michigan’s game against No. 4 Alabama in the Rose Bowl. “He was successful at every level he’s been at. He was successful in the National Football League, he’s been successful now in college, and he’s going to be the number one candidate on any NFL coaching search,” Klatt said on Thursday’s episode of The Joel Klatt Show. Reports recently revealed the Wolverines have a ten-year extension worth $125 million on the table for Harbaugh. One of the big hurdles is a stipulation that he won’t seek an NFL job in the 2024 cycle. With all the current prime NFL openings and potential NCAA penalties in the coming years, this could be why Michigan has yet to secure its head coach’s signatures. “So now that’s looming over this game. He’s in L.A. to play the Rose Bowl against Alabama and everyone’s going to be thinking about the Chargers. Is he going to be the Chargers next head coach? Why hasn’t he signed the extension with Michigan if it’s $125 million? Can he get $20 million [per year] to go to the National Football League?” Klatt said. Harbaugh dodged questions about his college football coaching future while speaking to members of the media on Wednesday while on a team bonding trip to Disney Land. We’ll likely have to wait until after Jan. 1 when the No. 1 Michigan Wolverines and No. 4 Alabama Crimson Tide kickoff in the Rose Bowl at 5:00 p.m. ET on ESPN.",

    "text": "2023-12-29 01:25:56 This Thursday the relegation of Colón de Santa Fe to the Primera Nacional was ratified. The AFA Disciplinary Court did not give rise to the club’s request where it requested the elimination of the loss of category by annual table. This Friday it will issue its resolution in the Official Gazette. Given this decision, the Santa Fe team, Like Arsenal, they are both relegated and they will play in the second category of Argentine soccer in 2024. On December 6, after losing 1 to 0 against Gimnasia, Colón made a presentation, through his lawyer, requesting the annulment of the relegation. «In mid-2023, the AFA Assembly decided to modify article 90 of the Statute and therefore the demotions, eliminating one of the relegations. This occurred with the season already underway. (…) This new system adopted once the season “was already underway, is openly illegitimate and violates the guarantees of legal and sporting equality.”the writing began. «A playoff match played on the basis of a regulation altered in the middle of the competition without the approval of all members of the Executive Committee cannot be admitted. The modifications of the June 2023 Assembly without the approval of all the members of the Committee, should in any case have been in force for the 2024 season,” completed the Sabalera entity headed at that time by José Vignatti. After two weeks of waiting, the disciplinary body decided to ratify the loss of category and will announce it in the next few hours.

This would avoid high costs of transferring delegations. Source: Argentine News 1703814137 #AFA #Disciplinary #Court #confirmed #Colóns #relegation #National",

    "text": "The Dallas Cowboys lost another game on the road this season after a 22-20 loss to the Miami Dolphins in Week 16.\nAll five of the Cowboys‚Äô losses this season have come away from home, which does not bode well for their postseason hopes unless they win the NFC East.\nSo while Dallas has the second-best scoring offense in the NFL, the team can‚Äôt seem to win when it matters most.\nAnd that situation has befuddled NFL analyst and unabashed Cowboys fan Skip Bayless, who spoke about Dallas‚Äô strange season on his podcast this week.\n‚ÄúAllow me to psychoanalyze the strangest Dallas Cowboys team I‚Äôve ever encountered,‚Äù Bayless said. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ I love this team. I hate this team. I refuse to give up completely on this team because I still believe it can and will do great things this year, this season, as long as everyone gives completely up on this team.‚Äù\nA new episode is out now!!\n[@RealSkipBayless]answers whether this is a bad Cowboys team or just one that can't win on the road ü§î\nListen here:\n [pic.twitter.com/2qDBJcXsmP]\n‚Äî The Skip Bayless Show (@SkipBaylessShow)\n[December 28, 2023]\nThe Cowboys actually matched the Dolphins‚Äô No. 1 ranked offense stride for stride for most of the game and led by one point with 3:33 left in the game.\nIt was the defense this time that failed them after it allowed Miami to storm down the field on a 64-yard drive to kick the game-winning 29-yard field goal.\nThis was a different team, too, that was blown out by the Buffalo Bills in Week 15.\nDak Prescott threw two touchdowns on 20-of-32 attempts and the defense limited the Dolphins to just one offensive touchdown.\nBut for some reason, when it mattered most, the Cowboys couldn‚Äôt muster a win.\nAnd at 10-5, that might cost them a home playoff game unless something breaks right for Dallas in the final two weeks.\nNEXT: Skip Bayless Believes 1 NFL Team's Problems Are 'Not Fixable'",

    "text": "The\nChicago Bears are looking to continue their winning streak when they take on the Atlanta Falcons in Week 17. However, that task would become much more difficult for the Bears if Justin Fields didn't have two of his best weapons to throw to.\nBoth Cole Kmet and\nDarnell Mooney missed practice for a second straight day on Thursday, via Adam Hoge of CHGO. Kmet is dealing with a knee injury while Mooney has a concussion.\nKmet entered Week 16 banged up with a quad injury. While he managed to play through it, he suffered a knee injury that took him out of the contest. Back-to-back missed practices do not bode well for the right end's chances of suiting up against the Falcons.\nThe same can be said for Mooney. After reporting concussion-like symptoms on Monday, the wide receiver has been unable to return to practice. He'll need to pass the league's concussion protocol if he wants to play in Week 17.\nWith DJ Moore in town, Mooney hasn't been a focal point of the Bears' pass attack. Still his 31 receptions and 414 yards rank third the team. Right behind Kmet, whose 70 catches for 678 yards and six touchdowns sit just behind Moore for the team lead. Signed to a long-term extension, Kmet has become a staple of the passing game.\nNo matter how big their roles are, Cole Kmet and Darnell Mooney are still keep pass-catchers for Justin Fields. If one or both aren't able to play in Week 17, it could be difficult for Chicago to take down Atlanta and win their second straight game.",

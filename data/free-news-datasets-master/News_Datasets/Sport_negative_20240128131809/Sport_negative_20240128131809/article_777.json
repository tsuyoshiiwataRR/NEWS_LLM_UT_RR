    "text": "Ryan Ramczyk's professional football career is in jeopardy. He was diagnosed with a cartilage defect in his knee which could be career-threartening. The [New Orleans Saints](/nfl/new-orleans-saints) tackle knew that this would cast a shadow of doubt in his hopes of having a long NFL tenure. This prompted him to keep thinking about his future. If he does choose to retire, a final showdown against Taylor Heinicke's Atlanta Falcons awaits him. There has [not been any decision](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39199666/saints-ryan-ramczyk-uncertain-nfl-future-due-cartilage-defect) to come [out of Ryan Ramczyk](https://clutchpoints.com/saints-news-all-pro-tackle-ryan-ramczyk-gets-96-million-extension) but he has unveiled his thoughts on it, via Katherine Terrell of ESPN. “I feel like I'm not done yet. I feel like I still want to play and feel like I'm still passionate about the game. When you think about it like that, my mind frame is, ‘I want to play, and I want to keep doing it, so what can I do to get better, to not have this happen in-season?,'” was the [revelation that the Saints](https://clutchpoints.com/saints-most-blame-week-16-loss-vs-rams) left tackle made amid his injury struggles. These wishes for a longer career look bleak for the Saints' big man. He faces a future filled with knee issues because of the injury. If he spends more time on the gridiron, the situation could get worse. Moreover, a realization hit him this season. After battling with this pain for the past years, all he could say was, “This year it's bugged me a little bit more than it has in the past. At some point, I just couldn't play anymore.” Will he end his tenure and career during the Saints' game against Taylor Heinicke's Falcons?",

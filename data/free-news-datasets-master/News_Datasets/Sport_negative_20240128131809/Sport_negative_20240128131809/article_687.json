    "text": "Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts pitches the ball to tight end Dallas Goedert during the first half of an NFL football game against the Seattle Seahawks, Monday, Dec. 18, 2023, in Seattle.\nPHILADELPHIA − There’s nothing wrong with being a perfectionist.\nAnd certainly, that trait is welcomed among players who always feel they can get better. Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, for example, often says, “There’s never an arrival.”\nYet being in the locker room Monday night, you would think the Eagles had lost to the Giants rather than beating them 33-25. Wide receiver A.J. Brown refused to talk to the media, saying, “I’ve got nothing nice to say.”\nFellow wide receiver DeVonta Smith said, “I’m not happy.”\nHere’s a photo gallery from the game:\nThen Hurts and Jason Kelce had what appeared to be a serious conversation at Hurts’ locker for about 10-15 minutes.\nWelcome to the “Eye on the Eagles” newsletter. It sure seems like the Eagles are a bunch of angry birds 😠 🦅, even though they could conceivably clinch the NFC East title this weekend if the Cowboys lose Saturday against Detroit (11-4) while the Eagles beat Arizona (3-12) on Sunday.\nThat 🐦Cardinals game also marks the return of former Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon, who left under some interesting circumstances two days after the Super Bowl. The Cardinals admitted to tampering by contacting him a few days before the game, a dead period for coaches whose teams were playing that weekend\nThe Eagles are also in the running for the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs.\nCHANCE FOR THE HALL: Ex-Eagles cornerback Eric Allen among 15 finalists for NFL Hall of Fame’s Class of 2024\nAnyway, I asked Hurts on Wednesday about the locker room talks, in addition to the sideline confrontation when head coach Nick Sirianni yelled something at defensive line coach Jeremiah Washburn and Smith, with Brown in the background.\n“Very observant of you,” Hurts said (Hey, what can I say?).\n“Those are conversations that happen every game,” he continued. “The things that you don’t see. Sometimes people don’t know what they don’t know. But in terms of constant pursuit of excellence and playing to the level we want to play to, it takes all 11. It takes great communication. It takes great leadership. So those conversations go on, just for the betterment of us as a team, talking about what we saw, and how we can continue to move forward.”\nAnd what about the perception that Hurts can’t enjoy a victory? Sure, the win over the going-nowhere Giants was closer than it should have been after the Eagles gifted New York two touchdowns on a special teams fumble and a pick-6 when Dallas Goedert fell down.\nStill, it was a win, and it ended the Eagles’ three-game losing streak.\n“Everyone has their own preconceived notion on something,” Hurts said. “I know I personally havee been looked at like that for a long time because there’s value in losing. That does something to you. As a competitor, it drives you and pushes you forward. You don’t want to feel those feelings you felt when you came up short in situations. Every competitor is different. Every competitor handles and channels different emotions in different ways. And so, how we channel that as a team, as long as we’re doing that together, as long as we’re on the same page, that’s all that matters.”\nLook, Hurts is the quarterback that he is, with a 28-4 record since 2021, because he is always striving to get better. Smith said he’s the same way.\n“That’s just how I am,” he said. “We’re not going to always get by, doing the things that we’re doing. Yeah, we’re 11-4, but been barely getting by. That don’t last forever.”\nThere is only one game left after the New Year’s Eve 🎉ball drops Sunday night in New York City’s Times Square before the playoffs begin. Maybe the Eagles can start having fun again in 2024.\nFollow me on social media Feel free to reach out to me, either via email at [email protected] , or on X (formerly known as Twitter): @Mfranknfl.\nBut mostly, thanks for being a loyal reader, and hopefully, a subscriber.\nAnd Happy Holidays!\nHere are some of my favorite stories from the past week:\nThis article originally appeared on Delaware News Journal: Why isn’t Jalen Hurts, or anyone else, having any fun?",

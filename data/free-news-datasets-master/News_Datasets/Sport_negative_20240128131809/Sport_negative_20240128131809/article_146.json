    "text": "The\nCleveland Browns have had a long history of terrible QB play, seeing a constant carousel under center in most seasons dating back to the turn of the century.\nThursday night, fans will have a chance to put those bad memories behind them and look to ahead to the future.\nTeam sponsor\nDUDE Wipes is offering an awesome opportunity ahead of the Cleveland‚Äôs Thursday Night Football matchup against the Jets.\nBefore kickoff, Browns fans can swap their past quarterback jerseys for a brand new one.\nTo celebrate amazing\n[@browns]QB play this season and our presenting sponsorship of the team‚Äôs white unis, fans can bring an old jersey of any Browns QB from ‚Äô99-‚Äô21 and we‚Äôll swap it out for a new white jersey at the stadium ahead of TNF. DUDE Wipes loves your Browns! [pic.twitter.com/mpNOGllmjo]\n‚Äî DUDE Wipes (@DUDEwipes)\n[December 27, 2023]\nThe post notes that QB jerseys from the 1999 season through the 2021 campaign will be accepted.\nThat should lend plenty of options.\nWe‚Äôve all seen the jerseys containing a long list of tape on the back as fans cross out the passer from the year prior and replace with the next man up. In Cleveland‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs a very, very long list consisting of names like Bruce Gradkowski, Jason Campbell, Johnny Manziel, and Ken Dorsey.\nIt‚Äôs 37 names long, to be exact.\nWho‚Äôs next on the everlasting Browns QB jersey?\n[pic.twitter.com/4WUSk0glLQ]\n‚Äî Ravens Realest üê¶‚¨õ (@Ravens_Realest)\n[March 17, 2022]\nPrior to the 2023 season, the\nnumber sat at 34 with Deshaun Watson looking to take over for his second year. An injury led to three newcomers joining the lengthy catalog.\nPJ Walker, Dorian Thompson-Robinson, and now, Joe Flacco, have all landed starts this year.\nDespite the rotation, Cleveland is 10-5 and playoff bound should they finish out the season strong.\nDUDE Wipes teased a jersey partnership with the organization this offseason, seeing the team rock slick white uniforms for a Week 2 meeting with division rival Pittsburgh.\nThe jokes wrote themselves after that initial announcement, considering the brand manufactures unscented flushable wet wipes, with naturally soothing aloe vera and vitamin E for maximum comfort and cleanliness, claiming ‚Äúbillions of butts wiped.‚Äù\nThe company is continuing its play on the white jerseys with this latest promotion, and fans are pumped!\n‚ÄúTrading in an old Browns QB jersey for a Joe Flacco jersey is true sickos behavior that must be commended.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI have 14 former Browns QB jerseys. Is there a limit?!‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe price on the secondary market for old Browns QB jerseys is about to skyrocket.‚Äù\nIt sounds like there will be a solid turnout for the pregame event, and we should see a number of new white tops in the crowd Thursday night.",

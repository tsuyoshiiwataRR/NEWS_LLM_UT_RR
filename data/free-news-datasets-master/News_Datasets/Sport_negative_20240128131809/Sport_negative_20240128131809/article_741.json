    "text": "Watch Now: Richardson (back) will not play in Thursday's game against the Warriors.\nThis was the expectation with Richardson carrying a doubtful tag into Thursday's game. The Heat are going to be very shorthanded, as Jimmy Butler (calf), Kyle Lowry (rest) and Caleb Martin (ankle) are also out. Look for Duncan Robinson and Jaime Jaquez to each see heavy run against the Warriors, while Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo lead the offense.\nMore News Heat's Josh Richardson: Unlikely to play Thursday 1D ago • by RotoWire Staff Heat's Josh Richardson: Partially participates in practice 1D ago • by RotoWire Staff Heat's Josh Richardson: Downgraded to out 3D ago • by RotoWire Staff Heat's Josh Richardson: Probable for Christmas showdown 4D ago • by RotoWire Staff Heat's Josh Richardson: Good to go against Chicago 13D ago • by RotoWire Staff Heat's Josh Richardson: Remains out Thursday 14D ago • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Basketball Stories December rookie report: Chet, Victor, more Alex Barutha • 6 min read Christmas Day slate games, more Steve Alexander • 7 min read Waiver Wire: Week 10 Alex Rikleen • 6 min read Week 9 pulse check: Who's hot, who's not Alex Barutha • 7 min read Week 9 starts/sits: Top NBA fantasy plays Adam King • 4 min read Waiver Wire: Week 9 Alex Rikleen • 7 min read",

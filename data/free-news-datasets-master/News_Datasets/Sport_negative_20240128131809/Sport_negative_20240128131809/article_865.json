    "text": "Two F1 drivers don't deserve grid spot Source: Supplied Staff Writers from News.com.au December 29th, 2023 12:11 pm Two drivers on the Formula 1 grid should be counting their lucky stars, that’s reportedly the thoughts of outgoing AlphaTauri boss Franz Tost.\nSky Sports commentator David Croft lifted the lid on the damning remarks from the no-nonsense team boss.\nStream Over 50 Sports Live & On-Demand with Kayo. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today >\nCroft said an off-air conversation with Tost ultimately led the pair to talking about the quality of the current Formula 1 grid.\nAnd while Tost explained in detail why two men shouldn’t be in the paddock, Croft delivered the ultimate tease as he kept the identity of the individuals under wraps.\n“I had a fabulous exchange with him in the paddock at a race,” Croft said on the Sky F1 podcast.\n“We were just talking in general, sometimes you could get Franz when he had five or 10 minutes and just chew the cud of Formula 1 and we were talking about drivers.\n“He said, ‘Yeah, every single driver in this paddock deserves to be in this paddock, deserves to be in Formula 1 ... except two.\n“I said ‘Really? Two? And who would they be? He said, blah, blah, blah, and blah, blah, bla. I’m not going to name them, but I could not disagree with a word he said about that one.\n“And he then went on to explain absolutely why they really shouldn’t be in Formula 1 at the moment.\n“But I’m not going to tell you who because that will be unfair of those drivers.”\nTwo drivers don’t belong... (Photo by Clive Mason – Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images) Source: Getty Images\nThe outgoing AlphaTauri boss’ remarks, who is set to be replaced by former Ferrari engineer Laurent Mekies, add to what has been an intriguing off-season from the Formula 1.\nMcLaren boss Zak Brown delivered a not-so-subtle shot at Formula 1 rivals Red Bull and AlphaTauri.\nThe alliance between the two teams has continually raised questions among fellow teams on the grid with Brown questioning the integrity of the relationship in an open letter.\nWhile rules and regulation are in place, the ties between the two teams was strengthened in 2023 which ruffled feathers of its rivals.\nAs questions were raised over any potential rule breaks, Red Bull boss Christian Horner rubbished the suggestions.\nBrown however isn’t convinced and says the relationship between the two teams raises serious concerns ahead of the 2024 season.\nBrown took aim at Red Bull and AlphaTauri. (Photo by Jim WATSON / AFP) Source: AFP\nIn an open letter to McLaren fans, Brown reflected on the season that was and looked ahead to the next year where he delivered the shot at Red Bull.\n“Most other major sports prohibit the ownership of two teams within the same league because of the obvious potential damage that it does to competition,” Brown wrote.\n“It’s an unhealthy situation because it impacts decisions made both on and off the track.\n“Whether it’s a case of having access to more data, sharing components/personnel, or even having influence over a strategic vote, it’s not in the spirit of the regulations.\n“It’s important to stand up for independence, competition and fairness, and I’d like to see changes in the regulations to ensure that in future, they stop influence spreading from one team to another through strategic alliances and especially through ownership. Formula 1 should be true to its brand, and every team – except power units – should be totally independent of each other.\n“I believe Formula 1 fans universally believe in fairness in competition and a level playing field, and would reject any actions that compromise the true spirit of competition within Formula 1.\n“Part sharing of information, shared ownership models, and strategic alliances within the sporting fabric of Formula 1 will only serve to undermine the fans’ belief in fair and fierce competition.”",

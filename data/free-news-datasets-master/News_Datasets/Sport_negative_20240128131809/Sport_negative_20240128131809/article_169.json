    "text": "The New York Giants made a curious quarterback move this week when the team benched undrafted rookie Tommy DeVito for journeyman veteran Tyrod Taylor.\nDeVito had started the previous six games for the Giants after he took over for the injured Daniel Jones with Taylor still nursing a rib injury, but was benched midway through this past week‚Äôs match against the Philadelphia Eagles for Taylor.\nSo rather than return to DeVito for Week 17 against the Los Angeles Rams, the Giants opted to go with Taylor.\nThat decision puzzled analyst Peter Schrager.\n‚ÄúI was surprised by it, also,‚Äù Schrager said. ‚ÄúI guess they thought that the level was so, so far superior with Tyrod once he went in than with DeVito that story and narrative and salaries aside, like, you look at the rest of the team ‚Äì they get a better shot at winning the game against the Rams this weekend with Tyrod Taylor at quarterback.‚Äù\nWhat is going on with the\n[#Giants]QB room? [@davidhelman_]x [@PSchrags]discussüéô: [pic.twitter.com/vSNkusLFMB]\n‚Äî NFL on FOX Podcast (@NFLonFOXPod)\n[December 28, 2023]\nThe decision is also curious because of what it means for the Giants‚Äô short and long-term futures.\nDeVito had won three consecutive games for the Giants before a bad loss to the New Orleans Saints in Week 15 and a bad half against the Eagles, while Taylor almost led New York to a win over Philadelphia but had gone 1-2 in three starts earlier this year.\nTaylor completed 7-of-16 passes for 133 yards, one touchdown, and one interception in the loss.\nTaylor helps the Giants win now and can help offensive players grow fundamentally, but benching DeVito means the team can‚Äôt evaluate a potential backup quarterback more with Jones still recovering from his ACL injury.\nNEXT: Tyreek Hill's 'Secret Santa' Video Is Going Viral",

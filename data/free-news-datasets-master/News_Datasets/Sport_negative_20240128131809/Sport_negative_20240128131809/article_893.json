    "text": "Cleveland Browns wide receiver Elijah Moore is being evaluated for a concussion after a scary injury in the second quarter Thursday night. He hit the turf hard after catching a pass from Joe Flacco , and he immediately headed the blue medical tent with some help. Moore was having a big game at the time of his injury, hauling in five receptions for 61 yards and a touchdown. After spending some time in the tent, he walked back to the Cleveland locker room for further evaluation. Moore is having a career year in his first season with the Browns. He had new career-highs in receptions (54) and yards (579), but only had one touchdown to his name. He spent the last two years with the Jets before making his way to Cleveland. The Browns were down a key playmaker for Thursday night’s matchup. Wide receiver Amari Cooper appeared to tweak his injury during warmups, and he was ruled out as a result. That meant Moore and others would have to step up. If he’s unable to go, though, it’ll be next man up for Cleveland. With Joe Flacco at QB, Browns are rolling with playoffs approaching The Browns have put together an impressive stretch lately since Flacco took the reins at quarterback. They entered Thursday’s game 3-1 with the former Baltimore Raven under center, and quickly took control against the struggling Jets. Cleveland struck first when Flacco found Jerome Ford for a 7-yard touchdown and found pay dirt again when Kareem Hunt ran in a score. After Hickman’s pick-six, the Browns added to their lead again when Flacco hit Elijah Moore for a touchdown to make it a 27-7 lead in the second quarter. It was all Cleveland in the first half as the Browns took a 34-17 lead into halftime — and, you could say, it was an elite start for Flacco. He completed 16 of 22 passes for 296 yards and three touchdowns through the first two quarters. Entering Thursday night, Flacco was averaging more than 325 yards per game and his only loss came against the Los Angeles Rams in his first game with the Browns. Then, Cleveland started its three-game win streak with a 31-26 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Browns followed that up with a 20-17 comeback victory over the Chicago Bears behind 374 yards from Flacco. With a talented defense, things are getting interesting in Cleveland as fans start to set their sights on a possible playoff appearance. The Browns entered TNF as the No. 5 seed in the AFC.",

    "text": "Ja Morant is in the news again over his controversial celebration following another Memphis Grizzlies win. He‚Äôs been blasted on the internet for his celebration which people interpreted as firing guns. You know he‚Äôs been caught up in some gun stuff in the past and this celebration is being linked to firing or portraying guns.

But others countered by criticizing Morant for unveiling anything that even resembled ‚Äî or could‚Äôve been confused for ‚Äî finger guns, given that he‚Äôd just returned from a 25-game suspension for flashing a handgun on Instagram Live for a second time.

The exact optics and context behind his dance remain unclear, and the Grizzlies‚Äô team account even shared a clip on social media.

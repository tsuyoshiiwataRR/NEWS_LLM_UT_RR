    "text": "New Delhi: One doesn't have to look beyond Rohit Sharma's post-match comments, while carrying out a post-mortem examination of India's abject surrender by an innings and 32 runs in the first Test against South Africa in Centurion on Thursday. “If we have to win Test matches, we have to come together collectively and we didn’t do that. We didn’t exploit the conditions with the ball and then again didn’t show up today with the bat,” Rohit summed up India's performance perfectly after the end of the match on Thursday. India lost inside three days suffering batting failures in both the innings and unable to break through the South African batting line-up like the home team did against them at SuperSport Park. Traditionally a pace-favouring track, India were up against it after losing the toss and being sent into bat. For a team that has never won a Test series in South Africa in 30 years, countering the venom of a pace attack led by Kagiso Rabada proved to be too much for the much-vaunted Indian batters. Woeful batting In away conditions, particularly in the bouncy tracks of South Africa, Indian batters have historically failed to put up much fight. Judged by the yardstick, they didn't fare much poorer. But with India being the financial hub of the game and its star batters all being dubbed superstars of the modern era all exposed to away conditions, a little bit of application and gumption was expected. Their produced a performance that had anything but. Flat-track bullies at their own backyard, they had creases on their forehead once the ball began to seam and swing, poking at deliveries outside the off stump to offer catching practice to the slip fielders or judging the line incorrectly to have their defences breached. Only KL Rahul though his 101 in the first innings and Virat Kohli with his 76 in the second displayed the courage and determination to stay at the crease and survive under testing conditions. The others led by skipper Rohit Sharma were simply all at sea on how to do it. Rabada dismissed him twice, cleverly utilising the short ball to exploit his propensity to pull uppishly in the first innings and then poked at his suspect footwork in the second to have him bowled. It showed how much homework the Proteans did dismiss the Indians. As for the others like Yashshvi Jaiswal, Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill, they need to learn quickly and understand that batting abroad in Test cricket is a different challenge to inflicting misery on the bowlers in the IPL. With questionable batting techniques, how much they can offer at Newlands, where India have never won a Test, needs to be seen. They need to leave their big-hitting tendencies behind in the locker room and respect the conditions a bit more, taking cue from Rahul and Kohli. Inexperienced bowling Even before India had lost on Thursday, Indian commentators had begun blaming Indian bowlers for unable to restrict South Africa to anywhere near 245 that the visiting team put up thanks to Rahul's 101. They conveniently side stepped India's poor batting performance. While it's true that once India had conceded a 163-run lead, it was always going to be difficult for India in the second innings, but too conveniently blame 'soft target' Prasidh Krishna for his unimpressive performance is a bit too much. Even star bowlers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj weren't potent enough and with India's best all-format bowler Mohammed Shami absent with injury undoubtedly their bowling attack was weak. Rohit Sharma would have expected a bit more penetration from his pacers and fast-bowling all-rounder Shardul Thakur. But even in helpful conditions they weren't up to the mark, giving away too many runs. Elgar's last dance In his farewell series, Dean Elgar unleashed a different side to his batting that people were hitherto unfamiliar with. Normally a stodgy Test opener who backs his tight defence and unwavering concentration levels to bat for long hours, Elgar batted far more freely. He had a secret desire of scoring his first Test ton at his home ground and who knew he had saved it for his last appearance at the SuperSport Park. Elgar didn't try fancy shots or tried to flirt outside the off stump. But judged the loose deliveries correctly and dispatched them without fail. Equally importantly the 36-year-old guided his younger batting partners Tony de Zorzi, David Bedingham and Marco Jansen on how to bat, producing valuable partnerships that took the match away from India.",

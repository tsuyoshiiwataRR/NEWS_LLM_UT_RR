    "text": "Fermanagh's Brendan Dolan has stormed into the last 16 of the World Darts Championships with a huge upset win over fifth seed Gerwyn Price on Thursday evening. It was beautiful revenge for the 'History Maker' who [fell to Price in this competition in a sudden death leg](https://www.pdc.tv/news/2023/12/28/price-there-plenty-more-tank#:~:text=Three%2Dtime%20Grand%20Slam%20champion,the%20biggest%20one%20of%20all%3F%E2%80%9D) three years ago to the day, the same year the Welshman was crowned champion. Last time out, Dolan had displayed all of his battling qualities to [defeat best friend Mickey Mansell](https://www.balls.ie/darts/mickey-mansell-brendan-dolan-world-darts-championship-582677), and it was more of the same for Dolan tonight who defeated Price despite having the lower average. There was bedlam in the Ally Pally as Dolan finished off the victory. Price divided the crowd as per usual, but Dolan's gutsy win had the crowd off its feet. Take a bow Brendan Dolan üëè A win to remember for The History Maker üéØ [pic.twitter.com/Dg9t5rs3iS] ‚Äî Sky Sports Darts (@SkySportsDarts) [December 28, 2023] Brendan Dolan and Gerwyn Price respond after epic Dolan win Dolan told Sky Sports after the win that he relied on positive thinking as Price battled back. \"I was trying to tell myself positive things, you know, 'who cares if he wins it, you're holding your own throw. You can still do this, you're still in the game\" Brendan Dolan was forthright speaking to reporters after the victory in speaking about the third and fourth sets where Price was not his ruthless self He said: 'I suppose Gezzy didn't play as well as he could have. He definitely gave me a few sets, well, a set early on.' üó£Ô∏è \"I'm here to win, and I'm ready to fight!\" Hear the thoughts of Brendan Dolan, who produced an inspired display of finishing to dump out 2021 champion Gerwyn Price and progress to the last 16... [pic.twitter.com/4nE9QXS4Bs] ‚Äî PDC Darts (@OfficialPDC) [December 28, 2023] Price was magnanimous in a statement on instagram, saying: Absolutely gutted with chances I gave away with tonight, trying hard and beating myself up just wanna say how much I appreciate the crown [sic] getting behind me, just couldn't get a flow and Brendan took every chance I gave him, well done to him and hopefully I'll learn from this. #gutted But once again thank you. The buildup to the competition featured talk of Price saying he might skip it entirely and calling for a venue change. Dolan will now play the winner of Boris Krcmar and Gary Anderson in the Round of 16 either December 29 or 30.",

    "text": "Paige VanZant has opened up on the perils of cutting weight for UFC fights in a very candid discussion on her latest podcast episode with her husband, MMA fighter Austin Vanderford. Fighters often essentially dehydrate themselves to make the weight category for a fight and, as VanZant alluded too, often starve themselves or turn to other methods to flush their system out. Her husband Vanderford told VanZant he enjoyed the process, prompting her to tell him exactly how and why she does not. 'The best feeling in the world is after a weight cut, the next day,' Vanderford said. 'You feel so, so good.' VanZant, who fought in UFC for six years up to 2020, replied firmly, telling him: 'Nope. TMI, TMI, here I go: every time I cut weight. I s*** my pants.' Paige VanZant has boldly opened up about the perils of cutting weight for UFC fights VanZant, 29, fought in UFC for six years before stepping away from MMA back in 2020 She recently revealed that she makes more money through OnlyFans than by fighting She continued: 'Every single time I would weigh-in, I would try to rehydrate (and was) instantly sick. So, part of USADA (United States anti-doping agency) is once they see you, you cannot leave their sight, because, you know, it’s the whole anti-doping. 'Maybe you’re gonna go do something to mask the drugs or take something. I don’t even know. 'So, I had my drug tester in the bathroom with me for two hours, while I s*** my brains out.' VanZant is believed to be planning on a return to mixed martial arts at some stage but back in November, the 29-year-old opened up on how much money she has made through OnlyFans. 'OnlyFans has definitely been my largest source of income. I would say combined, in my fighting career,' she told Barstool Sports' Glenny Balls. 'I think I made more money in 24 hours on OnlyFans than I had in my entire fighting career. Combined. Yeah.'",

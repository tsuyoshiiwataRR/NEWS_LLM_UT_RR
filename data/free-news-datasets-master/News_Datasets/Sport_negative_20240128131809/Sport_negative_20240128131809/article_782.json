    "text": "Nick Saban and the Crimson Tide aren't taking any chances ahead of their playoff game vs. Jim Harbaugh and the Michigan Wolverines next Monday evening. In short, Alabama is making a change to how players can watch game film to prepare for the contest. \"We're just trying to secure our stuff,\" Alabama running back Jase McClellan said. \"[The coaches] didn't do much explaining. They just did it, told us and we adjusted to it.\" College football players can typically have solo film sessions which they watch on their iPads. However, Saban has banned those sessions. Players are only allowed to study film in group sessions. \"I think they said Michigan was stealing signs the first eight weeks or something like that,\" said Alabama WR Isaiah Bond on Thursday. \"So we're just watching film with the team, because we're not allowed to watch film on our own; we don't want any stuff like that happening again.\" Nick Saban isn't taking any chances. If watching film together, instead of alone, helps the Crimson Tide vs. Michigan then they're going to do it. \"I'm not going to get into the whole film thing like that,\" said Alabama offensive coordinator Tommy Rees. \"I'm not talking about it. Like I said, our job is to give our players the best chance to have success on the field. We're focused on what we're trying to do, and that's really it.\" Alabama takes on No. 1 Michigan on Monday night at 5 p.m. ET on ESPN.",

    "text": "Khawaja planned to display image of dove holding olive brancy Attempt to do so was rejected by the International Cricket Council Batter has pointed out the hypocritical nature of the ban\nUsman Khawaja has accused the International Cricket Council of adopting double standards in a fiery social media post after being banned from sending a message about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza at the Boxing Day Test.\nThe star batter had hoped to use images of a dove holding an olive branch, as well as a reference to article one of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, on one of his boots and bat in the clash with Pakistan at the MCG.\nThe plan was part of Khawaja’s renewed push to raise awareness for what he sees as a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nThe left-handed run machine had support from Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers Association, but his application was denied by the ICC on Sunday.\nKhawaja has won the support of his skipper Pat Cummins (pictured together on Christmas Day) for his plan to display a dove holding an olive branch on his equipment in the Boxing Day Test\nThe Aussie star took to Instagram to post images of other cricketers who’ve been allowed to display messages on their bats, like South African star Keshav Maharaj, who had the Hindu ‘Om’ symbol on his equipment at the World Cup (pictured)\nWest Indian player Nicholas Pooran had a crucifix on his bat along with the word ‘Believe’\nOn Christmas Day Khawaja took to Instagram to hit back at what he sees as hypocritical treatment from cricket’s peak governing body.\nHe uploaded a reel accompanied by Kanye West’s song ‘Can’t Tell Me Nothing’ and the caption, ‘Merry Christmas everybody. Sometimes you just gotta laugh. Cya at Boxing Day! #inconsistent #double standards’.\nThe reel featured an image of a black dove holding an olive branch above the words: ‘Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Free and equal. All human beings are born free and equal and should be treated the same way.’\nHis reel then switches to a series of images of cricketers who have displayed messages on their equipment during matches without being sanctioned.\nTrinidadian cricketer Nicholas Pooran is shown with a crucifix on his bat along with the word ‘Believe’.\nSouth African star Keshav Maharaj is seen with the Hindu ‘Om’ symbol on his bat at the recent Cricket World Cup.\nKhawaja ran the hashtags ‘#inconsistent #double standards’ on his defiant social media post\nKhawaja also pointed out that his teammate Marnus Labuschagne has been allowed to display an eagle on his bat in a reference to a Bible verse (pictured)\nCummins said Khawaja’s planned dove symbol is ‘not really’ any different to the image Labuschagne has previously used\nMarnus Labuschagne is shown with an eagle on his bat, which represents a Bible verse – and prompted skipper Pat Cummins to say Khawaja’s rejected dove symbol is ‘not really’ any different from the bird his teammate was allowed to display.\n‘We really support Uzzy. He’s standing up for what he believes and I think he’s done it really respectfully,’ Cummins said.\n‘[His initial message was] “all lives are equal” and I don’t think that’s very offensive, and I’d say the same about the dove.\n‘That’s Uzzy. I think he can really hold his head high with the way he’s gone about it.\n‘But obviously there’s rules in place and I believe the ICC have said they’re not going to approve that. They make up the rules and you’ve got to accept it.’\nKhawaja was previously charged by the ICC for breaching its clothing and equipment regulations after he wore a black armband without permission during the first Test in Perth.\nHe wore the armband – which he has since stated was to mark a ‘personal bereavement’ – after he was told wearing shoes with the words ‘all lives are equal’ and ‘freedom is a human right’ would breach ICC rules.\nKhawaja was wearing plain black shoes and was greeted warmly by members of the Pakistan team as players from both sides went through light training sessions indoors at the MCG on Monday.\nCummins’ support for Khawaja comes as Australia prepare to roll out an unchanged line-up for the Boxing Day clash, eyeing an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.\nVictorian hero Scott Boland has shone at the MCG in each of the past two summers, but has been unable to force his way back into the team for his home Test this time around.\nThe 37-year-old was charged by the ICC after wearing a black armband in the first Test against Pakistan – but said he did so to mark a personal bereavement, not make a political statement\nThe Australians are hot favourites after a dominant 360-run victory in Perth, and wet weather may yet prove the biggest obstacle to continuing their winning ways in Melbourne.\n‘It looks like there might be a little bit of rain about for the first day or so, but Test matches here seem to have moved a little bit quicker than at other places in the last few years,’ Cummins said.\n‘So I think there will be plenty of time to finish the game. I don’t think it (the weather) will change anything.\n‘[The wicket] looks pretty good. Fair bit of grass, probably a little bit harder and not as green as last year, knowing that it’s potentially going to be under covers today and a little bit tomorrow.\nPakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema (second from left) presented Cummins with gifts for the Aussie players and their families on Christmas Day\n‘We’ll see how it plays, but it looks like a really good wicket.’\nPakistan are set to make at least two changes, with pace bowler Khurram Shahzad (ribs) out injured and wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmed axed after the tourists’ demolition in Perth.\nThe gloveman has been replaced by Mohammad Rizwan, who made a half-century in the drawn tour match against a Victorian XI last week.\nPakistan will confirm the final make-up of their team at the coin toss and haven’t given up hope of challenging their world-champion hosts.\n‘This is a huge opportunity for all of us,’ Pakistan captain Shan Masood said.\n‘Any kind of setback provides you with the biggest opportunity to do well and get things right.\n‘It’s a testament to this squad that they’re looking to find ways to do well, to bounce back and put in a good performance. That’s all we care about.’",

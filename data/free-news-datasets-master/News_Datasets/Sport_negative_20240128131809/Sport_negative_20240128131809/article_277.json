    "text": "Arsenal fans are concerned about 'weak link' in their team that'll cost them the Premier League title Published | Last updated Arsenal fans are concerned that one player in their team could cost them the Premier League title. A drab [Arsenal](https://www.sportbible.com/arsenal) squandered the opportunity to go a point clear of Liverpool at the Premier League summit after losing 2-0 to [West Ham](https://www.sportbible.com/west-ham-united) at the Emirates on Thursday. After 13 minutes Jarrod Bowen poked the ball across to an unmarked Tomas Soucek, who slammed home the [Hammers](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/arsenal/declan-rice-arsenal-mikel-arteta-west-ham-683596-20231227) opener. VAR subsequently checked to see whether the ball had exited the pitch before Bowen reached it, but there was no 'clear and obvious' angle available to the officials. Former [Gunner](https://www.sportbible.com/arsenal) Konstantinos Mavropanos then towered above Gabriel Magalhaes and Oleksandr Zinchenko to power in a header off the underside of the crossbar to double West Ham's lead. West Ham almost capped off the win from the spot after former Hammer Declan Rice gave away a penalty in the final minute, but Saïd Benrahma had his effort saved by David Raya from 12 yards. And after [Arsenal](https://www.sportbible.com/football/transfer-news/inter-bankrupt-arsenal-man-utd-liverpool-transfer-news-582056-20231228) futilely laboured to draw level, several fans noted that Zinchenko's defensive frailty was a concern. Loading… On X, formally Twitter, on person said: \"Zinchenko is a player who has the ability and potential to single handedly cost you the league.\" Another wrote: \"Zinchenko isn't good enough going forward to allow for his constant defensive mishaps. \"E.g. with Trent Alexander-Arnold, you can say he is truly amazing going forward that you can make allowances for his defensive play. Zinchenko isn't in that bracket at all.\" A third said: \"The biggest proof that Sofascore means nothing is that Zinchenko's rating isn't bright red.\" A fourth wrote: \"It's so over for Zinchenko when [Jurrien] Timber returns.\" A fifth said, upon Zinchenko's substation: \"We replaced Zinchenko with an attacker and look more solid defensively.\" [Zinchenko was a revelation ](https://www.sportbible.com/football/zinchenko-arsenal-piers-morgan-432042-20230303)upon signing for Arsenal from Manchester City in the summer of 2022. However, this term he has struggled for form, having registered just one goal and one assist in the Premier League. The Ukraine international was substituted for winger Reiss Nelson after 63 minutes.

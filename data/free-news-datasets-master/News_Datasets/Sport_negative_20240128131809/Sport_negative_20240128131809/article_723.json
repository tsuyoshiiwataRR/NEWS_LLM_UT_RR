    "text": "Our 10-6 mark straight up last week was tolerable. The 5-11 stinker against the spread, not so much. I picked a bad week to have a bad week, dipping just below .500 ATS with only two weeks left. Ouch. The near-miss on our Upset of the Week was indicative. Titans led 17-13 with one minute left but fell to Seattle. I was off by two points on Jets’ win. Not good enough. Had Ravens with the points at San Fran Monday night and that was about it for the highlights. Must finish strong! [Note: Our Thursday night pick was @Browns (-7) over Jets, 19-13.]\n———\nWeek 16: 10-6, .625 overall; 5-11, .313 vs. spread.\nSeason: 147-93, .613 overall; 114-117-9, .494 vs. spread.\n———\nGREG COTE’S NFL WEEK 17 PICKS\n GAME OF THE WEEK\nDOLPHINS (11-4) at RAVENS (12-3)\nLine: BAL by 3 1/2.\nCote’s pick: BAL, 27-23.\n...continued swipe to next page « 1 2 3 » View full story\n©2023 Miami Herald.

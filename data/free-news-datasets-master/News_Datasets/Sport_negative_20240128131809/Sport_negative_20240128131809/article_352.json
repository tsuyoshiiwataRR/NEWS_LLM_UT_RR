    "text": "Mikel Arteta's Arsenal dropped three vital points in the title race as they were comfortably beaten 2-0 by West Ham United. It's a result that sees the Gunners remain in second place behind league-leaders Liverpool as they picked up three points at Turf Moor earlier in the week. The Irons took a somewhat controversial lead through Tomas Soucek after Jarrod Bowen picked him out in the box but it appeared that the ball may have crossed the byline. VAR took a lengthy look, like they did when a similar situation occurred during Arsenal's trip to Newcastle earlier in the season, but they decided to stay with the on-field decision. The main camera angle that VAR were looking at was in position behind Bowen's body and it was difficult to tell whether the entirety of the ball was out of play, due to it being hidden by the Englishman's body. West Ham went into the break a goal to the good and then doubled their lead shortly into the second half. James Ward-Prowse's corner found the former Gunner, Konstantinos Mavropanos, who powerfully met the ball with his head to beat David Raya. For David Moyes, he has put an end to a historically miserable record as he won his first Premier League away game against either Chelsea, Man United, Liverpool or Arsenal. Declan Rice then conceded a penalty in injury time to make matters worse for the £105 million signing, who had been jeered all night by his fellow fans. Said Benrahma stepped up to the spot but couldn't beat Raya with the last kick of the match. It's only the Gunners' third defeat of the season, their first at home and they find themselves two points behind Liverpool. Oh and don't forget about the reigning champions, who can go level on points if they win their game in hand. MORE: Premier League table in full FT: That's it! West Ham have done it. They've picked up two huge wins in the space of a week, after beating Man United at the weekend they've now come to the Emirates and ran over Arsenal. 95th minute: PENALTY SAVED! Raya makes a great save to deny Benrahma. 94th minute: Penalty to West Ham! It's Declan Rice who concedes it with a poor challenge in the box. 90th minute: There are five minutes added on. 84th minute: Arsenal really can't create anything clear-cut to find a way back. The Hammers are defending brilliantly. 76th minute: West Ham fans are sensing three points as they chant: \"Declan, what's the score? Declan, Declan what's the score?\" 73rd minute : The visiting side have managed to weather the storm well so far and their support are cheering every pass. Just a little over 15 minutes to go, can they hold onto the lead? 66th minute: A huge chance for the Gunners. This time it's White who clips a cross to the far post and Jesus can't keep his headed effort down. 62nd minute: It appears as though Arteta is preparing to make some substitutions. 56th minute: GOAL! WEST HAM DOUBLE THEIR LEAD! It's a fantastic corner from Ward-Prowse and Mavropanos rockets the header in. 50th minute: As expected, Arteta's side have come out of the interval on the front foot and you get the feeling this could be a long second half for the Hammers. 46th minute: The second half is underway! HT: That's all for the first half and West Ham lead after scoring with their only shot on target through Soucek. 45+4: Odegaard is brilliantly tackled by Ogbonna in the box to deny a potential goal-scoring opportunity. 45th minute: Six minutes of added time after the lengthy goal check and the Paqueta injury. 42nd minute: Saka off the post! West Ham lose the ball in a dangerous position and Arsenal look to capitalise but Saka's right-footed strike rockets off the near post. 37th minute: Arsenal create the chance well but Martinelli's effort is well wide. They need to start testing Areola. 31st minute: Paqueta picks up a knock and is substituted for Said Benrahma. 27th minute: Arsenal have a free-kick in a dangerous position on the left of the 18-yard box but they really mess it up and it's a waste of an opportunity. 20th minute: This stat via Opta isn't fun reading for Gunners fans: Arsenal have beaten West Ham 8 times in the Premier League having conceded the first goal, more than they have against any other opponent in the competition. 17th minute: After a lengthy VAR check to see if the ball remained in play before Bowen teed up Soucek, the goal stands! 13th minute: GOAL! 0-1 WEST HAM! Emerson's delivery is dealt with poorly by Zinchenko whose clearance is right into the path of Bowen and he knocks it back to Soucek who smashes past Raya. 10th minute: Slight chance for the Hammers as Ward-Prowse's free-kick finds Soucek but he can't redirect it goalwards and it goes out for a goal-kick. 4th minute: The Gunners have made a bright start and Martin Odegaard has just found Bukayo Saka with a neat backheel but the Englishman's shot was straight at Areola. 1st minute: We're underway at the Emirates! 15 minutes until kickoff: Nearly time for kickoff at the Emirates. Arsenal fans, you'll be glad to read that Spurs are 2-0 down at Brighton in the first half. 30 minutes until kickoff: Jarrod Bowen is making his 150th Premier League appearance this evening, can he mark it with a goal? 1 hour until kickoff: Team news is out! With Kai Havertz suspended this evening, Leandro Trossard comes in for the Gunners. Angelo Ogbonna starts as the skipper for the visitors. 1 hour 30 mins until kickoff: Bukayo Saka has been involved in 18 goals in his last 17 home games in all competitions, with 11 of those finding the back of the net and assisting seven. There's no place like home... 2 hours until kickoff: At least Declan Rice is playing with Bukayo Saka now! Arsenal will miss the improving Kai Havertz due to a suspension for yellow card accumulation, after picking up his fifth booking of the season against Liverpool last time out. A groin injury for Fabio Vieira means it will likely be Leandro Trossard who steps in for the absent German. Thomas Partey has returned to training and could be brought back into the fold in this match, needing a few substitute appearances before he's ready to start. Takehiro Tomiyasu remains out with a calf injury, and Jurrien Timber is a long-term absentee thanks to his serious knee injury. Arsenal starting lineup (4-3-3): Raya (GK) — White, Saliba, Gabriel, Zinchenko — Odegaard, Rice, Trossard — Saka, Jesus, Martinelli. Arsenal subs (12): To be confirmed Only the knee injury to Michail Antonio is a concern for David Moyes, who otherwise has his full contingent of West Ham players at his disposal. Antonio was injured on international duty with Jamaica back in November, and is \"improving and getting closer\" according to Moyes, but is unlikely to be ready for action just yet. West Ham projected starting lineup (4-2-3-1): Areola (GK) — Coufal, Mavropanos, Ogbonna, Emerson — Soucek, E. Alvarez — Kudus, Ward-Prowse, Paqueta — Bowen. West Ham subs (12): To be confirmed USA: Arsenal vs. West Ham from the Emirates Stadium will be televised in the United States exclusively on NBC's premium streaming service Peacock. UK: Thursday's match will be shown in the UK exclusively on Amazon Prime . Canada: Premier League matches can be seen in Canada all season long on Fubo , the nation's leading streaming service for world-class soccer. Australia: Australia's sole broadcaster for the Premier League is Optus Sport, who recently signed a new deal to telecast the product Down Under for the next six seasons until 2028 .",

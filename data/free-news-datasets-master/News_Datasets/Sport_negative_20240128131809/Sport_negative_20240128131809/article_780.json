    "text": "New York Giants rookie wide receiver Jalin Hyatt didn't receive a single target in his team's loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Christmas Day. That's despite the fact that Hyatt's six receptions for 109 yards against the New England Patriots in late November is still the best game by a Giants wide receiver this season. Hyatt played 35 snaps (56%) in the loss to Philly. While I'm sure it's frustrating for the former Tennessee Vols standout to get shut out by his own offense, he's not pouting because of it. In fact, quite the opposite. \"To me, I feel like I didn't help the team, that’s really how I take it,” said Hyatt said this week ( via SNY ). “Feel like I didn’t contribute. Feel like I wasn’t there for my team.” “At the end of the day you can look at it two ways,” continued Hyatt. “You can either be down and pout and have a bad week or you can come back this week and still prepare the same and still be ready for your opportunities at the end of the day it’s all about taking advantage of the opportunities. So that’s what I’m focused on.” “You can’t pout because you never know, next week it might be five targets for me, six targets, seven targets, and what if I’m not ready?” added the former Vol. Hyatt was known as incredibly hard worker during his junior season at Tennessee and it paid off in a big way on the field. We've already seen this season what Hyatt is capable of -- a 100 yard receiving game against one of the best defenses in the league -- and because of his refusal to pout, it feels like a huge breakout is on the way for the South Carolina native. The Giants just need to find a way to get him the ball.",

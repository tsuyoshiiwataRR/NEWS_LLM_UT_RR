    "text": "Melbourne City fire 8 GOALS against Roar | 02:30 Ronny Lerner, NCA Newswire from Code Sports December 29th, 2023 8:44 am Interim Brisbane Roar coach Luciano Trani believes the advantages that the well-resourced Melbourne City has over other A-League clubs are unfair.\nSpeaking after his first game in charge of the Roar, which resulted in a record-equalling 8-1 destruction at the hands of City, Trani described his vanquishers as a “global corporation”.\nCity are owned by the City Football Group which boasts English giants Manchester City, La Liga side Girona and MLS club New York City in its stable amongst other clubs from around the world.\n“They have resources beyond what an A-League club is and I understand that because I’ve been there and I know what the resources and facilities are,” said Trani who was a former assistant coach with Melbourne City.\n“They are a quality club that have all bases covered and it’s credit for them.\nStumped to gift ideas? This festive season, give the gift that keeps on giving. Gift a Kayo subscription from just $25 a month!\nCurtis Good celebrates a goal during City’s record-equalling thrashing of Brisbane Roar. Picture: Getty Source: Getty Images\n“But I look at it from a Brisbane Roar point of view and I’ve come here understanding that the challenges are there.\n“Yes, the league has 12 teams, but within the 12 teams there is quite a bit going on between what some other teams have got and what teams maybe are limited to.\n“I think it’s important to put into true context of this.\n“They can call on resources globally to assist their program and so therefore you’re not up against one or two individuals, you’re up against a team and a club that’s been modelled around getting the right message across, details that are across all levels at the highest level.”\nMelbourne City celebrate the 2021 title during their powerhouse run. Picture: AFP Source: AFP\nTrani admitted it would be hard to get his players up for their next game against Sydney FC at Suncorp Stadium next week, but stressed they had no other choice.\n“It’s challenging, yes. It’s not easy but I think it’s why we’re footballers and we’re involved in the game,” he said.\n“We have to remind ourselves that we have to back up a performance and improve from where we left off, and the only thing is you’ve got to bounce back.\n“Setbacks are going to happen in the world of football and it’s just one of those weeks where now we have to show what type of people we are and what characters and personalities we have in order for us to continue and move forward.”\nDespite having now conceded 13 goals in their last three matches, which have all been losses, Trani was steadfast on implementing an attacking, risk-taking brand of football.\n“We have made a conscious decision that we’re going to continue to play this way,” he said.\n“So, whether it’s hard-headed or whether it’s wrong or whether it’s right, we believe that if we want to get a football team that wants to enjoy football, we have to be on the front foot.\n“It’s going to be on the edge, but that’s the way it’s going to have to be or else...”",

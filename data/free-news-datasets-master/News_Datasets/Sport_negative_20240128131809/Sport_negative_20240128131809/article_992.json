    "text": "ANDERSON — Anderson’s tune-up for the Madison County tournament did not go as expected. Kieran Tewari scored 28 points and Yorktown’s bench accounted for its first eight points of the overtime session as the Tigers overcame a second-half Anderson rally and knocked off the Class 4A 10th-ranked Indians 74-72 Thursday night on Phil Buck Court. The Indians dropped to 5-2 on the season with their second straight loss while Yorktown (6-4) has now won five in a row. “We lost shooters and we were helping too much and (Tewari) shot a little better than we thought he would,” Anderson coach Donnie Bowling said. “I think we were overcompensating on the help, and when we were trapping, we were leaving one guy open. They would hit him, and he made the shot.” Early 3-point shooting from Yorktown and foul trouble and poor shooting from Anderson spelled trouble early and doom late. Led by Tewari, the Tigers connected on six of 10 3-point shots in the first half and, while an Anderson defensive adjustment in the third quarter slowed the long-range barrage, Tewari made four more 3-pointers in the second half, and Yorktown built a two-point halftime lead into a commanding 59-49 lead midway through the fourth quarter. But Anderson’s Damien King, saddled with foul trouble throughout, led the comeback. He scored the next 11 Anderson points, including two dunks and two three-point plays, and the Indians trimmed the deficit to 61-60 with 1:08 left. After Yorktown’s Jacob Grim — who finished with 12 points and seven assists — made one of two free throws, King found Javon Warfield for the tying basket. After both teams missed with their opportunities to take the lead, the game went to an extra session. “It’s tough, but Yorktown I’ll give credit, they’re a good team,” Bowling said. “This is just what happens sometimes.” A Christian Townsend layup with 2:47 left gave Anderson the lead at 65-64, its first lead since early in the third quarter. But it was a short-lived advantage as Connor Rowray scored his first — and only — basket for Yorktown. Baskets from Austin Kates and Nate Tyler — like Rowray, Tigers who did not score in regulation — followed, and the Tigers had a 71-65 lead. But King had fouled out, limiting Anderson’s options on offense. Collin Lewis drove for a basket, and Warfield made a pair of free throws to pull the Indians within 71-69, but Tewari made three of four free throws to ice the game before Townsend hit a 3-pointer for the final margin. King finished with 30 points, 11 rebounds and three steals while Warfield scored 20 and Townsend added 14 for the Indians. Matt Moulton scored 13 points for Yorktown. Tuesday, Anderson will begin its quest for a third consecutive Madison County championship when it travels to Pendleton Heights for its first-round game. The Indians defeated the Arabians 47-38 at home in the November season opener and have won seven straight meetings with their county rivals since Bowling took over prior to the 2020-21 season. Anderson is seeking to become the first three-peat champion since PH won three in a row from 2010-2012. “We’ll come back and practice hard (Friday), Saturday and Monday,” Bowling said. “We’ll see what we’ve got against Pendleton. If this doesn’t wake them up, I don’t know what will.” Yorktown pulled away late for a 51-42 junior varsity win over Anderson. The Indians were led by Jalen Jackson with 10 points.",

Demarai Gray, Moussa Dembele , and former Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum are also in Al-Ettifaq's squad. Gray managed to break the deadlock in the 70th minute, seemingly putting an end to Gerrard's nine-game winless streak, which had lingered for about two months. Al Ettifaq are struggling to find a win after going winless for the last two months It's All Kicking Off is an exciting new podcast from Mail Sport that promises a different take on Premier League football.

Earlier in the week, he pleaded for reinforcements to bolster his squad: 'We need to show in this window, and also the summer window, that we mean business and we want to be competitive at the top of the league, and not where we are at the moment. It's a collective thing.' Al-Ettifaq face tenth-place Al-Khaleej before a challenging away match against league leaders Al-Hilal, with Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ruben Neves on their books.",

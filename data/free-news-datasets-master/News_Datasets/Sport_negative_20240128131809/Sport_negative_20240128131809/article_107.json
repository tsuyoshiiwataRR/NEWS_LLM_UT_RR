    "text": "[West Ham United ](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/west-ham-fc)defender Konstantinos Mavropanos came back to haunt [Arsenal](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/arsenal-fc) and knock his former side's [Premier League](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/premier-league) title challenge off course. Mavropanos, sold by the Gunners in 2020, headed the all-important second goal that helped the Hammers to a 3-0 victory. [Mikel Arteta's](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/mikel-arteta) side needed a victory to return to the top of the table, after [Liverpool eased past Burnley earlier in the week](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/what-jurgen-klopp-right-liverpool-31752151). However, [ they controversially fell behind](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/soucek-goal-var-ham-arsenal-31764601) in similar circumstances to their 1-0 loss to [Newcastle United](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/newcastle-united-fc), when Jarrod Bowen cut the ball back for Tomas Soucek to prod David Moyes' side into the lead. It was almost deja vu for the North Londoners, as they, yet again, waited for VAR to look at the goal and decide there was no conclusive evidence to rule it out. At the other end, Arsenal missed chance after chance as Bukayo Saka hit the post, and Gabriel Jesus missed two second half headers while unmarked in the penalty area. When things looked like they could not get any worse, Rice scythed down Emerson in the penalty area, but Said Benrahma's spot-kick was saved. After the Gunners fell to their third Premier League defeat of the season, Daily Star Sport considers what Arteta may have got wrong.

He deployed Saka, Jesus, Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard in a five-pronged attack against the Hammers. Considering the strengths of all players are attack-orientated, it looked like a team that was chasing a lead from the first moment. They constantly looked vulnerable to a [West Ham](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/west-ham-fc) counter-attack, particularly when Rice marauded forward every now and then. With Jorginho on the bench, Arteta may well have regretted not deploying another defensively astute midfielder alongside Rice. No Plan B Do you think Arsenal can win the Premier League this season? Let us know in the [comment section](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-mikel-arteta-west-ham-31764759#commentsection) below At times, Arsenal's football was magical - unfortunately for them, such magic will rarely get through a brick wall. Once the Hammers took the lead, they had at least eight players behind the ball at all times. However, [Arsenal](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/arsenal-fc) always looked to get through the blue wall by going straight through the middle of it, allowing the Hammers' back four to tuck-inside and plug every hole in their backline. The Gunners never looked to try and go on the outside of the congested Hammers backline, until after the Hammers doubled their lead. Arsenal have rarely been denied this season, but there does not appear to be a Plan B in their attacking play. Little variation Arsenal's frontline were pitted against a Hammers' backline featuring a defensive pairing of Angelo Ogbonna and Konstantinos Mavropanos. The defenders are Moyes' third and fourth choice centre-backs, who had never played alongside each other in the Premier League. However, you would not have known this as the pair looked rather comfortable against the North Londoners. Arsenal needed to test the understanding between the Italian and the Greek aces by whipping in crosses, playing in behind and getting the likes of Jesus and Martinelli to run in-between them. However, most of their attacks seemed to be in-front of the West Ham backline - exactly where Moyes would have wanted them. Not using their 12th man The biggest positive for the Gunners is that the 60,000 odd fans at the Emirates did not stop the whole game. Despite going 2-0 down, the Arsenal fans were always banging the drum or singing. Yet, Arteta, nor his players, did anything to harness this noise. The odd \"come on\" to the Arsenal fans would have added even more volume to a rapturous crowd. Every point is precious for the Gunners now. They need to encourage as much noise as possible if they are to go all the way in the title race.",

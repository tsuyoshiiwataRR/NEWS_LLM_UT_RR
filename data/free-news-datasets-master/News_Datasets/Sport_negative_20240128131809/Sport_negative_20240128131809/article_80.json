    "text": "Cowboys putting pressure on NFL over lack of calls for Micah Parsons\nThe Dallas Cowboys are sticking up for one of their players over what they see as a lack of calls going in their favor.\nThe Cowboys have sent information to the NFL offices regarding the lack of offensive holding calls drawn by pass rusher Micah Parsons,\naccording to Jeremy Fowler of ESPN. While this is not unusual, the Cowboys are frustrated that Parsons rarely draws calls, which they feel contributes to him having just 1.5 sacks in his past four games.\nParsons himself has used social media to question what he has to do to draw flags.\nMicah Parsons taking to Instagram with his frustration over not drawing a holding call in a very long time. Did he really need a caption with this picture to make his point?! (Nope)\n[@FOX4] [pic.twitter.com/IsVufvp23H]\n— Jeff Kolb (@JeffKolbFOX4)\n[December 25, 2023]\nNobody doubts Parsons’ talent, and his stats do not reflect that. He certainly has a case for drawing more flags, as video evidence shows there are certainly some calls he could have gotten. Acknowledging this, Parsons\nhas proposed a pretty unusual solution for what he sees as a problem of missed calls.",

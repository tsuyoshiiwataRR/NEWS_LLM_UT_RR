His 4-touchdown, 0-interception game was the driving force behind San Francisco's dominant 45-29 win. At 9.7 yards per attempt (242 total), it was another ho-hum elite performance from the young sophomore. Despite the impressive stats, though, Purdy failed to keep one important streak alive - the 70% completion mark. At 16-of-25 passing, Purdy fell short of that lofty mark by a few percent, totaling a 64.0% completion percentage. Why does that matter? Simple - Brock Purdy was nearing the NFL's longest streak of games with a 70.0% completion percentage or higher. Only three other quarterbacks have ever reached the 7 game mark in this regard: Joe Montana (8 times, 1989), Sam\n[]https://www.49erswebzone.com/news/176152-shanahan-49ers-brock-purdys-injury/\nKyle Shanahan on 49ers QB Brock Purdy's injury: \"I think he's going to be fine\"\nBy David Bonilla\nDec 26\nSan Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan addressed reporters in a conference call on Tuesday morning, a day after the team's 33-19 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. While it was too early to provide comprehensive updates on the players who suffered injuries during the game, Shanahan expressed optimism regarding quarterback Brock Purdy's situation. Purdy aggravated his previous stinger injury, exiting Monday night's game in the fourth quarter. The initial injury occurred about a week earlier in a Week 15 contest against the Arizona Cardinals. \"Just watching him, how he was that week (after the Cardinals game), and then just being able to hear how he was today and talk to him last night after the game, I think he's going to be fine,\" Shanahan said. \"I don't think\n[]https://www.49erswebzone.com/news/175900-ravens-hamilton-disputes-narrative-system/\nRavens' Kyle Hamilton disputes narrative that 49ers' Brock Purdy is a system QB\nBy David Bonilla\nDec 20\nThe Baltimore Ravens are gearing up for a pivotal Christmas night matchup against the San Francisco 49ers and undoubtedly wish to refrain from providing the opposition with any bulletin board material. Still, starting safety Kyle Hamilton wanted to emphasize his respect for the 49ers' second-year quarterback, Brock Purdy, despite lingering labels such as \"game manager\" or \"system quarterback\" still being cast on the young player. These terms are being used to downplay what Purdy, the front-runner for NFL MVP, has accomplished this season. The narrative implies that Purdy's success is primarily attributed to the talented supporting cast around him and head coach Kyle Shanahan's exceptional offensive system. When questioned about Purdy, Hamilton stated, \"I mean,\nLatest\n-\n49ers' Christian McCaffrey the favorite for Offensive Player of the Year\n-\nBrock Purdy, Steve Wilks, Chris Foerster preview 49ers-Commanders Week 17 matchup\n-\n49ers vs. Commanders Injury Report: These 8 players missed Thursday's practice\n-\nNo Huddle Podcast: 49ers Look To Get Right In D.C.\n-\n49ers maintain confidence in secondary despite injuries\nTrending News\n-\n49ers Webzone • 5 hrs\n-\n49ers Webzone • 7 hrs\n-\n49ers Webzone • 6 hrs\n-\n49ers Webzone • 7 hrs\n-\n49ers Webzone • 9 hrs\n-\nSI.com • 11 hrs",

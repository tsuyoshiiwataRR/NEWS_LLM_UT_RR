    "text": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - Almost half of the yards the Bengals defense allowed in their 34-11 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers came on three plays, but the story of the team's defensive woes this season have primarily come from allowing big plays and defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo knows that has to stop for the season to continue into the playoffs. The Bengals (8-7) play at the Kansas City Chiefs (9-5) at 4:25 p.m. this Sunday mired in a battle with three other 8-7 teams for the final AFC Wild Card playoff berth. In the loss to the Steelers, the Bengals allowed three receptions to wide receiver George Pickens to account for 196 of their 397 yards of total offense with two of those receptions going for touchdowns. \"At this point of the season I don't want to make excuses for anything, but we can't win a football game if we give up 200 yards on three plays,\" said Anarumo. \"We are what we are right now. These things have to stop in order for us to be a consistent defense. These are things that have not shown up in a long, long time, but they've shown up this year. So whatever the reasons are, we will keep working at it like we're doing, but they can't continue. We got balls going over our heads. We got missed tackles on slants, those are the reasons.\" The missed tackle on the slant came on Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph's first pass of the game. Pickens made a move to get inside rookie cornerback DJ Turner and second-year safety Dax Hill, who is in his first year as a starter at that position, took bad a angle to try and tackle Pickens and not only missed, but knocked Turner down in the process. [The end result was an 86-yard touchdown.](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1738676470703161730) \"So you look at that play and let's just start with DJ,\" said Anarumo . \"DJ's got to do a better job of getting his hands on the receiver and then if the guy catches it, tackle him before it ever gets to Dax. But as the post safety or the single high safety in that defense, or any single high defense in the world, the number one thing that those guys are being taught is that they take the proper inside out angle to the ball and don't overrun it. That's what happened. He overran it, knocked off DJ and there you go. It's a critical error at a critical time, but it's a learning lesson, a tough one to take. They practice that stuff. It's not like he doesn't practice it, but it's just a little bit different when it's full speed.\" Not only is Hill in his first season as a starter at safety and Turner is a rookie, but the other starting safety for the last few games, Jordan Battle, is also a rookie. There is little doubt that inexperience has factored into some of the big plays allowed this season. \"I just think that some of it is still lessons that these guys are learning and we will be better for it in the future,\" said Anarumo. \"I keep saying that, but unfortunately in the future is like today and we have to get better at these things immediately. We try to stay calm and settle them down on the sideline and just keep fighting, playing with the technique that the coaches are teaching you. They want to be good. They're great listeners, they're very willing participants. Our guys, it's just a matter of just tightening it down on every little detail of what their jobs are and we've got to get better, which includes myself.\" While there are certainly growing pains for a chunk of the secondary, the other two long pass completions to Pickens came on a go route and a fade route against veteran Chidobe Awuzie. The first one covered 44 yards to set up a field goal before halftime, and the [ other went for a 66-yard touchdown early in the third quarter ](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1738701799551365383)after the Bengals had closed to within 24-8. Awuzie was having a stellar 2022 season before suffering a season-ending knee injury at Cleveland in the game No. 8, and he clearly hasn't returned to that form this season. He wouldn't put the blame on his issues against Pittsburgh being the knee, but he did point the finger at himself for allowing those plays. \"That’s something that, in the beginning of the year, maybe, but now I’m feeling good. I’m feeling confident,\" said Awuzie. \"My rhythm is back, I can’t look at ‘Oh, it’s my knee.’ Nah. I’m gonna be a man about it.'” He admitted to [getting too greedy on the 44-yard completion. ](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1738693451619705244) “I was just trying to do too much,” Awuzie said. “Down what we were down, I was trying to sit at the sticks when I shouldn’t have. I know I have to be over top. Put that one on me. Put the game on me. I didn’t play to my standard. I didn’t play to our defensive standard. It’s not on the coaches. It’s not on anybody else except the player. It’s on me. All I can do is look at in the face, deal with it and move on and try to be better.” Anarumo said Awuzie shouldn't blame himself for the loss. \"Here's a super accountable guy on a lot of levels, so it's not been an easy year for him just because of coming off the injury and not getting in the rhythm that he wants to,\" said Anarumo. \"It's hard as a corner if you're not out there play in and play out and just getting a feel for the game, getting a feel for the guy you're covering, how he's running things and just because of the rehab didn't probably allow him to do that early. He's feeling better now, so I still would never count him out.\" Awuzie was rotating with Turner for many games this season, but moved back into the starting lineup full time when Cam Taylor-Britt suffered an ankle injury the week of the first meeting with Pittsburgh on Nov. 26 and then placed on injured reserve, which cost him the next four games. He was designated for return on Wednesday and deemed himself ready to play this week after participating in Wednesday's practice. \"He's played a ton of ball so hopefully he'll be able to get right back out there and pick up where he left off, I'm hoping,\" said Anarumo. Taylor-Britt's return would be a huge boost, but it also may relegate Awuzie back into a rotational role with Turner. \"I'll kind to see how the week goes there on that to be honest,\" said Anarumo. \"When you're in these type of situations, it's all hands on deck, so whatever gives us the best opportunity this week we'll do.\"",

    "title": "Brighton hit Tottenham for four in Amex thriller",
    "text": "Tottenham missed a big opportunity to end the year in the top four as they were beaten 4-2 by Brighton in a thriller that lived up to its billing as the ‘feelgood football’ derby – not least thanks to a wonderful goal from Pervis Estupinan to mark his long-awaited return from injury.\nRespective managers Roberto De Zerbi and Ange Postecoglou have been credited with bringing the joy back to the beautiful game by opting for an attacking, progressive style that has won over fans and critics alike and driven their teams up the table; and it certainly showed at the Amex.\nBut just when it seemed Tottenham were set to put a ribbon on Postecoglou’s present to long-suffering Spurs fans after recovering superbly from a difficult November, his opposite number proved he is perhaps the more developed talent.\nFirst half goals from Jack Hinshelwood and Joao Pedro (the latter a penalty) gave Brighton the advantage in an end-to-end game in which both sides took turns to show off their attacking skills, never swerving from their determination to play football the right way – no matter the scoreline or the intensity of the pressing.\nThen Estupinan, put on at half-time by De Zerbi added a superb, curling finish that reminded Brighton fans what they have been missing (he has played just one game since September) – before Joao Pedro made it 4-0 with another penalty.\nWhat was most impressive about Albion’s performance is that it came despite the club still being plagued by injuries – even taking into consideration Estupinan’s return - with many of them long-term.\nThe jinx continued this week when wingers Kauro Mitoma and Simon Adingra were ruled out for at least five weeks. That made it eight players on the sidelines, all of them first team regulars.\nBut it didn’t seem to affect their attitude or style.\nDanny Welbeck, a player himself only recently back from long-term injury, saw two efforts saved in the opening minutes as Brighton found their feet first – and then boy wonder Jack Hinshelwood ripped home a super opener.\nThe midfielder, asked to play full-back because Brighton don’t have any right-back specialists currently fit, continued his remarkable rise at the age of just 18, and looks a real prospect.\nHe was nerveless as the ball fell to him in the penalty area, firing a shot high into the net past Guglielmo Vicario after being superbly set up by the rapidly improving Joao Pedro. That was the second of his debut season, having also headed a winner against Brentford here at the Amex.\nDefender Jan Paul van Hecke then headed against the post, before Brighton were awarded a penalty when Dejan Kulusevski stupidly dragged down Welbeck, although it took VAR to spot it. Joao Pedro, calmly, made no mistake to make it 2-0 with only 20 minutes on the clock.\nIt could have been 3-0 by half time, but James Milner’s fine effort from the edge of the area cannoned back off a post with Vicario well beaten. Then Facundo Buonanotte had a goal disallowed for offside following a sweeping move from the hosts – and Joao Pedro went clean through but couldn’t squeeze his effort past the visiting keeper.\nTottenham’s defending was woeful, but their saving grace was their pace on the break, which almost earned a goal in first half injury time, when Richarlison’s shot clipped Jason Steele’s near post.\nIt’s no exaggeration to suggest the half could have ended 6-3 to the home side, and nothing changed after the break.\nRicharlison was at the heart of all Tottenham’s good work and he had two goals disallowed for offside early in the second half; but there can be price for attacking with such commitment when you are facing a team more than capable of hurting you on the break. Especially when your defence is porous.\nSo, it was no surprise when Estupinan unleashed his special goal to confirm victory, or when when Lo Celso needlessly gave away penalty for a foul on Evan Ferguson – and Joao Pedro struck again from the spot with 20 minutes still to play.\nEven then there was a late consolation goal from 20-year-old Spurs sub Veliz, underlining Brighton’s inability to keep a clean sheet, and a second from Ben Davies as Spurs threw everything at the home team in a dramatic finale - including hitting the post through Hojbierg in injury time as the action never stopped for a second.\nBut perhaps that’s what everyone loves about the Seagulls; watch them and you’re guaranteed goals at both ends, with end-to-end excitement the name of the game.\nThis result moves De Zerbi’s side up to seventh, while Spurs miss out on a chance to hijack the top four; but the two entertainers, with 33 shots between them, certainly didn’t disappoint the neutrals.\nSteele 7, Hinshelwood 7, Van Hecke 7, Dunk 7, Igor 7 (Estupinan 45; 8), Milner 7 (Moder 69; 6), Gilmour 8, Gross 7, Buonanotte 7 (Baleba 60; 6), Welbeck 8 ( Ferguson 69; 6), Joao Pedro 9 (Lallana 90).\nVerbruggen, Dahoud, Baker-Boaitey, Barrington.\nVicario 7, Porro 6, Royal 5, Davies 7 Udogie 6, Sarr 6 (Gil 65; 7), Hojbjerg 7, Johnson 6 (Veliz 70; 7), Kulusevski 7, Son 6, Richarlison 8 (Lo Celso 65; 6)\nForster, Gil, Dier, Lo Celso, Phillips, Alonso, Donley, Dorrington.",

    "text": "Ex-Ohio State QB has major criticism of Miami program\nThe Miami Hurricanes finished off another underwhelming season Thursday with a Pinstripe Bowl loss to Rutgers, prompting one former national champion quarterback to deliver a damning verdict about their program.\nCardale Jones, who guided the Ohio State Buckeyes to a title in 2014, said on X Thursday he felt “bad” for any recruits that had committed to Miami for NIL money. To Jones, the Hurricanes have an unstable program with a terrible home atmosphere, and that “chasing the money isn’t always the answer.”\nMan, I feel bad for the recruits going to Miami U for NIL…….. bad staff, no stability within program and one of the worst college home game atmospheres.\nChasing the money isn’t always the answer. But good luck\n— Cardale Jones (@CJ1two)\n[December 28, 2023]\nThe Hurricanes are a long way removed from the glory days of the early 2000s. Though they have a robust NIL program that\nhas helped recruit some top talent, the program still appears to be treading water. Despite the splashy hire of Mario Cristobal as coach prior to the 2022 season, the Hurricanes finished just 7-6 this season, dropping Cristobal to 12-13 since his return to the school. He has also faced criticism for some of his game management.\nMiami will certainly be a factor in recruiting battles, and they are bringing in another highly-rated class for 2024. If things don’t turn around on the field, however, Jones’ commentary will probably be echoed by many others.",

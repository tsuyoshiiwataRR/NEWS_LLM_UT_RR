Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods Ten years ago, on this day, Ronda Rousey and Miesha Tate went up against each other in their highly anticipated rematch at UFC 168 in December 2013.\nWhile Tate escaped two submission attempts in the first two rounds, Rousey ultimately won the fight via third-round submission to retain her bantamweight title. In the aftermath, 'Rowdy' infamously refused to shake her opponent's hand.\nExpand Tweet Rousey and Tate shared one of the most fierce rivalries in MMA, and they are widely credited with bringing women's mixed martial arts to the UFC. Their rivalry began at Strikeforce, where Rousey won the 135-pound title against 'Cupcake' at Strikeforce: Rousey vs. Tate in March 2012.\nAfter the UFC absorbed fighters from the now-defunct promotion, Rousey was made the inaugural bantamweight champion, considering she held the title at Strikeforce. After defending her championship twice, she was booked against Tate for a second time after weeks of trash-talking and exchanging personal insults. As mentioned, 'Rowdy' successfully beat her rival again.\nWhile their fight was undoubtedly an entertaining affair, what stuck out to fans was Rousey's refusal to shake hands with Tate after winning the fight. Her unsporting attitude didn't sit well with fans, with many slamming her for it.\nAfter the MMA-based X handle, @MMAHistoryToday, reminded fans of the infamous incident that occurred ten years ago today, many flocked to the comments section to express their thoughts.\nExpand Tweet One fan wrote:\n\"That was a classless move.\" Another fan wrote:\n\"Rousey was always a b*tch and a poor sport. Took her losses worse than my little sisters too.\" Check out some more reactions below:\nScreenshots from @MMAHistoryToday on X",

    "text": "- Tottenham lost 4-2 in a six-goal thriller at the AMEX Stadium, including two from penalties - Spurs captain Son Heung-Min admits defeat was ‘a big wake-up call’ for players - Eddie Howe is crying out for help in the transfer market with Liverpool, Sunderland, Man City and Aston Villa to come. everything is beginning Son Heung-min criticized Tottenham’s performance in their 4-2 defeat at Brighton and demanded they use it as a “wake-up call” to keep the season on track. Despite coming into last night’s game on the back of three Premier League wins, injury-ravaged Spurs were trailing 4-0 before Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies scored twice. “That’s not how we’ve approached the season,” Son said. “This performance was nowhere near the level we want to play at. We know our mistakes, but now is not the time to point fingers at ourselves because the games are approaching quickly. “If we don’t play like the last 15 minutes of each game, we will have difficulties and this has to be a big wake-up call.” The first half was not our game nor us. We have to learn a big, big lesson.” Son admitted it was a “very disappointing” performance by Spurs against Brighton Tottenham suffered a miserable night on a night when their makeshift defense was exposed Jack Hinshelwood scored the first goal for Brighton with a fierce drive past Vicario.

Coach Ange Postecoglou attributed his team’s weak start to fatigue caused by the Spurs’ large number of absences. “It’s because we have 10 injured players,” he said. ‘You can only go to the pot a certain number of times, just like we played. Pervis Estupinan scored a magnificent goal as Brighton cruised to a 4-2 victory over Tottenham. Brighton doubled their lead from the penalty spot after Danny Welbeck was pulled off by Dejan Kulusevski. IT’S ALL STARTING!

    "text": "2023-12-29 00:35:27 A small feat for West Ham and a setback for the Gunners! By winning (0-2) at the Emirates Stadium, Alphonse Areola and his teammates stunned Arsenal this Thursday evening, at the end of the 19th day of the Premier League. The Gunners had to win to get back in front of Liverpool, take the lead in the championship and at the same time distance Manchester City and Unai Emery’s Aston Villa. But Mikel Arteta’s men lacked realism as the statistics of the match attest: 74.2% possession in their favor, 30 shots including eight on target, compared to only six including three on target for their opponents. Against them, the West Ham players knew how to be opportunistic by scoring at the start of the first half on a counter initiated by the former Lyonnais Lucas Paqueta and concluded by Tomas Soucek (13th). The referees hesitated to validate it, checking if the ball had not left the cage on the throw before the goal but ended up granting it. In the second half, it was from a corner and thanks to an uncrossed header from a former Arsenal player, Konstantinos Mavropanos, well helped by the post and the crossbar (55th), that West Ham made the break. The Hammers could even have finished off their opponents with a penalty obtained in the final seconds, stopped by David Raya. Tottenham ends its series in Brighton In difficulty away from home in recent weeks, the Hammers have performed very well in the race for European qualification. West Ham occupies sixth place in the Premier League table thanks to this success and is notably ahead of Manchester United. Earlier in the evening, the other meeting of this 19th day of the Premier League saw Brighton surprise Tottenham in a very rhythmic match (4-2). The Spurs, who nevertheless remained on a series of three consecutive victories, did not manage to catch up after two goals from Jack Hinshelwood (11th) and Joao Pedro (23rd from a penalty). They lost all hope after the third and fourth goals from Pervis Estupinan (63rd) and Joao Pedro (75th, again from a penalty), despite reductions in the score from Alejo Veliz (81st) and Ben Davies (85th). Tottenham are in fifth place in the standings. #Premier #League #Arsenal #fall #West #Ham #opportunity #lead",

Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods The NBA has been a business since it started in 1946. Throughout the years, commissioners have done their best to make it the best league in the world, and they've reached that feat for quite a while now. But change is inevitable, and even the association isn't immune to it.\nPatrick Bet-David, a podcaster, broke down an interesting take on the revenue that the league has been getting. There's no denying that there's been a decline in viewership for the past few seasons, which has affected their earnings. Despite having major sponsors, they're still on a gradual decline.\nBet-David pointed out that the league has lost half of the U.S. On Christmas, they had five games but only generated $14.2 million. The NFL, on the other hand, only had three games but earned $85.6 million.\nâ€¢\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now Expand Tweet He brought up the topic of the views the league had in 2022 compared to the views that the NFL had. The association had 4.3 million views per game while the football league had 21.9 million views per game.\nIn the past, commissioner Adam Silver mentioned that the decline of cable TV has affected the league's revenue. However, Bet-David believes that it should have affected the NFL since they both rely on views to generate revenue.\nIn 2022, the league ranked third in revenues among all the major leagues in America. The NFL had $17 billion, which puts them at the top. The second place belongs to the MLB, which had $10.5 billion. The NBA takes the third spot with $9.6 billion. The NHL and MLS take the fourth and fifth spots with $4.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.\nYou might also be interested in reading this: Where & how to watch LA Lakers vs Charlotte Hornets: TV channel List, online live stream details, & start time\nWhat are some of the reasons for the NBA's decline in viewership? There are a good number of reasons the NBA can bring up when addressing its decline in viewership. Bet-David lists a few of them that have affected the fans losing interest in the league.\nExpand Tweet They don't cater to fans According to Bet-David, successful leagues listen to their fans. Unfortunately, that hasn't been what the association has done for the past few years, and has listened and catered mostly to what the players want.\nThis has caused most stars in the league to be entitled, often getting what they want.",

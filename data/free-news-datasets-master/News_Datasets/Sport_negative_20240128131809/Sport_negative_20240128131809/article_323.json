    "text": "On Thursday's episode of The Paul Finebaum Show , a caller cooked up a unique hypothetical that would see Nick Saban retire, take a year off from coaching, and then returning to takeover and save the Florida Gators. The caller asked if Finebaum saw that as a possibility. As you can imagine, Finebaum did not. \"No, is there some reason why you do?\" Finebaum said. Yeah, there's no way that's happening. However, Finebaum does seem to think there very well might be a job opening in Gainesville pretty soon if Billy Napier can't get the Gators on track. \"Well, I don't know what Saban's going to do, but I think Billy Napier had better do something,\" Finebaum said. He's right. Florida finished with a 5-7 record in 2023 and missed a bowl game for the first time since 2017. Napier is now 11-14 over his first two seasons with Florida, and 2024 shows no signs of optimism with arguably the nation's hardest schedule. \"I appreciate your optimism for the future of Florida. I don't really have much optimism right now because I don't think people realize how truly bad that program is at the moment in terms of what it just got through losing and what it barely was able to hold on to and what I don't understand is the reason,\" Finebaum said.",

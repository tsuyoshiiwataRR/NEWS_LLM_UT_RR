    "text": "Thierry Henry called out Arsenal’s poor finishing following Thursday’s loss (Picture: Amazon)\nThierry Henry has named the Arsenal star who could have scored ‘two or three’ during Thursday’s 2-0 defeat to West Ham at the Emirates.\nThe Gunners missed the chance to go top of the Premier League following goals from Tomas Soucek and Konstantinos Mavropanos.\nSoucek’s opener was highly controversial – as the ball appeared to go out of play in the build-up – and it could have got even worse for the north Londoners had David Raya not denied Said Benrahma from the penalty spot after Declan Rice hacked down Emerson inside the box.\nArsenal’s wastefulness in front of goal was also evident, with Mikel Arteta’s team having 77 touches in the opposition box, the most on record in a single Premier League match for a team who failed to score.\nFollowing Arsenal’s defeat, which could be costly in the Premier League title race, Gunners legend Henry feels that Gabriel Jesus could have scored multiple goals.\nThe Brazil international forward has registered just three goals across 14 top-flight appearances this term.\n‘You knew Arsenal were going to get chances,’ Henry told Amazon Prime after the match.\nGabriel Jesus was wasteful in front of goal as Arsenal lost 2-0 (Picture: Getty)\n‘Sometimes it hits the post, there is a leg on the line or it is not finishing well.\n‘Gabriel Jesus could have scored two or three. He didn’t. But you have to give credit to West Ham. Not conceding at the Emirates is something amazing.’\nHenry also hailed three West Ham stars as well as the east Londoners’ recruitment after reinvesting the £105m they received from selling Declan Rice this summer.\n‘Edson Alvarez, not a lot of people talk about him, what he brings to the team is solidity,’ Henry added.\n‘What Jarrod Bowen did today to gain free-kicks, hold the ball and allow the team to breathe was vital.\n‘The amount of times Mohammed Kudus kept the ball and allowed his team to play higher was second to none. They have done very well with the money they got from the transfer of Declan Rice [to Arsenal].’\nNever miss a beat throughout the season or transfer window with weekly Arsenal news updates, exclusives and analysis.

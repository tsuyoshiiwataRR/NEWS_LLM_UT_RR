    "text": "It was played in England, but it could well have been at the Gigante de Arroyito . The three Argentines who participated in Brighton's 4-2 thrashing of Tottenham on matchday 19 of the Premier League were all born in Rosario Central . Alejo Véliz scored his first goal for the Londoners, Gio Lo Celso came on and committed a crude penalty, while Facundo Buonanotte was the one who celebrated for the home side.\nWithout Cristian Cuti Romero, injured, Tottenham's defence suffered too much. Four goals in 75 minutes, two from the penalty spot converted by Joao Pedro, a finish by Jack Hinshelwood and a tremendous left-footed shot by Ecuadorian Pervis Estupiñán .\nLo Celso, who had come on in the 64th minute after the third goal, was the author of the foul that led to Brighton's fourth goal, although he was also the one who pushed for the two stoppage times in the closing stages.\nThe first of these was the work of Alejo Véliz, assisted by Son Heung-Min inside the area, who controlled and finished with a volley, bitten, but not for that reason ineffective. Spurs' second goal was scored by Ben Davies.\nTottenham are not ready to compete for the Premier League today. We'll have to see if it's for Champions League qualification. His irregularity is latent, as he made visible again at the Amex stadium, where he collapsed when his recovery seemed certain, when he felt that he had found his way back without setting limits.\nThey finished in fifth place, one behind Manchester City and six behind Liverpool, who remained at the top of the table thanks to the incredible defeat of Arsenal, who at home did everything they could to win, but ended up losing 0-2 to West Ham.\nThe Czech Tomas Soucek (13th minute) and the Greek Konstantinos Mavropanos (55th) signed this victory for West Ham in the rain at the Emirates Stadium in London.\nThe Gunners are left with 40 points, two behind Liverpool (42), who had won 2-0 at lowly Burnley (19th) on Boxing Day on Tuesday and had provisionally taken the lead. Arsenal's defeat to the Hammers means that Jurgen Klopp's side's lead is firm, at least until the weekend.",

    "text": "CENTURION: India’s dream of winning a Test series in South Africa for the first time was ended inside three days as they crashed to an innings and 32 runs defeat at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Thursday.\nWith the series consisting of only two matches they can at best earn a share of the honors if they win the second Test starting in Cape Town on Wednesday.\nIndia crashed to 131 all out in their second innings after conceding a 163-run first innings lead.\nA day which started with the match evenly poised turned into a rout for the tourists.\nDean Elgar (185) and Marco Jansen (84 not out) transformed a slender 11-run lead for South Africa at the start of play into a strong position.\nThey shared a 111-run sixth wicket partnership as South Africa took an overnight 256 for five to 408 all out despite the absent of injured captain Temba Bavuma.\nVirat Kohli hit an aggressive 76 for India before he was last man out but the rest of the batting collapsed against South Africa’s fast bowlers on a lively pitch.\nThe second innings lasted just 34.1 overs. Kohli hit 12 fours and a six in an 82-ball innings. Shubman Gill made 26 but no other batsman scored more than six.\nKagiso Rabada set the tone for South Africa, bowling Sharma for a duck with a superb delivery which deviated off the pitch to hit the off stump.\nRabada, who took five for 59 in the first innings, took two for 32 and finished the match with an outstanding diving catch at long-on to dismiss Kohli off Jansen, who took three for 36.\nLeft-arm fast bowler Nandre Burger completed an impressive debut Test by taking four for 33, giving hm match figures of seven for 83.\nThree catches went down in the slip cordon but none proved expensive.\nElgar was named man of the match in his final Test on his home ground. He has announced he will retire from international cricket after the second Test.\n“It was pretty special for me,” he said.\n“It (the pitch) was pretty juicy. You’ve got to keep it nice and simple batting in Tests. Focus on the ball, play straight and play late.”\nIt was a policy which India were unable to follow, although Sharma paid tribute to KL Rahul for his “brilliant” century in the first innings.\nBavuma took no further part in the match after injuring his left hamstring on the first morning. A statement from Cricket South Africa said it had been decided he would not bat because of concern about him aggravating the injury.\nThere was no indication whether Bavuma would be fit for the second Test.\nElgar captained the team on the field after Bavuma’s injury and, having captained South Africa in 17 Tests, he would be favorite to take over the leadership in his final Test if Bavuma is not fit.\nIndia’s series dream ends in three-day defeat by South Africa\nhttps://arab.news/j2e2w\nIndia’s series dream ends in three-day defeat by South Africa\n- South Africa thrash India by an innings and 32 runs in first Test on Thursday\n- India crashed to 131 all out in second innings after conceding a 163-run lead\nCENTURION: India’s dream of winning a Test series in South Africa for the first time was ended inside three days as they crashed to an innings and 32 runs defeat at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Thursday.",

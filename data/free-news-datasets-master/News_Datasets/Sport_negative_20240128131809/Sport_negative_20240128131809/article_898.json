    "text": "After losing the series opener in Centurion by an innings and 32 runs, the Indian men’s cricket team would like to make a comeback in the second and final Test of the two-match series against South Africa. The second red-ball match between the two teams is scheduled to take place at Newlands in Cape Town on January 3. Indian batters produce a shambolic show in the series opener, but despite that, India is unlikely to make changes to the batting line-up. There is an option of playing Abhimanyu Easwaran, who replaced Ruturaj Gaikwad in the Test squad, but it is highly unlikely that the former India A captain will get a chance over Yashasvi Jaiswal, who wasn’t able to do much in the Centurion Test.But there are high chances that India will make a couple of changes in the bowling attack. Star all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja missed the series opener after complaining of upper back spasms on the morning of the match. In his place, world No. 1 Test bowler Ravichandran Ashwin was included in the playing XI, but he could only manage to take one wicket and score 8 and 0 runs. He is all set to be replaced by Jadeja, who is a much more reliable batter and an equally capable spinner in overseas conditions. Apart from Ashwin, Prasidh Krishna, who made his Test debut for India in the Boxing Day Test, could also lose his spot and get replaced by Mukesh Kumar. There were high hopes from Krishna after he picked up a five-wicket haul in the first four-day match between India A and South Africa A, but he couldn’t do much at SuperSport Park and was only able to take one wicket for 93 runs in 20 overs. He was criticised by many experts of the game for his poor show in the series opener.Shardul Thakur also wasn’t able to deliver with the ball, but due to his batting, he is all set to retain his place. India has never managed to win a Test series in South Africa, and after losing the series opener, the historic feat will not be achieved this time either, but India would like to win the Cape Town Test to avoid the embarrassment of losing Test series in South Africa.India’s likely playing XI for the 2nd Test against South Africa: Rohit Sharma (C), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mukesh Kumar, and Mohammed Siraj.",

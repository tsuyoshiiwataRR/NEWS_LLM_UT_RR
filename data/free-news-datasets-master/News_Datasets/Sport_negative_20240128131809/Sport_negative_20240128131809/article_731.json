    "text": "United States men’s national team defender Chris Richards had a heart-in-mouth moment on Wednesday when he was shown the first red card of his career. Thankfully for the 23-year-old the red card was immediately rescinded.\nDuring Crystal Palace’s 2-1 defeat to Chelsea the American defender — who plays a defensive midfielder role for Palace — took one for the team and committed a foul to halt a counterattack.\nIn the 73rd minute Noni Madueke had successfully dribbled past Richards and the USMNT player tried to pull on the Chelsea forward’s shirt to slow him down.\nWhen that was unsuccessful Richards finally brought Madueke down with a tackle near midfield.\nReferee Michael Salisbury immediately reached for a card but didn’t realize what color he was holding.\nAccidental Chris Richards red card vs. Chelsea\nThe ref gave Chris Richards a red by accident and then switched it to a yellow\n[pic.twitter.com/GvvCaBrrVt]— USMNT Only (@usmntonly) [December 27, 2023]\nSalisbury quickly switched the color of Richards’ booking and had a quick laugh. An incident like this can happen every now and again.\nThis same blooper even happened to the great Ronaldinho back in the day.\nCrystal Palace evaded going down a man but couldn’t avoid defeat as a late Madueke penalty sealed the victory for Chelsea.\nWhile current results haven’t looked great for Palace — no EPL wins in their last eight games — Richards has finally been getting playing time with the club.\nHe plays center back for the USMNT but has been converted into a defensive midfielder for Crystal Palace playing the full 90 minutes in the last six EPL games.\nRichards has shown promise in the role and helped set up Palace’s goal vs. Chelsea with a crunching tackle to win back possession.\nCHRIS RICHARDS TACKLE IN SLOMO. GOING TO WATCH THIS ON A LOOP UNTIL NEW YEARS EVE.\n[pic.twitter.com/cRxQ7H6N0E]— Men in Blazers (@MenInBlazers) [December 27, 2023]\nMichael Olise brings Crystal Palace level at Stamford Bridge!\n— NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer)\n[December 27, 2023]\nIf Richards keeps performing like this, and avoiding red cards, then Palace will surely record a league victory soon.",

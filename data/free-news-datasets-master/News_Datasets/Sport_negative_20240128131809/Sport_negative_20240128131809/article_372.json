    "text": "West Ham scored a controversial opener en route to their 2-0 win at Arsenal — prompting fresh questions about technology in the game. Tomas Soucek struck just 13 minutes into the London derby at the Emirates after being set up by Jarrod Bowen, but it was not clear whether or not the ball had gone out of play.\nAdvertisement\nDavid Moyes’ side doubled their lead through\nKonstantinos Mavropanos and Said Benrahma saw a last-gasp penalty saved by David Raya as Arsenal missed the chance to reclaim top spot.\nHere’s how the early incident unfolded — and what was said after the game…\nWhat happened?\nWest Ham made an early breakthrough at the Emirates after a promising move down the left saw Bowen pick up a loose ball and sidefoot it back across goal at the byline.\nSoucek applied the finish and referee Michael Oliver awarded the goal, but uncertainty ensued as to whether the ball was out when Bowen centred for his team-mate.\nThe goal-line technology system only applies to the goal line itself. That means Bowen’s involvement in the goal could instead only get the eye test in the VAR room at Stockley Park in west London.\nThe check by VAR Craig Pawson took three minutes and 22 seconds, before Oliver confirmed the goal would stand.\nArsenal’s players did not immediately dispute the decision and The Athletic’s Alan Shearer, speaking on Amazon Prime, said: “I can’t say for certain that the ball is out.”\nVAR couldn't find conclusive evidence that the ball went out of play, so West Ham lead ⚒️\n[#PLonPrime] [#ARSWHU] [pic.twitter.com/OfqE7nyKro]\n— Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport)\n[December 28, 2023]\nWhat are the rules and was the correct protocol followed?\nIFAB, who set the laws of the game, define the ball as being out as when “it has wholly passed over the goal line or touchline on the ground or in the air”.\nBut, crucially, on-field decisions can only be overturned by VAR when there is “clear and obvious” evidence a mistake has been made by the referee.\nOn this occasion, with Bowen’s thigh blocking a key angle, Pawson could not find conclusive evidence of an on-field Oliver error.\nFormer referee Mark Clattenburg, speaking on Amazon Prime, called for in-built chip technology in match balls to help aid decision-making but said Pawson made the right call.\nAdvertisement\n“There’s no other decision that the officials can give,” he said. “When you look at all the evidence we cannot be 100 per cent certain that the ball has gone out.”\nWhat was the reaction?\nA measured Arteta claimed he “hadn’t seen” the incident but said: “Everyone is saying, ‘Is the technology good enough?’ and that’s probably the question.\n“We all want the best technology possible so the decisions are clear. So that’s something we can improve.”\nHe later said in his press conference: “They’re saying it’s not conclusive. It’s a shame that with the technology that we have, that it’s not that clear so that we can say whether it’s out or in. It’s done. It’s gone. There’s nothing we can do about it now.”\nBowen said he had no idea if the ball had stayed in, saying: “When it happens in split-seconds… it’s hard to tell at the time, you try to keep it in play.”\nHaven’t we been here before?\nYes — only last month. A far more animated Arteta called the decision to let\nAnthony Gordon’s winning goal for Newcastle stand a “disgrace”.\nThe VAR on duty that day, Andy Madley, was tasked with checking whether the ball had stayed in play, whether there was a foul by a\nNewcastle player and also whether there was an offside.\nThe goal dominated post-match discussions, with Arteta saying it was “embarrassing” as he vented his frustration in his press conference.\nAgain, Madely found no conclusive evidence that the ball went out of play when\nJoe Willock went to retrieve it.\nAngles shown on live television suggested it was an extremely tight call — bringing to mind an incident in the 2022 World Cup.\nJapan scored a vital goal against Spain after the ball appeared to be out, but it was later shown to have been still in play, with the curvature, or overhang, proving pivotal, even by mere millimetres.\nGO DEEPER\nArsenal 0 West Ham 2: Gabriel could have made VAR irrelevant, forwards lack cutting edge\n(Photo: Getty Images)",

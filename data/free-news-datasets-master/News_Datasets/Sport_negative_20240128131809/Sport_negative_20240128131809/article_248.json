    "text": "While the Michigan Wolverines are undefeated, the Big 10 champions, and the No. 1 team in the country, Jim Harbaugh’s program has been in the headlines throughout the year for the all the wrong reasons as well. An alleged sign-stealing scandal that dominated the college football media sphere for months and led to Harbaugh being suspended the last three games of the regular season was enough for the Crimson Tide to change the way the players are watching film to prepare for the Rose Bowl. Players have not been allowed to watch film on their personal tablets individually, an unprecedented added layer of security, only watching film together as a team. Alabama wide receiver Isaiah Bond says the Crimson Tide can't watch film on their tablets because of the Michigan sign-stealing scandal. [pic.twitter.com/6lHwTbP62C] — Alabama Crimson Tide | AL.com (@aldotcomTide) [December 28, 2023] “We just didn’t want to take no chances,” star right tackle JC Latham said. “It’s a really big game. I think we have a really great film staff and guys who make sure our film is pretty secure but we’re just taking another precaution to make sure we’re all good.” Receiver Isaiah Bond said something similar, but that he was not extremely familiar with the situation and that no matter what, Michigan still has to play them. RELATED: [Why more pressure is on Michigan than Alabama](https://yellowhammernews.com/why-more-pressure-is-on-michigan-than-alabama/) “When we get on the field they’re gonna have to play us anyways, so all that sign-stealing isn’t gonna help them,” Bond stated. The investigation against Michigan is still ongoing and the extent to which wrongdoing was occurring is still unknown, but it seems like Nick Saban and company are taking no chances when it comes to preparing for the Wolverines.

    "text": "San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel addressed the team's recent loss and the criticism they have been receiving while on the \"Up and Adams\" show with Kay Adams. Despite the loss, Samuel remains confident in his team's abilities and their position as the number one seed in their division. When asked about the loss, Samuel acknowledged that turnovers were a major factor in their defeat. The team had five turnovers, including three in the first half, which severely impacted their chances of winning. However, Samuel emphasized that regardless of the loss, they still hold the top seed and control their own destiny. In regards to the criticism surrounding quarterback Brock Purdy, Samuel defended his teammate and expressed frustration with how quickly people are quick to judge and criticize. He pointed out that Purdy has had many successful games and that one bad game does not define his abilities. Samuel stated that it is unfair how the media and fans are so eager to tear him down. Furthermore, Samuel addressed the comments made by Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons. Parsons took a jab at Purdy on social media after his own team's loss. Samuel brushed off Parsons' comments, stating that the 49ers had beaten the Cowboys weeks ago and questioned why Parsons was still concerned with their team. He also jokingly mentioned Cam Newton's recent comments, highlighting how Newton had praised Purdy before changing his tune. Despite the loss, Samuel maintains a positive outlook and continues to focus on the next game. He stressed the importance of minimizing turnovers and believes that everything else will fall into place. Samuel also shared his post-game routine, which involves receiving treatment and getting his body ready for the upcoming game. You can hear more above.

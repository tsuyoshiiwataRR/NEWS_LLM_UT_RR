    "text": "After missing out on the Premier League title in the 2022/23 season,\nArsenal are title challengers once again this season. Since the start of the season, they have not dropped below the top 5 and were usually found in the top 3. In the last 6 game weeks, they were at the top of the league for 4 of them, but after losing to West Ham United at home they have now dropped to 2nd.\nIn a match that highlighted all of Arsenal’s problems, West Ham had just 6 shots on goal and scored 2. Meanwhile, Arsenal had 30 shots, with 8 on target. They also had a record-breaking 77 touches in the opposition’s box without a goal.\nThomas Soucek opened the scoring in the 13th minute, which happened due to a massive error by Ben White. Trying to clear the ball, White hit the ball into Oleksander Zinchencko. The ball deflected off the Ukrainian and looked like it had gone out of bounds.\nJarrod Bowen managed to cross it back in for Soucek, who scored. After a lengthy VAR check, the goal was awarded.\nFormer Gunner, Konstantinos Mavropanos, scored the winner in the 55th minute. It came off a corner taken by James Ward-Prowse. Arsenal had over 75% possession, but\nDavid Moyes’s low block created problems for Mikel Arteta’s team. They just were unable to get past the defenders to get a single goal. Declan Rice gave a penalty in the final moments of the match, but Said Benharama’s penalty was saved by David Raya. WATCH: Jose Mourinho HILARIOUSLY shrugs off Arsenal while PREDICTING Premier League 23/24 champions\nFans banter Arsenal as they ‘bottle’ the top-of-the-table yet again\nMany fans took the opportunity to make fun of Arsenal, who were no longer table toppers. Rival fans made fun of the Gunners’ inability to score, as they took over 30 shots without a single goal. Some said they were ready for Arsenal fans to cry, who were unhappy with the VAR call regarding the first goal. Some praised Martin Odegaard, who put up a great performance.\nCheck out some of the fans’ reactions:\nWith this loss at home,\nArsenal lose their spot at the top of the table. They now sit with 40 points, 2 behind Liverpool. With Manchester City having a game in hand, they could overtake the Gunners as long as they win the extra fixture. Arsenal now play Fulham at the Craven Cottage on New Year’s Eve.\nIn case you missed:\n“Trophyless again this season” – Fans MOCK Tottenham Hotspur as Brighton secure dominant 4-2 victory WATCH: Real Betis officially extends Isco’s contract with HILARIOUS Ali G video Syed Talib Haider",

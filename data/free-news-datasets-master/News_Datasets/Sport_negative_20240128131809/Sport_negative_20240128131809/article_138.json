    "text": "Raheem Mostert (ankle) remains out Thursday for Miami Miami Dolphins running back Raheem Mostert (ankle) did not practice again on Thursday for Week 17 versus the Baltimore Ravens. Mostert has been held out of both practices this week while he manages an ankle injury, but he's expected to play on Sunday. De'Von Achane (toe) is also banged up, so Jeff Wilson could see an uptick in snaps and touches against the Ravens. Despite logging a season-low 19 snaps in last week's win over the Dallas Cowboys, Mostert still handled double-digit touches and scored a touchdown. Mostert is the RB25 in numberFire's Week 17 rankings and our models project him for 11.2 FanDuel points, with 11.9 carries, 58.7 rushing yards, 2.0 receptions, and 15.7 receiving yards. The Ravens are allowing the sixth-fewest FanDuel points per game to running backs this season and they have the No. 12 run defense in the NFL, according to our opponent-adjusted efficiency metrics.

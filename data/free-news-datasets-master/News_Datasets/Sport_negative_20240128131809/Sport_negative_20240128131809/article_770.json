    "text": "The next time Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson grants an interview he might be with a different team. Asked by The Denver Gazette on Thursday if he had anything to say about having been benched in favor of Jarrett Stidham for Sunday’s game against the Los Angeles Chargers, Wilson politely declined. When asked if he might speak to the media before the end of the season, he said he didn’t know. Head coach Sean Payton announced Wednesday that Wilson will be the backup quarterback for the home finale at Empower Field at Mile High. Stidham presumably also will be the starter for the Broncos (7-8), who are all but out of the playoff race, for the Jan. 6 or 7 regular-season finale at Las Vegas. “Russ is still my dawg,’’ running back Javonte Williams said Thursday. “I’m always going to support him and I mean it’s just the league. It is what it is. I know he’ll be all right and I trust the coaches.” The belief by many is Wilson won’t be back next season with the Broncos. He has a $37 million contract guarantee for 2025 that would be invoked if he is still on the roster March 17, the fifth day of the new league year. A source confirmed Wilson was asked by the Broncos during their bye week after an Oct. 29 game against Kansas City if he would be willing to eliminate that guarantee of $37 million for the increased possibility of remaining with the team in 2024 but he declined to do that. “A bunch of people have been saying it was broached back in October,’’ said salary-cap analyst Jason Fitzgerald, who runs the website [OvertheCap.com](http://OvertheCap.com). “I thought Wilson might waive that guarantee to stay on the field in 2024 (with Denver). I can’t imagine he would do something now to benefit the Broncos and help them with the salary cap, so I think they will release him.” The cap consequences of releasing Wilson, 35, would be enormous but guaranteeing Wilson $37 million for 2025 now seems to be off the table. The Broncos, even without Wilson as their quarterback for the next two seasons, would incur $85 million of dead money. As explained by Fitzgerald, Wilson already is on the books for 2024 for a guaranteed $17 million base salary with a $22 million option bonus, which means he is guaranteed $39 million for the season. If the Broncos release Wilson, he likely would be given a post-June 1 designation and Denver would incur dead money on the cap of $53 million in 2024 and $32 million in 2025. The money in addition to the $39 million that still would be on the cap would be remaining prorated amounts on signing bonuses Wilson got of $50 million in 2022 and $20 million for 2023. Wilson had a base salary of $7 million in 2022 and his base number this season is $8 million. Wilson, who made nine Pro Bowls in 10 Seattle seasons and led the Seahawks to a Super Bowl win in his second season of 2013, was traded to Denver in March 2022 for a bevy of players and draft picks, including two in the first round and two in the second round. The Broncos then signed him to a five-year, $245 contract extension before he played in his first game with them. Wilson had a disastrous 2022 season, throwing 16 touchdown passes with 11 interceptions and having a career-low passer rating of 84.4 for a 5-12 team. Wilson has been much better in his first season under Payton, throwing 26 touchdowns with eight interceptions and having a passer rating of 98.0. But the Broncos still have a losing record after dropping three of their last four games and Payton has grown weary of a quarterback who will have made a total of $124 million from Denver if he ends up being released by March. “This one is pretty much as bad as it gets,’’ Fitzgerald said of deals that have been done in NFL history. “The contract that might come close is whatever happens with Deshaun Watson in Cleveland (a fully guaranteed five-year, $230 million deal signed in 2022). But to pay (Wilson $124 million) for two years of service when your team basically is a losing team both seasons basically kills you (on the cap), not to mention everything you gave up.” In terms of a trade, Fitzgerald said it might be the worst in the NFL since “Minnesota trading for Herschel Walker and giving up all those picks to Dallas” in 1989. In terms of money being paid to Wilson, Fitzgerald said it makes it potentially even worse. “With the amount of dead money over a two-year period, I’d say it’s one of the biggest missteps, probably the biggest (in NFL history),’’ he said. A tiny silver lining is whatever Wilson might make for another team in 2024 would be offset and paid to Denver. However, Fitzgerald expects Wilson would look to sign for the minimum of $1.21 million in 2024 while seeking a second year on a deal in which he potentially could earn more than $20 million in 2025. “His value is less than $39 million (in 2024), so why would a team pay him $20 million (in 2024) for money that would just go back to Denver and why would Wilson agree to that?’ Fitzgerald said. “It wouldn’t make sense.” Fitzgerald already lists the Broncos as potentially being $18 million over the salary cap in 2024 with Wilson’s $35.4 million number included. If the Broncos instead incur $53 million in dead money on Wilson in 2024, that potentially would put them about $36 million over the cap. However, Fitzgerald sees the Broncos as having a number of players with big contracts that aren’t guaranteed who could be released, traded or have deals restructured. Those players include tackle Garett Bolles ($15.74 million base salary for 2024), safety Justin Simmons ($14.5 million), wide receivers Courtland Sutton ($13 million) and Tim Patrick ($9.5 million) and defensive tackle D.J. Jones ($9.49 million). In the meantime, the Broncos will press on with Stidham as their quarterback while also thinking about Wilson. “I love Russ,’’ said guard Quinn Meinerz. “I’m proud of how he’s handled this situation. This is a wild situation. It’s been great to play with him and share a lot of great memories with him.” Broncos offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi, who said he first heard from Payton about the move Tuesday, said Thursday it’s a “tough situation” and Wilson is “obviously disappointed.” But Lombardi is proud of him handling it like a “consummate pro.” “I’m sure it’s tough mentally but he’s handling it like a pro, with his head up, always positive,’’ said center Lloyd Cushenberry. “But we still have a job to do these next two games.” After that, barring an unexpected trip to the playoffs, the waiting game will begin. And soon after the new league year begins March 13, Wilson likely will be on another team. |Year||Age||Base salary||Prorated bonus||Roster bonus||Guaranteed||Cap number||Dead money| |2022||34||$2 million||$10 million||$5 million||$7 million||$17 million| |2023||35||$8 million||$14 million||$8 million||$22 million||$107 million| |2024||36||$17 million||$18.4 million||$17 million||$35.4 million||$85 million| |2025||37||$37 million||$18.4 million||$55.4 million||$49.6 million| |2026||38||$40 million||$18.4 million||$58.4 million||$31.2 million| |2027||39||$44 million||$8.4 million||$1 million||$53.4 million||$12.8 million| |2028||40||$50 million||$4.4 million||$54.4 million||$4.4 million| |Total||$198 million||$92 million||$6 million||$32 million||$296 million|",

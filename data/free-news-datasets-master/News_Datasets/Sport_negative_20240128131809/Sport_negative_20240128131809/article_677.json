Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods Russell Wilson entered his second season with the Broncos, expecting to turn it around after a forgettable 2022 season. It was a slow start for Wilson but turned a corner in the second half of this season. However, head coach Sean Payton made the move to bench the 35-year-old quarterback with two games remaining.\nThis decision did not sit well with Emmanuel Acho of the Fox Sports 1 show \"Speak\". Acho laid fault with the Broncos for a lackluster season and credited Wilson for doing his end of the deal:\n“Russell Wilson was benched and I believe that he is taking too much heat... Russell Wilson gave the Denver Broncos Super Bowl Russ but the Denver Broncos did not give Russell Wilson a Super Bowl environment.\" •\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now \"First, I will start with the numbers though the numbers don't tell the whole story, look at 2013, Russell won the Super Bowl then look at this year…Russ in 2013 is the same Russ that you are seeing this year, the dilemma is you're not seeing that Super Bowl defense.\" Expand Tweet Acho concluded:\n\"Now I get it that the Legion of Boom was generational, but can you give me the 2015 Broncos defense? Russ fulfilled his end of the bargain, what I would submit to you is that the Denver Broncos did not fulfill their end of the bargain.” The Denver Broncos (7-8) started the season with a 3-5 record, then won three straight before dropping three of their last four games. A reason for the nine-time Pro Bowler's benching is equally financial and preventative.\nWilson has an injury guarantee of $37 million for 2025 that would kick in should any kind of injury happen over the last two weeks that would stop him from passing a physical next March. He inked a five-year extension with Denver worth $242.5 million last September. In hindsight, some are noting that it is one of the worst contracts in recent memory.",

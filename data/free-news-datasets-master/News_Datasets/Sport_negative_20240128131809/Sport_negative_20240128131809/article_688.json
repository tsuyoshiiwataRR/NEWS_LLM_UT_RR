    "text": "Ange Postecoglou will have a headache heading into the new year, after his Tottenham side’s top-four Premier League credentials were damaged by a miserable performance in a 4-2 loss at Brighton on Friday morning (AEDT).\nLate goals for Tottenham by Alejo Véliz and Ben Davies gave the score a respectable look but the visitors – with as many as 10 players missing through injury – were outplayed at Amex Stadium.\nJack Hinshelwood powered a shot into the roof of the net in the 11th minute and Joao Pedro converted the first of two penalties in the 23rd after Dejan Kulusevski pulled back Danny Welbeck in the area.\nFOLLOW LIVE: Boxing Day Test Australia v Pakistan day four\nJames Milner also struck the post for Brighton in a first half that saw Tottenham’s defence – missing injured centre backs Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven – get sliced open time and again.\nAnge Postecoglou’s Spurs suffered a heavy 4-2 loss on the road to Brighton.\nRicharlison also hit the post and had a goal ruled out for offside for Tottenham before halftime substitute Pervis Estupinan made it 3-0 with a shot that flew into the top corner in the 63rd.\nJoao Pedro scored his second – again from the penalty spot – in the 75th after Evan Ferguson was fouled by Giovani Lo Celso, but Tottenham then rallied late.\nVeliz netted his first Premier League goal after Kulusevski blocked Lewis Dunk’s clearance straight to Son, who set up the Argentine forward in the 81st.\nWhen Davies headed in Pedro Porro’s cross four minutes later, a sensational comeback was potentially on but Brighton held on despite more chances for Tottenham, which would have jumped back into the top four with a victory.\n“We probably looked a little bit tired, you’ve got to be fair to the lads they’ve put in a hell of a shift over the last few weeks,” manager Ange Postecoglou told Amazon Prime Video.\n“We looked a bit leggy and Brighton were good. We hung in there until the end and can’t fault the effort.\n“The team continues to show character, we lacked energy tonight and against Brighton that’s going to cost you.\n“It was a mountain to climb in the end and from our perspective, the lads gave it everything they could in the game and that’s all I can ask for.\nJoao Pedro celebrating after putting his side 2-0 up from the penalty spot.\n“We’ve got 10 players injured. You can go to the well as many times and the way we play … the players give everything in every game and that’s all I can ask for. It’s a credit to them we are in the position we are.\n“All a new manager can ask for is to ask for his players to give everything they’ve got and that’s what I got today.”\nSpurs still sit fifth on the Premier League ladder, a point behind Manchester City in fourth.\nThey next play Bournemouth at home early New Years morning (AEDT).",

    "text": "RUSSELL Wilson has liked a social media post claiming he has played better than Patrick Mahomes shortly after getting benched by the Denver Broncos. The 34-year-old nine-time Pro Bowl quarterback has been benched for the final two games of the season in favor of backup Jarrett Stidham. Denver has lost three of their last four games, including most recently a brutal 20-14 Week 16 loss to the New England Patriots. The Broncos have just a six percent chance of making the playoffs as they sit with a 7-8 record. On Tuesday, reports were revealed that Denver has decided to bench Wilson in Weeks 17 and 18. The benching is seemingly financially motivated as Wilson is set to receive a $37 million guarantee in the 2025 season if he fails a physical in March. After the benching, Wilson liked numerous posts on X that defended him. One of the posts that Wilson liked centered around his stats in 2023 which claimed he has \"outplayed\" Kansas City Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes. The post brought up that Wilson and Mahomes both have 26 passing touchdowns, but the Broncos signal-caller has eight interceptions, compared to the Chiefs quarterback's 14 picks. And Wilson has three rushing touchdowns, while Mahomes has zero. Wilson also liked a post from former NFL star-turned-ESPN analyst Robert Griffin III, who wrote: \"Mad respect for how you have handled this entire situation @DangeRussWilson. \"When you were disrespected, you still showed respect. When you were threatened, you led your team to wins. When you were torn down, you kept building up your guys and never wavered. God’s got your back.\" On Tuesday night, Wilson took to X and made a cryptic post to his 5.5 million followers. \"God’s got me. Looking forward to what’s next,\" Wilson wrote. The Broncos face the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday. Denver will officially be eliminated with a loss.",

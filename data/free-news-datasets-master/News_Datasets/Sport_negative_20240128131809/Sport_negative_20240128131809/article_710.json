    "text": "2023-12-28 23:06:26\nClearly, Mikel Arteta is never happy with refereeing, especially video. After a big rant against VAR during his team’s defeat at Newcastle in early November (1-0), the Spanish coach once again took the liberty of criticizing the decision of the officials aided by technology, due to of a ball released – or not – from Jarrod Bowen, decisive passer on the first goal of the Hammers, winners this Thursday evening on the lawn of the Etihad (2-0): “it’s like that. The technology we currently have is not clear enough to determine if the ball is out.”\nThe rest after this ad\nThe Gunners technician nevertheless wanted to have a word on his team’s performance, believing that the final result did not reflect the dynamics of the meeting: “we want to be at the top and today we are very, very disappointed. We dominated the match so much. We are in a very good position. Today is a disappointing evening. We need to get our act together for the big game against Fulham. We dominated for 100 minutes. When we had important situations, we had players inside the box completely free. I think the players made a huge effort. The locker room is tough right now, but we have another game in 72 hours. It’s football, we have to improve in certain areas.”\nPub. 12/29/2023 00:06 Updated 12/29/2023 02:00\n1703813712\n#Mikel #Arteta #puts #spin #VAR",

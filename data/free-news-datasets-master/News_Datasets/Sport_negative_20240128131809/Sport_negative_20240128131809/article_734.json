    "text": "Martin Odegaard blamed a lack of efficiency in both boxes after we slumped to a 2-0 defeat to West Ham United.\nIt was our first home defeat of the season, and it was despite us racking up 30 attempts on goal and enjoying 74 per cent possession.\nBut the skipper admitted we weren’t ruthless enough in front of goal to take anything from the game.\n“I think we created more than enough to score goals to win the game and it was the little details and the little last pass or the finish that was missing today,” he said afterwards.\n“We have to learn from it and make sure we get sharper and better in front of the goals.\n“The goals we conceded were too easy, so definitely in front of the goals, inside the boxes, that’s where the games are decided. We weren’t good enough today.”\nThis was our 26th home game of 2023, and just our third defeat, and the skipper added that the team were disappointed not to round off the year on a high in front of our own supporter.\n“It’s a tough one. We always want to give the fans a good performance, we always want to win. It was the last home game of the year so we wanted to finish off in style, but today wasn’t the day and we have to look at ourselves and we have to learn and move on.\n“It’s another game in a very short time so it’s no time to feel sorry for ourselves, we have to move on and learn.”\nCopyright 2023 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.

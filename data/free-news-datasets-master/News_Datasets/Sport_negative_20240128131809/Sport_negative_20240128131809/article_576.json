    "text": "A teenage boy who was killed by a shark while out surfing with his father in\nSouth Australia’s Yorke Peninsula has been remembered as a “kind and respectful kid” with a passion for the water.\nKhai Cowley, 15, was\nattacked while swimming at Ethel Beach, near Innes National Park, about 1.30pm on Thursday.\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Teenager killed in shark attack identified.\nWatch the latest news and stream for free on\n7plus >>\nIt’s understood he had been bitten in the leg.\nAmbulance crews attended the difficult-to-access beach and recovered the boy’s body from the water.\nFriends of the avid surfer have posted tributes on social media, with one writing that the young teenager had “so much potential”.\n“He will hold a place in everyone’s heart,” the family friend wrote.\nKhai’s auntie Lauryn Barley, who has\nset up a fundraiser to help cover funeral costs, said the young teen had the “most beautiful soul (and was) taken from us too soon”.\nBarley wrote that Khai had been attacked by a white pointer, otherwise known as a great white shark.\n“I’m here to try help raise funds for my sister Kate and brother Tim to cover the cost of the funeral service. Any donations will be most appreciated,” she wrote.\nSurfing South Australia also posted a tribute online describing Khai as a “happy, kind and respectful kid” who was “very much loved by his surfing peers”.\n“After the devastating news that one of our Grom surfers, Khai, was involved in a fatal incident at Ethel Beach on December 28th we have been keeping Khai’s family and friends in our thoughts,” it said.\n“Khai was very involved in our surfing community with his passion for surfing stemming from a family with deep surfing roots in SA.\n“He will be greatly missed out in our community and on the water.”\nOver $10,000 has already been raised via the\nGoFundMe.\nIt’s understood Khai had been holidaying with his family at the time.\nThe attack comes after a spate of serious shark bites in recent months, including the fatal attack of 55-year-old Tod Gendle at Granites Beach on the state’s West Coast in October.\nHis was the second shark death this year after 46-year-old teacher Simon Baccanello disappeared without a trace in May while surfing at Walkers Rock Beach, about 365km west of Adelaide.\nStream Free on",

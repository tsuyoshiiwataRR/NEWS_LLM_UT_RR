    "text": "Karim Benzema ‘s side isn’t at its best on the domestic front. Tuesday’s 2-5 loss against Cristiano Ronaldo and Co. added more to their misery. But it seems the storm clouds won’t be going away easily, as hours after their shocking defeat against Al Nassr, one Al Ittihad star has found himself in the crosshairs of the disciplinary committee, resulting in a substantial fine.\nAmerica’s Favorite Video Today\nThe player who is currently in the negative limelight is Abderrazak Hamdallah . The Al Ittihad centre forward has been sent a fine notice by the Saudi Pro League disciplinary committee. After the heavy defeat, the 33-year-old was expected to give a post-match interview. However, Hamdallah snubbed the media obligations, heading straight to the tunnel instead. This led the committee to penalize him with a 20,000 riyals, or a $5333 fine.\n🚨🚨🚨 عاجل :\nلجنة الانضباط تغرم عبدالرزاق حمدالله 20 الف ريال لغيابه عن اللقاء التلفزيوني بعد مباراة #النصر .\n— نواف التميمي 📊. (@Nawaf_STATS) December 28, 2023\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nNotably, Hamdallah was the one who notched two goals for Al Ittihad, outshining star player Karim Benzema . Sadly, Cristiano Ronaldo’s penalty double, Anderson Talisca’s strike, and Sadio Mane’s brace sent the striker’s efforts in vain. Things had gone downhill for Al Ittihad as Fabinho was sent off in the 66th minute. With 28 points and sixth place, it is evident that the defending champions won’t be celebrating their New Year in high spirits.\nAl Nassr came into this match with a terrible head-to-head record. They hadn’t won against this opposition since December 21, 2018, and their winless run had lasted eleven games. However, they finally managed to break the five-year spell . On the other hand, the aftermath had a depressing effect on Benzema.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nKarim Benzema suspends his digital footprint after taking a beating from Cristiano Ronaldo and Co. After the game, keen-eyed fans observed the disappearance of Karim Benzema’s Instagram account. The prolific striker, who had garnered an impressive 76 million followers, has opted to deactivate his account entirely . The specific rationale behind this decision remains undisclosed, with the French striker choosing not to provide any explanation regarding the move.\n’It Happens Because It’s Cristiano Ronaldo”- Otavio Reveals Al Nassr’s Secret Weapon of Exposing Opponents\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nCoincidentally, this happened after the defeat against his former Real Madrid teammate’s side. Additionally, the 36-year-old also became the target of his fanbase , who nicknamed him “Ben-Hazima,” meaning “the son of defeat.” Furthermore, Al Ittihad boss Marcelo Gallardo was even slammed for starting the 2022 Ballon d’Or winner. It seems things have completely gone south for Benzema. Let’s hope the new year turns out well for the Frenchman.\nTrending Cristiano Ronaldo Is NOT Really the Top Scorer of 2023!

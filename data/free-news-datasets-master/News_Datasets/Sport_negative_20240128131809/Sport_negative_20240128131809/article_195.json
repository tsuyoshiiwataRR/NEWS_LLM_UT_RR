    "text": "The Cincinnati Bengals and the Kansas City Chiefs have history, and Ja’Marr Chase is making sure everyone remembers that these teams are not friendly with one another.\nOn January 29, 2023, Cincinnati and Kansas City made national headlines when the Bengals traveled to Arrowhead Stadium for last season’s AFC Championship game . The Joe Burrow-led Bengals had historically given Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs serious problems up to that point. Cincinnati made sure the Chiefs (and their fans) also knew it by calling Kansas City’s stadium “ Burrowhead .”\nPredictably, it backfired , and the Chiefs went on to win a Super Bowl. However, it seems old habits die hard (and rivalries are forever) because Ja’Marr Chase just went scorched earth on the Chiefs’ defense during a recent interview.\nWHEW, BOY.\nJa’Marr Chase didn’t back track at all when asked about his assessment of Chiefs defense. “They can take it how they want. I don’t care. … I’m not Ironman. I can’t throw the ball to myself. It’s a team sport.” pic.twitter.com/KmnaKIcLYe\n— Mike Petraglia (@Trags) December 28, 2023",

    "text": "Fabio Silva has joined Rangers on loan from Wolves until the end of the season Silva has been unable to make a major impact since signing for Wolves for £35m Chris Sutton and Ian Ladyman give their best sporting moments of the year on It's All Kicking Off\nWolves forward Fabio Silva has agreed to join Rangers on loan for the rest of the season.\nThe 21-year-old cost Wolves a then club record £35million when he joined from Porto in 2020 and there were high expectations, but he has failed to make an impression in the Premier League and has had two loan spells away at Anderlecht and PSV Eindhoven.\nAll parties hope the move to Scotland can kickstart the Portugal U21 international’s career.\nSilva said: ‘This first-half of the season things haven’t gone my way at Wolves but now with this opportunity I want to give everything here.\n‘It is amazing, everyone knows I had other options and other clubs but when I saw the option of Rangers, I was very happy. It was my first option straight away because I want to win titles, to play at big clubs, to feel the pressure and to play in big competitions so I want to play for the fans and play with my teammates.’\nWolves forward Fabio Silva has joined Rangers on loan for the rest of the season\nSilva has struggled to make a major impact since his £35m move to Wolves in 2020\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nDuring his time at Wolves Silva has scored just five goals in 72 appearances.\nSilva’s only goal for Wolves this season came against Blackpool in the second round of the Carabao Cup.\nSilva is looking forward to the challenge awaiting him in Scotland after securing his loan",

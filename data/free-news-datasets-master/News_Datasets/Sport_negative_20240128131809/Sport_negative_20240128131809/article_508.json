    "text": "Schefter: Browns' Amari Cooper (heel) now inactive for Week 17 The Cleveland Browns have ruled out Amari Cooper (heel) for Thursday's Week 17 game against the New York Jets. Cooper appeared to be trending in the right direction for tonight's game against the Jets' elite defense, but evidently wasn't able to do enough in the team's pregame warmups to suit up for the game. He'll take the weekend off to recover as the Browns gear up for playoff push. Cooper's absence could lead to even more targets for tight end David Njoku, but also for wideouts Elijah Moore and Cedric Tillman. Njoku should be the top priority for the Browns' passing game, and has a $6,600 salary to go with his 9.2-FanDuel-point projection.

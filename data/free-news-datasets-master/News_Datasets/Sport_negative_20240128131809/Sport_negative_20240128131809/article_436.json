    "text": "[Tottenham Hotspur](/football/spurs/) manager [Ange Postecoglou](/people/ange-postecoglou/) sarcastically hit out at VAR after the Lilywhites [were beaten 4-2](/football/spurs/result/brighton-triumph-in-six-goal-thriller-despite-late-spurs-fightback_532355.html) by [Brighton & Hove Albion](/football/brighton-and-hove-albion/) in Thursday's Premier League contest.\nThe Lilywhites travelled to the Amex Stadium on a run of three straight victories in the top flight, but a makeshift rearguard comprising four full backs were carved open with just 11 minutes gone on the South Coast.\nSeagulls academy product\n[Jack Hinshelwood](/people/jack-hinshelwood/) fired a ferocious effort into the roof of the net to break the deadlock, not long before [Dejan Kulusevski](/people/dejan-kulusevski/) was penalised for a clear tug on [Danny Welbeck](/people/danny-welbeck/)'s shirt.\nOn-field referee\n[Jarred Gillett](/people/jarred-gillett/) initially waved away Brighton's appeals, but after reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor for a good couple of minutes, he pointed to the spot, where [Joao Pedro](/people/joao-pedro/) did the rest.\nPostecoglou has not been shy in expressing his disdain for VAR since taking the reins in North London, and the Australian reiterated his contempt for technology in his post-match press conference, also making reference to a shocking\n[Lewis Dunk](/people/lewis-dunk/) challenge on Kulusevski which he was not sent off for.\nAsked about Brighton's first-half penalty, Postecoglou said: \"It was obviously clear and obvious because it only took him three minutes to see it on the screen and VAR picked up everything today except the one tackle which nearly cost me another player. So that's their decisions.\"\nThe highlight of a miserable first half for Tottenham was a late\n[Richarlison](/people/richarlison/) strike which grazed the outside of the post, and the Lilywhites found themselves three goals behind in the 63rd minute, as [Pervis Estupinan](/people/pervis-estupinan/) found the top corner with a sensational long-range effort.\nWith 15 minutes of normal time remaining, Brighton were awarded another penalty when\n[Giovani Lo Celso](/people/giovani-lo-celso/) barged into [Evan Ferguson](/people/evan-ferguson/) from behind, and just as he did in the first half, Pedro sent [Guglielmo Vicario](/people/guglielmo-vicario/) the wrong way.\nHowever, Tottenham suddenly came to life in the final third inside the closing 10 minutes, as\n[Alejo Veliz](/people/alejo-veliz/) netted his first top-flight goal and [Ben Davies](/people/ben-davies/) headed home to cut the deficit in half, sparking hope of an improbable late fightback.\nIt was not to be for Postecoglou's beleaguered troops, though, as\n[Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg](/people/pierre-emile-hojbjerg/) also struck the frame of the goal before the final whistle blew, and the Tottenham boss admitted that tiredness bedevilled his side at the Amex.\n\"Look, fair to say we were looking a bit tired and lacked our usual sharpness, especially at the start of the game. We've been starting games well. I guess that's understandable, we've been on this run for a whole now and asking players to perform at levels,\" Postecoglou added.\n\"It's very demanding the way we play physically and today we kind of looked like a team that wasn't at its sharpest. Brighton are a good side and they took advantage of that. Ultimately what I do know is the players everything they had they gave and that's all I can ask for.\n\"Everything they've got the players are giving me. I can't ask any more of them. We're in the position we are because of enormous efforts of a really small section of our squad and they did it again today. They've shown that all year. Whatever they've got, they'll give. That's all you can ask for.\n\"Right to the end they were pushing. With every resource in them they were pushing to try to get something out of the game and it's a credit to them. We are in that position through as much the players' sheer efforts as our football.\"\nPostecoglou also confirmed that Kulusevski appears to have avoided serious damage from Dunk's crunching tackle, and\n[fifth-placed](/football/premier-league/table.html) Tottenham have just two full days to recover before they welcome Bournemouth to North London on New Year's Eve.",

    "text": "Mikel Arteta is set to face the press after Arsenal's Premier League clash with West Ham United at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners got off to a good start in the game and almost took the lead through Bukayo Saka after some sublime skill from Martin Odegaard. They quickly found themselves behind against the run of play though when Tomas Soucek turned home. The goal was not without its controversy though, with the ball seemingly going out of play before Jarrod Bowen could provide the assist. VAR however, could not find a conclusive angle. Arsenal continued with attacking intensity and went close through Saka and Declan Rice. Again though, West Ham sprung a sucker punch as former Gunner Dinos Mavropanos rose highest at a corner to make it 2-0. Arsenal continued to plug away and should have had at least one back when Gabriel Jesus missed an absolute sitter. Ultimately though they failed to ever really trouble Alphonse Areola in the West Ham goal. You can hear what Mikel Arteta has to say on all that and much more with football.london's chief Arsenal correspondent Kaya Kaynak in our live blog below. Arteta on whether taking chances issue can be solved internally What we have is the players that we have, the players that I love the most. What we have to do is get better situations, more confidence and training Arteta on the game Congratulate West Ham and praise my players. When you look at how much we generated in the game to see the result is disappointed. They were better in the boxes though. Arteta on the first goal I haven’t seen it. They’re saying it’s not conclusive. It’s a shame that with the technology that we have that we can’t say if it’s clear. Player ratings Odegaard a rare bright spark for #AFC, but so many poor performances. Trossard and Zinchenko stand out, but Jesus will have done little to answer the questions about his potency in front of goal with those second half misses. Read Kaya Kaynak's full player ratings [here](https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/fixtures-results/arsenal-player-ratings-vs-west-28361267). Welcome Hello and welcome to football.london's coverage of Mikel Arteta's press conference after Arsenal's 2-0 defeat to West Ham in the Premier League.",

    "text": "CLEVELAND -- Leading [Browns](/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns) receiver [Amari Cooper](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976499/amari-cooper) sat out Thursday night's [37-20](/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547623) playoff-clinching win over the [New York Jets](/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets) because of a heel injury. Cooper had been dealing with the injury all week. He tried to run during pregame warmups but was ultimately ruled inactive. The Browns lost another starting receiver to injury during the game. [Elijah Moore](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4372414/elijah-moore) left in the second quarter with a head injury. He caught an 8-yard touchdown from quarterback [Joe Flacco](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11252/joe-flacco) earlier in the quarter. In Sunday's win over the [Houston Texans](/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans), Cooper broke the Browns receiving record with 265 yards. He also had two touchdowns. Cooper is sixth in the NFL with 1,250 yards receiving despite playing with four different quarterbacks. He also has 72 receptions and five touchdowns. Cleveland (11-5) clinched a berth in the AFC playoffs for the third time since returning to the NFL in 1999.",

    "text": "Werenski expected to miss weeks with lower-body injury\nColumbus Blue Jackets defenseman Zach Werenski is expected to be sidelined week-to-week after an awkward collision with Ondrej Palat forced him out of Wednesday's loss to the New Jersey Devils.\n\"He's still being evaluated by our docs,\" Blue Jackets head coach Pascal Vincent said, per\nNHL.com. \"It's not going to be day-to-day, most likely. I'm sure it's going to be week-to-week now. How many weeks? I don't know.\"\nWerenski leads the Blue Jackets with 25 points this season while also averaging more than 24 minutes per contest. He missed two contests earlier in the year after a knee-on-knee collision and was limited to only 13 games last season due to a shoulder injury.\nColumbus drafted Werenski eighth overall in 2015. He's produced 270 points in 450 career games since breaking into the NHL as a 19-year-old.\nHEADLINES\n[Hughes: Canucks can't 'put our feet up' despite hot start](/nhl/news/2805783/hughes-canucks-cant-put-our-feet-up-despite-hot-start) [Year in photos: 33 of the best sports snapshots of 2023](/us_fed/news/2788215/year-in-photos-33-of-the-best-sports-snapshots-of-2023) [NHL weekly betting guide: Evaluating the ghosts of pre-Christmas games past](/nhl/news/2791086/nhl-weekly-betting-guide-evaluating-the-ghosts-of-pre-christmas-games-past) [Capitals officially sign Ethan Bear to 2-year deal](/nhl/news/2805919/capitals-officially-sign-ethan-bear-to-2-year-deal) [Sabres' Thompson placed on non-roster list for personal reasons](/nhl/news/2805732/sabres-thompson-placed-on-non-roster-list-for-personal-reasons)",

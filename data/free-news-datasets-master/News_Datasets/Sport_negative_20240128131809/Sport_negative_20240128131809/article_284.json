    "text": "Expulsion of the star goalkeeper unbalanced the game for the visitors, who in just a few minutes achieved the turnaround and thrashing numbers in Reboleira In a flash, everything changed drastically in Reboleira, in a game that remained balanced and with the result registering an equality and would end up dictating a rout that, until then, at no point seemed to be foreseen in the history of the first clash between Estrela da Amadora and Arouca , but which would be 4-1 in favor of the wolves of Serra de Freita. The home team went into the break with an advantage thanks to an effective use of the dead ball, more precisely a corner taken precisely for Kialonda Gaspar to drive in, in the 11th minute. However, the second half would prove to be very different, with Arouca coming in better and needing just over two minutes to equalise, with a finish from Rafa Mujica’s first touch, which motivated the visiting team to seek victory. turnaround until Wagner ruined everything. Moments after handling a cross, Estrela’s goalkeeper touched Mujica’s face, in a gesture that the refereeing team sanctioned as aggression, leading to his immediate expulsion and awarding a penalty. From then on, another game was watched at Reboleira. Debutant Edmilson would even defend the maximum punishment moments later, but would not prevent the home team’s collapse from then on, in a mix of galvanization on the part of Arouca, who saw themselves in numerical superiority with around twenty minutes to play, and emotional lack of control by Estrela, who were outnumbered and disorganized and ended up being punished not only with a comeback, but also with a rout in the final minutes. In the 77th minute, Jason made it 1-2, following an incomplete save by Edmilson, and Estrela would not be able to react again, taking advantage of Arouca who scored twice more. First, in a new top-up, this time by Javi Montero, after a ball defended by the home keeper to the post, and already in added time, at 90+1, by Bukia, with ease in the face of a star defensive line that was already committed to the your misfortune on tonight’s date. With the robust result achieved, Arouca reached ninth place and precisely Estrela da Amadora – just like Casa Pia and Boavista, who will still compete in the matches related to this journey -, remaining undefeated since Daniel Sousa’s arrival at the club. technical command. 90+1′: Golo do Arouca! Andre Bukia, just introduced, finished easily after being assisted by Cristo González who, as in the previous goal, took advantage of the lack of concentration in the opposing defense to score the goal. Additional time: 7 minutes. 87′: Double substitution at Arouca, with the entry of Yusuf Lawal and Pedro Santos following the departure of David Simão and Morlaye Sylla. 85′: Double substitution at Arouca, with Michel and Andre Bukia replacing Jason Remeseiro and Rafa Mújica. 80′: Arouca goal! Javi Montero appeared opportunely in reloading Edmilson’s defense to the post, confirming the 3-1 and practically sentencing the victory for the visitors. 77′: Golo do Arouca! A situation of motivated attack in the face of an uneasy defense due to recent events. Cristo González overtook several opponents and risked a shot, which was incompletely saved by Edmilson, allowing Jason Remeseiro to reload. 75′: Cristo González wastes the penalty that followed, allowing the save to Edmilson, the goalkeeper who had entered the game seconds before and also blocked the rebound as best he could. 74′: Double substitution at Estrela da Amadora, with the entry of Edmilson and Kikas following the departure of Ronald and André Luiz. Judge João Pinheiro considered Wagner Dida’s action to be an aggression, after handling a cross taken from the right, he touched Rafa Mújica’s face and therefore provoked a penalty. 71′: Red card for Wagner Dida (Estrela da Amadora). 66′: Replacement at Estrela da Amadora, with the entry of Pedro Sá and the departure of João Reis. 66′: Yellow card for Morlaye Sylla (Arouca). 58′: Double substitution at Estrela da Amadora, with the entry of Manuel Keliano and Ronaldo Tavares following the departure of Vitó and Léo Jabá. Everything was done well in Arouca’s goal: both Tiago Esgaio’s first-time cross and Mújica’s clinical finish. 47′: Golo do Arouca! Rafa Mújica, who had already successfully targeted the opponent’s goal in the first half – but failed – this time finished well and materialized a reaction from the visiting team that already deserved equality. Start of the second part Estrela da Amadora starts the second half with an advantage and in possession of the ball. Interval! Estrela da Amadora 1, Arouca 0 Kialonda Gaspar’s stunning header, following a good entry into the game by Estrela da Amadora, decided the match in favor of the tricolors at half-time. Arouca tried to react and equalize and had good situations to do so, first with a ball on the woodwork by Jason Remeseiro, and then with a goal invalidated by Rafa Mújica for a charge on the Estrela goalkeeper. The visitors were therefore unable to shoot and will try to do so in the second 45 minutes. 45+1: Tiago Esgaio appears in the reload after a previous block by Estrela’s defense, but shot over the top. Additional time: 5 minutes. 40′: Yellow card for Rafa Mújica (Arouca). 39′: Arouca manages to put the ball in the back of the net, in an aerial dispute between Rafa Mújica and Wagner, but the move was invalidated by the Spanish striker’s attack on the Estrela goalkeeper. 32′: Arouca this time very close to a draw! Jason Remeseiro, who has been one of the most unconformist members of the visitors, received the ball lying to the right and shot at the crossbar, with the ball still hitting the pitch in an area close to the goal, but not going in. 31′: André Luiz again creates danger, but wastes it: good individual movement from the Brazilian, from outside to inside, before shooting from the edge of the area, but just over the crossbar. 29′: Estrela returns to targeting the opponent’s goal after the good initial period, which earned him the goal. This time, Léo Cordeiro was unable to create any problems at the opponent’s goal, shooting wide. 27′: With no space to penetrate the star’s area – Kialonda Gaspar has been intractable so far in leading the local defense – Arouca seeks to use the mid-range, through Morlaye Sylla. The Guinea Conakry [international](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/international/)’s shot went just wide, but was always controlled by Wagner. 23′: Again Christ, but also without precision in taking a direct free kick in the frontal zone. The ball went very high. 20′: Arouca’s first attempt to react to the disadvantage, but without danger. Cristo González looked for a shot at the edge of the area, but it was weak and towards Wagner. 12′: Golo do Star from Amadora! The tricolors took the lead through a corner taken from the right by Jean Felipe into the heart of the area and through Kialonda Gaspar, who rose higher than the entire visiting defense and launched the party in Reboleira. 5′: First dangerous situation of the meeting, and immediately blatant! Good work from Léo Jabá on the right, followed by a precise cross for André Luiz, who shot first time and just over the top when he was in a position to do better. Start of the match! The first possession of the ball belonged to Arouca, who presented themselves with their traditional kit – yellow shirt and blue shorts -, just like Estrela da Amadora, in tricolor: red, white and green. The two teams enter the field, accompanied by the Estrela da Amadora anthem. The three teams conclude the warm-up period on the José Gomes Stadium pitch; the refereeing team and Arouca have already retired to the changing rooms, while Estrela is still carrying out exercises in the midfield allocated to them. Less than half an hour before the opening whistle, the stands at Estádio José Gomes are already beginning to look well composed, a situation worth noting considering that the match takes place in the evening on a Thursday, in uninviting temperatures. It seems that the assistance at Reboleira will not disappoint… Coach of Arouca: Daniel Sousa. Arouca substitutes: João Valido, Yusuf Lawal, Trezza, Puche, Matías, Michel, Andre Bukia, Vitinho and Pedro Santos. AROUCA: Ignacio de Arruabarrena, Bogdan Milovanov, Javi Montero, Nino Galovic and Bogdan Milovanov; Eboué Kouassi, Morlaye Sylla and David Simon (c); Christ Gonzalez, Jason Remeseiro and Rafa Music. Referee: João Pinheiro (AF Braga); Assistants: Bruno Jesus and Luciano Maia; 4th Referee: Pedro Ramalho (AF Évora); WAS: Rui Costa (AF Porto); AVAR: Nuno Manso (AF Braga). Estrela da Amadora Coach: Sergio Vieira. Substitutes for Star from Amadora: Edmilson, Ronaldo Tavares, Gustavo Henrique, Pedro Sa, Manuel Keliano, Kikas, Ndour and Manuel Figueiredo. STAR FROM AMADORA: Wagner Dida, Kialonda Gaspar, Erivaldo Almeida and Nkanyiso Shinga; Jean Felipe, Leo Cordeiro, Vito and Joan Reis: Leo Jaba, Ronald Pereira and Andre Luiz. There are already initial teams! The team that travels from Serra de Freita enters the field with just one more point than the penultimate placed team, divided between Vizela, Rio Ave and Gil Vicente, but could finish as ninth placed, equal on points precisely with their opponent for tonight. , Estrela, as well as Casa Pia and Boavista, who have 16 points at the start of this round. Arouca is also going through a good moment, having not yet suffered any setbacks since the change in technical command; the whiplash resulting from Daniel Sousa’s entry seems to have fully paid off, with two wins and two draws and the last defeat increasingly distant, a month and a half ago…. and the prospect of a victory in the first visit in its history to the José Gomes Stadium could enable a significant jump in the league table. Given this ability to keep the team stable despite the physical constraints that have plagued the squad, the Reboleira emblem is positioned in a comfortable ninth place and just two points behind the seventh placed team, Famalicão, who this Friday will have a complicated trip to Estádio da Luz to face Benfica. Despite having been invariably forced to make changes to its starting eleven over the last month due to injuries, which have reached more than a dozen athletes and currently number around eight, Estrela has not lost for over a month, in a a meeting in which, in fact, they even tied in regular time, having been defeated after extra time by Vizela and consequently removed from the Portuguese Cup. As far as defeats in regular time are concerned, Estrela hasn’t officially lost in over a month and a half. Estrela da Amadora and Arouca will look to say goodbye to the 2023 calendar year with a victory. In the case of the Tricolores, if confirmed, it would represent the fourth consecutive match without losing, an achievement worthy of note taking into account the large number of injuries that have affected the star squad. The José Gomes Stadium, in Reboleira, will host an unprecedented duel in national [football](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/football/) this Thursday night (8.15 pm): Estrela da Amadora and Arouca have never met at an official level before and will face each other for the first time in an important contest for the 15th round of the League.

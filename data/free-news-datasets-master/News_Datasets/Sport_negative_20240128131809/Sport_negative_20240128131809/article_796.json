    "text": "Arsenal Lose Their Unbeaten Home Record Against West Ham The Gunners had some aim trouble and fell 2-0 against West Ham United, who knew how to seize and maximize their chances to beat the second-placed team overall.\nDespite holding 74% possession throughout the game and taking over 20 shots, with 8 on target, Arsenal couldn't keep their streak of not losing at home. Despite their dominance on the stat sheet, they couldn't get past the opposing goalkeeper.\nDavid Moyes' team made the most of their 26% possession, turning it into 2 shots on target that ended up in goals (the third shot was a penalty stopped by David Raya), thus breaking Arsenal's home unbeaten run and closing in on the top spot in the Premier League.\nWith this outcome, Arsenal remains in second place on the table, but the leader pulls 2 points further away. Also, with City having a game in hand, they could catch up to Arsenal in points, while Aston Villa might overtake them to share the lead. On the flip side, West Ham, with Spurs' loss, closes the gap to 3 points for the European spots and moves 2 points clear of Manchester United, their closest pursuer.",

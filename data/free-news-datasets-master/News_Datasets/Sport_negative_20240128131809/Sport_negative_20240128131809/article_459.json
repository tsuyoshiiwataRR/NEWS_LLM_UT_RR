    "text": "It surely could not have been\na pleasant holiday weekend for any San Francisco Giants fans who have Dodgers fans in the family. Not after both Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the top two free agents this offseason whom the Giants pursued heavily, landed with their hated archrivals in Los Angeles this month.\nBut in case the sting of those moves was starting to wear off a bit after Christmas, Wednesday gave Giants fans some fresh wounds to lick, courtesy of Yamamoto’s agent Joel Wolfe.\nAt the Dodgers’ introductory press conference for Yamamoto, Wolfe told the media\nhow close the Giants really came to signing his client.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n“He thought that San Francisco really reminded him of Osaka and thought it was a beautiful city,” Wolfe\ntold reporters in Los Angeles of Yamamoto, the former star of the Osaka, Japan-based Orix Buffaloes.\n“If the Dodgers had not been pursuing him, there was a good chance San Francisco could have been his destination,” Wolfe added.\nWolfe also said that one of the clubs courting Yamamoto presented him with a “\nteam-issued javelin” as a gift, one of several he was reportedly given. On the surface, it’s a delightfully weird move. But Yamamoto has used a toy javelin in a warmup routine before, so this mystery team surely was hoping for the gift to be a sign of their depth of interest in Yamamoto.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nCould the Giants have been this mystery javelin gift-giving team? It’s hard to say yes with any certainty, but they do have a strong javelin connection in their history: Former Giants manager Felipe Alou was\na renowned javelin thrower in the Dominican Republic before he signed with the Giants in 1955. Alou is still a part of the organization as a special assistant to baseball operations… if you’re willing to galaxy-brain things, you can make it work.\nBut gift or not, it sure seems like the Giants never truly had\na shot at Yamamoto, the right-hander who has drawn comparisons to Tim Lincecum. On Wednesday, Yamamoto said the Dodgers signing Ohtani was not the top reason he signed with Los Angeles.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n“I wouldn’t say [Ohtani] was the sole reason in deciding to come here, and if he went somewhere else, I probably would have still ended up in LA,” Yamamoto\nsaid through his interpreter on Wednesday. “Winning now and winning into the future was probably the most important thing in making this decision.”\nThe Athletic’s Giants beat reporter Andrew Baggarly had\nmade it clear just how strongly the Giants and president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi were pursuing Yamamoto. “There’s no numbing the pain if they fall short in the Yamamoto pursuit,” Baggarly wrote on Dec. 20. “According to those familiar with Zaidi’s thinking, he has never been so all-in on a free agent in his six years while leading the Giants’ baseball operations group.”\nThe excuses could be plentiful as to why the Giants keep falling short in their pursuits of the top free agents:\nthe ballpark, the city of San Francisco itself, their ownership. Zaidi hasn’t spoken to the media since Yamamoto’s decision became public Friday, so it’s unclear where the Giants’ final offer ended up compared to the 12-year, $325 million deal Yamamoto signed with the Dodgers (who will also pay a posting fee of more than $50 million to his former team).\nBut truly, no matter how heigh the Giants’ interest was, they\naren’t competing with their eternal rivals right now on the field — and that’s leading to them losing in these big moves off the field, too.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n—\nJung-hoo Lee is already helping the Giants. Now, the Giants need to help him.\n—\nMitch Haniger, Alex Cobb among Giants who will reportedly earn more than Shohei Ohtani in 2024\n—\nThe unlikely location of Duane Kuiper's last homer in an SF Giants uniform? Prison.\n—\nSF Giants owner Greg Johnson's 'somewhat break even' quote is enraging for fans",

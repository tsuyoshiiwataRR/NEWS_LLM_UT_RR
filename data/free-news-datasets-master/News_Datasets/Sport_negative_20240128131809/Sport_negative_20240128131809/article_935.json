Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods Elijah Moore suffered a scary injury for the Cleveland Browns against the New York Jets on Thursday Night Football. It looked like an innocuous play as the wide receiver was tackled after a catch and run during the two-minute warning in the first half.\nBut his head slammed into the ground and he did not get up immediately. As the cameras zoomed in, showing his helmet having picked up a divot of the turf, he was seen making what looked like involuntary movements. It was immediately clear that it was serious and the play was stopped for more than a minute as the medical staff attended to him. Players from both teams, especially given Elijah Moore is a former Jets player, huddled on their knees around him.\nNote: Some can find the below video distressing, viewer discretion is advised\nâ€¢\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now Expand Tweet Elijah Moore's injury update Elijah Moore, thankfully, could get up and walk on his own to the blue tent to be evaluated. But it was later confirmed that the head injury he suffered was enough to remove his involvement in the game.\nExpand Tweet It's tough news for the Browns, given they already have Amari Cooper missing. If Elijah Moore misses more time due to concussion protocol, it could have a detrimental effect on their offense.\nFormer Jets combine to bring joy to the Browns on TNF The loss of Elijah Moore came at a time when the Browns were dominant against the Jets. They were already leading 27-17, and soon it was 34-17.\nOne of the touchdowns was scored by the wide receiver from a pass from Joe Flacco . Both these players were with the New York Jets last season. In a retooled offense after acquiring Aaron Rodgers from the Green Bay Packers , they were deemed dispensable.\nYet, it is Cleveland that is on the way to the postseason. It is sweet revenge for the ex-Jets players but scoring when playing against them would have been the cherry on the top.\nWorryingly for the Browns, though, their injuries are now racking up. It is not just they are now down two of their best receivers for this game and maybe more, but it is all around. Joe Flacco is, of course, playing in place of Deshaun Watson , who is out for the season.\nAdditionally, after kicker Dustin Hopkins was injured in the game against the Houston Texans , they acquired Riley Patterson who missed both a field goal and a one-point conversion today. Their punter was also injured in the previous week. They are limping toward the postseason and they could catch up in the playoffs.",

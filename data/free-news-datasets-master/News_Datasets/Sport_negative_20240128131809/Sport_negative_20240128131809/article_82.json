    "text": "On this evidence there is one team that should be challenging for a Champions League place. And it is not Tottenham Hotspur . Brighton were simply brilliant and fully deserving of a victory that capped an incredible 2023 and strengthened their own hopes of once again qualifying for European football. But Tottenham? They could have gone back above Manchester City and into fourth with a win but it felt like a game too many as they limp towards the transfer window opening and with head coach Ange Postecoglou already making it plain that he needs reinforcements. There has been so much praise, and rightly so, for Postecoglou but he needs help. Ange-ball cannot succeed with this personnel on an evening when the magic wore off a little. There was a hugely-impressive late rally, with two goals that distorted Brighton‚Äôs dominance and even the glimmer of an incredible, improbable comeback. But do not be fooled. Brighton absolutely deserved this and more. There were no excuses. Spurs were missing a host of players but Brighton, a club with fewer resources, could top that. They had even more out and had to make more changes. Follow latest reaction below... 10:04 PM GMT Happy night for Brighton fans LOVE this team! üíô [pic.twitter.com/WKtJGxjCG9] ‚Äî Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) [December 28, 2023] 09:58 PM GMT Good year for Brighton 2023 has been a great year for Brighton üôå [pic.twitter.com/Tm2QfxJUJU] ‚Äî Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) [December 28, 2023] 09:57 PM GMT Tottenham‚Äôs Son Heung-min speaking to PLP ‚ÄúIt is a very disappointing performance. This is not how we‚Äôve approached the season. This performance was nowhere near the level we want to play at. We know what our mistakes were but now is not the time to point fingers at each other because the games are coming fast. ‚ÄúWe have to talk about the first half and the early parts of the second half rather than the end. We know we have to play like that from minute one. We have to take the lesson again and move on. Every team is strong in the Premier League and if we‚Äôre not playing like the last 15 minutes in every game we‚Äôre going to struggle and this has to be a big wake-up call. ‚ÄúBefore they scored the goal we had good pressures and a couple of actions where we could have done better. Brighton were more clinical than us and then the penalties caused big problems for us. We have to be more focused on the penalty, it is a big detail. The first half was not our game and not us. We have to take a big, big session.‚Äù 09:54 PM GMT Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou speaking to the BBC ‚ÄúIt is fair to say we looked like a tired team today, which is understandable. We‚Äôve asked a lot of these players for a very long time and we lacked a little bit of energy today. They are a good team and we struggled to cope with them. We hung in there and that‚Äôs all you can ask for, they left everything out there. ‚ÄúThere are no grumbles from me with the penalties. They were clear and obvious. It‚Äôs amazing that VAR picks up everything apart from a tackle that maybe puts out another of our players. ‚ÄúThere were positives at the end this group of players are giving everything at the moment. It is demanding to play the football we ask and they are doing it week in week out. It‚Äôs not for a lack of effort. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt been able to give the players a break at all and what we ask is pretty taxing.‚Äù 09:49 PM GMT Brighton striker Danny Welbeck speaking to Amazon Prime On Pervis Estupi√±√°n‚Äôs goal: ‚ÄúIt was incredible. We‚Äôve given him a bit of stick because he‚Äôs taken a few opportunities where he has struck the ball from distance but today was incredible. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been out for a while and everybody is over the moon for him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to get the technique right first and foremost and I think once the ball left his boot he knew that was in. It was a beautiful goal, and one he will remember forever.‚Äù On Brighton‚Äôs 2023: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been incredible. One that not many would have foresaw coming. We‚Äôve done well and set the standards of where we want to be and we can only build upon that now. We want more, we have hungry people within the club and we want to keep on getting better and better. ‚ÄúEven today we won 4-2 but we‚Äôre still disappointed for conceding two goals. There is always room for improvement.‚Äù 09:48 PM GMT Nervy ending for Brighton? When Brighton went 4-0 up with 15 minutes to go, all of their fans must have relaxed knowing the three points was absolutely guaranteed. But there were some nerves inside the AMEX when Tottenham got two goals back and they probably should have got at least a third in added time. Never in doubt‚Ä¶ üòÖ [pic.twitter.com/NfTmnpU1hk] ‚Äî Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) [December 28, 2023] 09:44 PM GMT Leaking goals 19 - Since the start of November, Spurs have conceded the joint-most goals in the Premier League (19, along with [Nottingham Forest]), while they have the highest xG against total in this period (21.4).

When they went 4-0 up with 15 minutes to go they thought it would be the easiest of finishes to the game but it ended up being a nervy ending as Tottenham got two goals back.

Another chance in added time there for Tottenham. 09:27 PM GMT 90+5 minutes: Brighton 4 Tottenham 2 Hojbjerg hits the post and then Porro ‚Äôs shot is blocked by Estupinan for a corner which is headed away. Tottenham could have easily brought it back to 4-3 there. 09:26 PM GMT 90+4 minutes: Brighton 4 Tottenham 2 It is all Tottenham at the moment and Brighton are hanging on, counting down the minutes. 09:25 PM GMT 90+3 minutes: Brighton 4 Tottenham 2 Lallana is going to come on for Brighton in place of Pedro. Dunk is back up and running. 09:24 PM GMT 90+1 minutes: Brighton 4 Tottenham 2 Veliz turns really well inside Brighton‚Äôs box but his shot is blocked. Kulusevski then has shot from the edge of the box but it does not trouble the Brighton goal. Dunk has gone down with some cramp. 09:23 PM GMT 90 minutes: Brighton 4 Tottenham 2 There will be nine minutes of added time at the end of this crazy match. Brighton are looking so nervy again and Tottenham are on the attack again inside the Brighton box, but Gil chooses the wrong option. 09:22 PM GMT 89 minutes: Brighton 4 Tottenham 2 Son goes down in the Brighton box wanting a penalty after contact with Estupinan but that is never going to be given a penalty. Moments later Tottenham want another penalty for handball but nothing given again. 09:20 PM GMT 88 minutes: Brighton 4 Tottenham 2 Tottenham have a free-kick on the left around 30 yards out but Porro‚Äôs delivery is a very poor one. It has way too much on it and goes out for a goal-kick. 09:18 PM GMT Goal stands Davies was just onside so it is now 4-2. 09:18 PM GMT GOAL! Davies gets another one back Is this game truly dead? You would imagine so but Tottenham have got a second. Porro plays a delightful ball to the far post and Davies heads home. VAR will check this as it was very close to being offside... 09:16 PM GMT 82 minutes: Brighton 4 Tottenham 1 Since the goal was scored Kulusevski has been down receiving treatment. In winning the ball from Dunk Kulusevski was caught. It looks awful when you slow it down but it is not as bad as the slow-motion replays make it appear. Dunk is now banned for Brighton‚Äôs next game against West Ham . 09:14 PM GMT GOAL! Veliz gets goal back for Tottenham Tottenham get a goal back. Dunk is dispossessed by Kulusevski deep in his own half and Son has it in the Brighton box. Instead of shooting he finds Veliz at the back post. He takes one touch and then sneaks it into the near post for his first goal for Tottenham. Tottenham gets one back! Alejo Veliz scores his first goal for Spurs üëÄ [#PLonPrime] [#BHATOT] [pic.twitter.com/aaAxqj6tyq] ‚Äî Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) [December 28, 2023] 09:10 PM GMT 78 minutes: Brighton 4 Tottenham 0 Porro is very lucky not to be booked for a late challenge on Pedro. 09:09 PM GMT GOAL! Pedro scores second from the spot Like in the first half he sends Vicario the wrong way and slots into the right corner to make it 4-0. That is the eighth penalty he has scored this season. Joao Pedro with an ice-cold finish from the spot ü•∂ That's his 2nd penalty of the night and his 8th penalty goal this season ‚öΩÔ∏è [#PLonPrime] [#BHATOT] [pic.twitter.com/K9z9cmsj24] ‚Äî Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) [December 28, 2023] 09:06 PM GMT Penalty to Brighton Brighton are going to have the chance to make it 4-0. Ferguson has the ball in the Tottenham box and Lo Celso gets none of the ball coming from behind and Jarred Gillett is in no doubt giving the penalty. Pedro to take the penalty... 09:03 PM GMT 71 minutes: Brighton 3 Tottenham 0 Not long after coming on Moder is booked for blocking Tottenham from taking a quick free-kick. 09:02 PM GMT 70 minutes: Brighton 3 Tottenham 0 It is substitution central as Veliz has come on for Tottenham in place of Johnson. 09:00 PM GMT 68 minutes: Brighton 3 Tottenham 0 Roberto de Zerbi is making a double change himself as Ferguson and Moder come on for Welbeck and Milner . 08:58 PM GMT 65 minutes: Brighton 3 Tottenham 0 After that goal, Ange Postecoglou made a double change as Sarr and Richarlison came off for Lo Celso and Gil. 08:56 PM GMT GOAL! Estupinan with stunner WHAT A GOAL! On his return from injury Estupinan scores a stunner. From around 25 yards out he fires a bullet into the top right-hand corner. Vicario had no chance. Brighton 3-0 up and that should be game, set and match. What a hit from Estupi√±√°n! üöÄ On his first game back from injury, the Ecuadorian scores a screamer! üí• [#PLonPrime] [#BHATOT] [pic.twitter.com/c2ZbDh6gpt] ‚Äî Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) [December 28, 2023] 08:55 PM GMT Goal ruled out For the second time in this second half, Richarlison thinks he has got a goal back for Tottenham. Kulusevski feeds a cute ball through to Richarlison and he slots home past Steele, but the offside flag is up. Good decision from the linesman as replays show the Brazilian was offside. 08:51 PM GMT 59 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 Roberto de Zerbi makes his second change of the night as Baleba replaces Buonanotte . 08:50 PM GMT 58 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 VAR did check a possible handball from Richarlison inside his own penalty area but nothing given. 08:50 PM GMT 57 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 Son goes down way too easily inside the Brighton box and wants a penalty but that is never a penalty. Moments later Richarlison is booked for a foul on Pedro, who went down rolling around holding his face. There was contact near Pedro‚Äôs face but there was not that much contact. 08:48 PM GMT 55 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 Udogie should score. He finds himself inside the Brighton box and his first effort is blocked and then his second is saved. 08:46 PM GMT 54 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 So close for Richarlison. Brighton lose possession deep in their own half and the ball is fed into Richarlison. He takes one touch, swivels and tries to find the far corner but it goes whiskers wide of the post. He should have hit the target. Moments later the Brazilian has a shot saved but he was offside. 08:43 PM GMT 51 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 Milner tries to find Welbeck with a low-drilled cross but Vicario smothers it. At the other end Johnson tries to find Son at the back post but his cross never reaches him. 08:41 PM GMT 49 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 Brighton have the first corner of the second half. Milner to take an inswinger from the left. He swings it in and Vicario tries to punch it away but looks very unconvincing. He flaps at it and it goes behind for another Brighton corner. Three corners now in succession for Brighton but the third is headed away by Tottenham. 08:38 PM GMT Goal ruled out Richarlison thinks he has got a goal back inside the first minute of the second half but he was clearly offside and the flag went up early. 08:37 PM GMT Second half We are back under way at the AMEX Stadium. Brighton have made a change at the break as Igor is replaced by Estupinan, who is back from injury tonight. 08:29 PM GMT Teenage goals 19 - Brighton have scored 19 goals via teenage players in the Premier League in 2023; more than every other team to have played in the competition this year combined (16). Fearless. [pic.twitter.com/4a7VFmrtAg] ‚Äî OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) [December 28, 2023] 08:21 PM GMT Half-time Son tries to find the far corner from the edge of the box but his effort just goes wide.

Porro takes it from the left but Pedro gets his head on it first. 08:18 PM GMT 45+1 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 Tottenham could have got a goal back. Richarlison takes a first-time hit from the edge of the box and it strikes the outside of the post. The shot was always curling wide. 08:17 PM GMT 45 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 Brighton should be 3-0 up. Porro‚Äôs terrible misplaced pass gives Pedro a free run at Tottenham‚Äôs goal. A poor touch puts him slightly wider and he tries to chip Vicario. The Tottenham goalkeeper gets a touch on it to push it wide. Pedro should have scored. There will be five minutes of added time at the end of this first half. A huge save from Vicario! üß§ Joao Pedro comes close to scoring his second of the evening [#PLonPrime] [#BHATOT] [pic.twitter.com/Ax70HqWIns] ‚Äî Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) [December 28, 2023] 08:13 PM GMT 43 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 Buonanotte has been booked for not retreating from a Tottenham free-kick. 08:10 PM GMT 39 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 This game is end-to-end and Tottenham have made a number of entries into the Brighton box. Son has a shot this time but it is blocked. 08:08 PM GMT Goal ruled out Buonanotte thinks he has made it 3-0 to Brighton but the offside flag is immediately up. Welbeck plays a great dinked ball in behind the Tottenham defence and Buonanotte‚Äôs first-time finish is sublime, but he was clearly offside. 08:05 PM GMT 33 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 Huge opportunity missed by Johnson. Porro plays a superb ball forward to Johnson, who is running towards the Brighton goal. His first touch is a poor one and his strike is blocked by Igor. Had his first touch been better he had Richarlison and Son in acres of space to his left. 08:03 PM GMT 32 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 Milner hits the post! Brighton are inches away from making it 3-0. He strikes from the edge of the Tottenham box and his curling effort beats Vicario but comes back off the post. 08:01 PM GMT 30 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 With the yellow card for the penalty incident Kulusevski will now miss Tottenham‚Äôs next game against Bournemouth . 08:00 PM GMT 29 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 Welbeck pressurises Davies high up the pitch and ends up winning Brighton a corner on the right. Gross sends it in but Richarlison heads it away. 07:58 PM GMT 27 minutes: Brighton 2 Tottenham 0 Son goes for goal from the edge of the Brighton box but his effort is deflected behind for a corner. Porro takes but Igor heads it away. Tottenham then come back on the attack and Johnson fires a great ball across the box but Richarlison cannot quite get on the end of it. 07:54 PM GMT GOAL!

Kulusevski was blatantly pulling Welbeck‚Äôs shirt just as the Brighton forward was about to smash the ball inside the six-yard box and it looks like a penalty. 07:51 PM GMT 20 minutes: Brighton 1 Tottenham 0 Brighton have their first corner of the night after Porro blocks Pedro‚Äôs cross. It is swung in by Gross and van Hecke‚Äôs header hits the post. The Brighton players then go nuts appealing for a penalty. VAR is checking... 07:48 PM GMT 17 minutes: Brighton 1 Tottenham 0 Brighton have another chance. The ball is shifted to Pedro on the left-hand side of the penalty area. He cuts inside onto his right and fires at goal but it is straight at Vicario. 07:43 PM GMT GOAL! Hinshelwood gets Brighton's opener Brighton take the lead. Pedro cuts in from the left onto his right and just keeps dribbling across the edge of the box. He feeds it to 18-year-old Hinshelwood on the right in acres of space, who smashes it past Vicario. 1-0 Brighton. Hinshelwood opens the scoring!

The ball falls to Welbeck just inside the Tottenham box and he hits it with his stronger right foot. But Vicario springs to his left to make a diving save. It was a terrific save but Welbeck should have buried that. 07:36 PM GMT 5 minutes: Brighton 0 Tottenham 0 Early chance for Welbeck. He plays a great one-two with Gilmour on the left-hand side of the penalty area and he opens his body up to hit with his right. His shot is saved by Vicario. 07:35 PM GMT 4 minutes: Brighton 0 Tottenham 0 He hits the wall. That was a very poor free-kick. The Brighton wall did its job. 07:34 PM GMT 3 minutes: Brighton 0 Tottenham 0 Tottenham have a free-kick in a dangerous area centrally as Igor Julio takes down Johnson.

Having a bet on today‚Äôs match? First take a look at these free bets and betting offers . 06:05 PM GMT Match preview Brighton manager Roberto de Zerbi has confirmed Kaoru Mitoma and Simon Adingra have been ruled out for a number of weeks due to injury. Brighton take on Tottenham tonight and are already without Ansu Fati, Tariq Lamptey, Adam Webster, Solly March, Julio Enciso and Joel Veltman. ‚ÄúWe have more or less 10 injured players, maybe eight but (the other) two players can‚Äôt start the game. Mitoma is one of them. We lost Kaoru for around six weeks- four, five, six weeks. Adingra, I think he needs four, five weeks recovery. Tonight, no Mitoma, no Adingra.‚Äù Last time out, Brighton drew 1-1 at Crystal Palace. Afterwards, de Zerbi was full of praise for his youngsters, especially Facundo Buonanotte. ‚ÄúThe young players need time to improve, to progress. If you remember Facundo Buonanotte, two or three months ago, he was different than the Facundo today now. ‚ÄúI think he is playing with more energy, with a different attitude, with a different mentality. Now I think he feels able to play, to stay in the Premier League, and two months ago, three months ago, I didn‚Äôt see the same attitude, the same behaviour. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really happy for him, because he is a good guy, he has a right spirit, he has the right character to play. I think he can be important.‚Äù Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou has confirmed Argentina centre-half Cristian Romero will miss up to five weeks with an hamstring injury. Romero joins fellow centre-back Micky van de Ven on the sidelines, who is still a few weeks away from returning from his own hamstring injury. Italy full-back Destiny Udogie is available tonight after returning from a ban but Yves Bissouma will start his own four-game suspension. Tottenham have had the better of Brighton in recent times; they have won eight of the 12 Premier League meetings. If Tottenham win tonight, it will be their third consecutive win in the league against Brighton.",

    "text": "It was almost a moment made for a movie.\nThe\nNBA’s worst team, losers of 27 straight games, takes on the NBA’s best team on its home court, a place it hasn’t lost all season, and slays the dragon, both figuratively and literally.\nIt would have been an inspirational movie for the ages.\nInstead,\nDetroit, the NBA’s worst team, found itself in another horror film, but this one had a sick, sick twist.\nGO DEEPER\nHow the Pistons, one of the NBA's most storied franchises, cratered\nThe Pistons fell to the\nCeltics on Thursday night, 128-122, in overtime after leading by 19 points at halftime. The franchise is now tied for the longest losing streak in NBA history (over two seasons) at 28. Detroit didn’t do anything particularly different through the first 24 minutes. Cade Cunningham made shots like he has been, the defense was OK and the Pistons still turned the ball over way too much. Boston, though, shot a horrid 39 percent from the field and 17 percent from 3 while turning the ball over 10 times. It was the first time in a long time that it felt like an opposing team shot poorly against Detroit.\nAdvertisement\nOnce the Celtics tied the game to end the third quarter, it was a back-and-forth battle the rest of the way. The Pistons briefly trailed by six points late in the fourth quarter but showed some poise late in the game to not crumble in crunch time like thy have most of the season.\nDetroit had several opportunities to take a lead with seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, but veterans\nBojan Bogdanovic and Alec Burks — both of whom shoot better than 38 percent from 3 for their careers — missed multiple wide-open looks.\nGO DEEPER\nWhere does Pistons’ losing streak rank in sports history?\nThe Celtics had a two-point lead with 4.8 seconds left when Bogdanovic cleaned up a Cunningham missed 3-point attempt. Tatum missed a shot at the end of regulation that led to overtime.\nIn the extra period, Boston looked like a team that has played in intense moments before, making shots and playing without mistakes. The Pistons shot under 40 percent from the field and were 1-for-6 from 3.\nDetroit will face the\nRaptors, at home, on Saturday to try and avoid loss No. 29.\nRequired reading\nPistons owner Tom Gores Q&A: On state of franchise, potential changes: ‘We have a problem’ Pistons trade scenarios: Examining what Detroit could do, what I’m hearing Want your NBA team to rebuild?

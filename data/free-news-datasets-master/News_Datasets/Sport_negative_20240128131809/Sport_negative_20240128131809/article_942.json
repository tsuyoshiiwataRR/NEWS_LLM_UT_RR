    "text": "NEW DELHI: India may be forced to forfeit a Davis Cup play-off hosted by Pakistan, with the local tennis association saying Thursday the team was waiting on New Delhi´s approval to travel.\nThe All India Tennis Association (AITA) asked the sports ministry for approval to travel to Pakistan after a request to shift the fixture to a third country was rejected by the International Tennis Federation tribunal. “The proposal is still pending with the ministry and we are awaiting a decision,” AITA secretary-general Anil Dhupar told foreign media.\nPakistan Tennis Federation president Salim Saifullah Khan said 18 members of the Indian squad had requested visas for the World Group 1 clash scheduled for February 3-4. “We have all the arrangements put in place. They will be given the best security and accommodation,” he told AFP. “Let politics be kept away from sports and better sense prevail.”\nNew Delhi last hosted the Pakistani tennis team in 2006 and the Indian Davis Cup team last travelled to Islamabad in 1964, according to Indian media. Local media reports said a 2019 match was moved to Kazakhstan, with the AITA citing political tensions as the reason for the request.\nSports matches between India and Pakistan are rare owing to decades of hostility between the two nations. They share one of the world´s great sporting rivalries in cricket, by far the most popular sport in both countries.\nBut their teams have not played a bilateral series in more than a decade, and typically only face each other in larger tournaments. India refused to travel to Pakistan for the 50-over Asia Cup in September, a move that forced its neighbour to partially relinquish hosting duties to Sri Lanka.\nPakistan travelled to India the following month for the Cricket World Cup after its request to stage some matches in a third country was rejected.\nISLAMABAD: The world may not witness reasonable GDP growth in 2024; rather, it will continue to experience lower...\nCommerce minister Gohar Ejaz said measures envisaged by Special Investment Facilitation Council would start a new...\nISLAMABAD: The flight operation has been badly affected by thick fog as 40 flights were canceled and dozens delayed in...\nPESHAWAR: The Election Commission of Pakistan has released a list of 37 politicians, including former prime minister...\nISLAMABAD: Former Chief Justice Jawwad S.

    "text": "Mikel Arteta can still look down from the top of the Premier League table at the start of 2024 if Arsenal win their next match, at Fulham on New Year’s Eve (Saturday). That's because current leaders Liverpool, who have 42 points, do not play again until 1 January when Newcastle visit Anfield. Whatever they do against Fulham will make up for the manner of this defeat.\nThe best team lost, but Arsenal, as so often in the past 20 years, were their own worst enemy. Chance after chance went begging as they either tried to walk the ball into the net or suffered from poor finishing and a lack of an out-and-out goalscorer in their squad.\nLosing to in-form London rivals West Ham is not enough on its own to make an argument they are not good or mentally strong enough to withstand the onslaught coming from a surging Liverpool and defending champions Manchester City finding their mojo, but there were a few tells in the manner of their defeat that offered causes for concern.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and his Anfield side will have been watching and celebrating, so will Pep Guardiola and his City men. And rightly so.\nHad Arsenal won, as most experts predicted, they would have had the destination of the title in their own hands at the halfway mark. Victory, however unlikely, in all of their remaining 19 games would have meant the 20th anniversary celebrations of their 2004 Invincibles season in May would be marked by their first Premier League title since that history-making campaign. What a party that will be!\nHow ironic that West Ham’s decisive second goal was scored by Dino Mavropanos, a player Arsenal’s architect of success two decades ago, Arsene Wenger, signed in the hope he would be a mainstay of Arsenal’s future title-chasing squads. That prospect did not work out on any level.\nNow it looks like the end of this season will still be very much one of celebrating the ghosts of glories past whilst haunted by the errors that conceded their advantage in this season’s title race.\nArteta, most of his players and the club's supporters have been before. Only last season, to be precise, when they looked like ending City’s stranglehold on the English game only to surrender an eight-point lead going into April It is largely why the atmosphere here was and has been tense rather than celebratory in most matches to date this season.\nThis London derby was no different. The unseasonably late 8.15 pm kick-off and Twixtmas fixture date - neither Christmas nor New Year vibes - was played in an atmosphere of fear from the moment West Ham took a controversial early lead. Their previous two defeats of the season, away to Newcastle and Aston Villa, also came in matches they had enough chances to win the day, but they still lack the necessary killer instinct.\nMaybe that is the reason Arsenal why Arsenal were reluctant to boast about their chances even before this match. They knew their luck had to run out in the shadow of chasing champions City. They are so scarred by the way Guardiola’s side recovered to leave them in their wake last season, there is a sense of inevitability it is going to happen all over again.\nArsenal might yet be starting the New Year at the top of the table but City, for a team that has struggled to play consistently to their best so far have nothing but good memories going into the second half of the season.\nLiverpool too, who come here in just under five weeks to test Arsenal’s title resolve again will relish the occasion. They have seasoned players such as Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Alisson and Trent Alexander Arnold who know what it takes to win the Premier League. They are also on a mission to show they are back to their best and do not have the distraction of Champions League football to hinder them.\nIt was Arsenal, however, certainly before this defeat, who most experts fancied to take City all the way this time. Maybe they will, but it will take a remarkable mental rebuild by Arteta and his staff to get his players believing again.\nThe January transfer window, which opens on Monday, could present some solutions. Arsenal badly need a goalscoring forward, back up in defence and midfield bolstering will not go amiss either. If Thomas Partey and Jurrien Timber are fit again while they are still mathematically in the race it will no doubt boost their chances too, but will that mend the damage of the nature of this defeat?\nThey seemed scared of their own shadows at times. Scared to shot, scared to gamble and scared to take responsibility. Maybe they are just scared of Liverpool and City. Football fortunes and fans are as fickle as they come, so I might be wrong, but this felt like a hugely significant evening.\nThe ultimate insult came from the West Ham fans as they jeered off their former favourite son Declan Rice, the 100million man who switched teams in the summer in the pursuit of silverware. ‘You should have signed for a big club’ they sang after he conceded an injury-time penalty to gift the visitors their chance of a third goal.",

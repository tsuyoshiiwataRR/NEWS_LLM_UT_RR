    "text": "Florida starting OL going back in transfer portal after 1 season at UF Florida continues to receive bad news when it comes to the transfer portal. Another starter has reportedly entered his name into the portal on Thursday. Starting guard Micah Mazzccua will enter the portal after one season in Gainesville. Florida starting offensive guard Micah Mazzccua is expected to enter the transfer portal, a source tells [@247sports]. Mazzccua was a standout guard at Baylor before transferring to Florida last year. [https://t.co/qgXqEAp4Fr] [pic.twitter.com/8N2MfajT8Z] â€” Matt Zenitz (@mzenitz) [December 29, 2023] Mazzccua was a standout guard for the Baylor Bears before transferring to the Gators for the 2023 season. Mazzccua started 11 of 12 games at right guard for the Gators in 2023. Mazzccua is the 19th player to enter the portal for the Gators in 2023. Fellow standouts Princely Umanmielen, Trevor Etienne, and Will Norman are other notable Gators who went in the portal at the conclusion of the regular season. The Gators have added one offensive lineman thus far. Brandon Crenshaw-Dickson comes to Gainesville from San Diego State and should provide depth to a thin unit. The Gators struggled mightily in pass protection in 2023. The unit finished No. 115 in sacks allowed, giving up 39 on the season. The unit was much better at run blocking as the team averaged just under 150 yards per game on the ground.",

    "text": "Six months at [Arsenal](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/arsenal-fc) are enough to make some [West Ham](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/west-ham-fc) fans forget [Declan Rice](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/declan-rice)'s contributions in east London. The Gunners anchor was pelted with boos every time he touched the ball during the first half at the Emirates on Thursday evening. And the Hammers only grew in their confidence after Tomas Soucek scored a surprise opener thanks to Jarrod Bowen's determined play. But many on social media were incredulous as to how the travelling fans could overlook their former star's stellar work over a decade on their books. Rice, 24, was named West Ham's Player of the Year on three occasions, made 245 appearances for the club and was a pivotal force in [their run to the Europa Conference League title](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/breaking-west-ham-win-conference-30179933) last season.

Another wrote: \"How cringe are the West Ham fans booing Declan Rice everytime he's on the ball. He won you mugs a European trophy, £105million to your club, the chance to rebuild half of your team. . .\" Where will Arsenal finish in the Premier League this season? Let us know in the [comments section](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/west-ham-arsenal-rice-boos-31764755#comments-section) below. That isn't enough for some disciples, however, who refused to let their former talisman off so easily. Nevertheless, Rice enjoyed a positive first half individually, completing 97% of his passes, winning all duels and tackles he attempted. Despite those efforts, West Ham doubled their lead when Konstantinos Mavropanos headed home in the second period. And it was one of those brought in to replace Rice, James Ward-Prowse, who assisted from a corner.

The former [Chelsea](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/chelsea-fc) academy prospect came into the midweek match having already lost to his former club once this season. It was West Ham who sent the Gunners spiralling out of the [Carabao Cup](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/league-cup) in November following a shock 3-1 defeat at London Stadium. [Mikel Arteta](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/mikel-arteta) is convinced his club were right to splurge nine digits on the player, however, and said ahead of Thursday's fixture: \"There were a lot of question marks and that's something you have to overcome because they're going to be looking at every stat and every movement that you make. He's very intelligent to manage that. \"I love his presence on the pitch. He's there and he's got something special. I felt it when I played against him, that's why I was mad to sign him. You get a feeling about players and I wanted him to be part of our team. When they put the price tag you have to carry that and it is not easy. He has done it in a brilliant way.\"",

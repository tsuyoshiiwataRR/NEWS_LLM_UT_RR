    "text": "Manchester United's new signing, Rasmus Hojlund, has been making waves in the football world. Despite facing challenges and receiving less than adequate support from his teammates, he has managed to maintain a cool demeanor on the pitch. This article delves into Paul Parker's bold claim about this rising star and how he compares to Cristiano Ronaldo. Former [Manchester United defender](https://sporticos.com/en-gb/team/england/manchester-united-fc) Paul Parker recently made a bold statement about Hojlund. According to him, despite not getting enough support from his teammates, Hojlund doesn't react with frustration like Ronaldo during his second stint at Old Trafford. Instead of throwing tantrums like some players might do under such circumstances, Hojlund keeps a cool figure on the pitch. Former Manchester United defender, Paul Parker, said: “Everyone hates Manchester United and Rasmus Hojlund. Experts and critics hope that he fails because he plays for the world’s biggest club, which nobody likes. The good thing is that the fans have always supported him, and they will continue to do so.\" \"I think he has been frustrated with his teammates because they don’t provide him with the best conditions to score goals, The good thing about Hojlund is that he doesn’t show it on the field, and he never behaves like a diva, which we have seen especially Cristiano Ronaldo do in the past.\" This is an important trait for any player in the high-pressure environment of professional football. It shows maturity and mental strength that can be crucial in tough matches where emotions run high. Parker also mentioned that people are hoping to see Hojlund struggle at Old Trafford - a common sentiment when new players join big clubs like Manchester United. However, instead of crumbling under pressure or reacting negatively towards these expectations, Rasmus seems aware of them and is determined to rise above them. As United's attack gels and Hojlund scores his first goal, big things are in the works Rasmus finally opened his account in the Premier League by scoring the winning goal in Manchester United's 3-2 comeback victory in the [Aston Villa fixture](https://sporticos.com/en-gb/team/england/aston-villa-fc) on December 26th. This performance not only showcased his skills as a striker but also demonstrated his ability to perform under pressure. Paul Parker believes that expectations will be higher for this young striker going forward after such an impressive performance. But if we consider how he has handled himself so far - keeping calm amidst challenges and delivering results when it matters most - it seems likely that Rasmus will continue impressing both fans and critics alike. Rasmus Hojlund is proving to be a valuable addition to Manchester United. His cool demeanour on the pitch, ability to handle pressure, and knack for scoring crucial goals are traits that make him stand out. As he continues his journey at Old Trafford, it will be interesting to see how he handles the increasing expectations and whether he can continue his impressive form in upcoming [Premier League matches](https://sporticos.com/en-gb/league/england/premier-league). For now, though, it seems like Manchester United has found a new star in Rasmus Hojlund.",

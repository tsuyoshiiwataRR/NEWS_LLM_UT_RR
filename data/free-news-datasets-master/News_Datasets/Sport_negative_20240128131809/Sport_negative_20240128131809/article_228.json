    "text": "Chicago's Connor Bedard tripped over Mark Scheifele's stick Wednesday night Adam Johnson died after a fatal on-ice collision during a game on October 28DailyMail.com provides all the latest international sports news\nChicago Blackhawks star Connor Bedard’s skate almost cut the neck of Winnipeg Jets center Mark Scheifele Wednesday night.\nDuring the Blackhawks’ overtime win, the rookie was caught up in a play that could have had dire consequences after he took a tumble over Scheifele’s stick.\nBedard tried to skate past the Jets’ alternate captain only for his opponent’s stick to get caught in front of him, causing him to lose his balance and topple forward.\nBut as the 18-year-old crashed towards the ground his right leg raised upwards and his skate came alarmingly close to catching Scheifele, who didn’t appear to be wearing a guard, on the neck.\nFortunately, Scheifele was unharmed and Bedard went on to score the winning goal in overtime of the Blackhawks’ 2-1 win.\nNeck guards, anyone?? Anyone?? Okay. So….\n— ParsleyPalace (@ParsleyPalace) December 28, 2023\nBlackhawks star Connor Bedard’s skate almost cut the neck of Jets center Mark Scheifele\nDuring Chicago’s overtime win, the rookie tripped over Scheifele’s stick and fell to the ice\nAdam Johnson died after an opponent’s skate slashed his neck during a game in October\nHowever, the incident raised concerns over player safety, coming just two months after the death of Adam Johnson.\nThe Nottingham Panthers player died at the age of 29 in an on-ice freak accident on October 28 when he was stuck in the neck by an opponent’s skate during a game against the Sheffield Steelers.\nThe tragic incident was witnessed by around 8,000 fans at Sheffield’s Utilita Arena. A man has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.\nThe close-call between Bedard and Scheifele on Wednesday has renewed pleas from fans for players to wear protective equipment.\nEarlier this month, it was announced that neck guards will become compulsory at all International Ice Hockey Federation events including the Olympics and the men’s and women’s world championships.\nBedard went on to score the winner in overtime, sealing the 2-1 win for the Blackhawks\nScheifele, an alternate captain for the Jets, hits the puck past Chicago’s Jason Dickinson\nThe English Ice Hockey Association announced within days of Johnson’s accident at the end of October that neck guards will become compulsory during ‘all on-ice activities’ from the start of 2024.\nNeck guards are not yet compulsory in professional leagues including the NHL, while the IIHF is yet to announce a start date for its new ruling, given delays in procuring the required equipment.\nFollowing the collision, Johnson was taken to hospital and later pronounced dead.\nA post-mortem examination confirmed he had died as a result of a fatal neck injury.\nNeck guards will become compulsory at all International Ice Hockey Federation events including the Olympics after Johnson tragically died on the ice in October\nA man has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter has been released on police bail.\nThe Panthers held a memorial game in honor of Johnson on November 18 at the Motorpoint Arena, which marked the first time the team had taken to the ice since his death.\nNottingham faced Manchester Storm but did not count toward either team’s Elite Ice Hockey League tallies. The game ultimately finished 4-4.\nA Panthers teammate of Johnson, Victor Bjorkung, who was on the ice at the time of the fatal collision left the team weeks after describing the incident as ‘the most traumatizing thing’ he has ever experienced.",

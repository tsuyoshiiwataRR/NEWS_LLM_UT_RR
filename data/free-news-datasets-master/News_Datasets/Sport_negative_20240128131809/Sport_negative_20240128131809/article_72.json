    "text": "Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence missed another practice Thursday, casting doubt about his chances at playing through a shoulder injury Sunday against the Carolina Panthers.\nLawrence, 24, was listed as the Jaguars’ only non-participant. Another seven players were limited, nearly mirroring the team’s injury report Wednesday. The only difference is rookie cornerback Christian Braswell was no longer on the report after reverting to the injured reserve.\nThursday Injury Report pic.twitter.com/E2F8UNaYP1\n— Jacksonville Jaguars (@Jaguars) December 28, 2023\nEarlier in the day Thursday, Jaguars coach Doug Pederson told reporters that Lawrence would likely be limited and “go through our individual portion.”\nThe third-year quarterback has never missed a game in his NFL career, but has questionable a few times in 2023 due to knee and ankle injuries, as well as a stint last week in the NFL’s concussion protocol.\nThe Panthers have a lengthier injury report, although seven players were listed as full participants Thursday.\n#CARvsJAX Thursday injury report… pic.twitter.com/aIg0MQZTUo\n— Adam Caplan (@caplannfl) December 28, 2023\nThe most significant issue for the Panthers is the health of their secondary with cornerbacks Jaycee Horn and Troy Hill both missing another practice.\nArticles NFL Week 17 best bets: One wager to make for every team Doug Pederson: Jaguars 'still locked in and focused,' not tuned out Jaguars reveal uniform combination for Week 17 vs. Panthers",

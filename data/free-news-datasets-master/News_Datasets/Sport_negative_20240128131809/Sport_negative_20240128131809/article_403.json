    "text": "The first hours of Marcelo Moretti's government in San Lorenzo were not quiet. On Thursday, FIFA issued an inhibition due to the claim of Yeison Gordillo , former player of the Boedo club, for an old debt. Almost at the same time, a conflict broke out with another Colombian, Rafael Pérez , who declared himself free for non-payment, although the new president assures that he transferred the money on time.\nOn the scale of importance, an inhibition beats a casualty in the first team, but both are problems for the institution and for Ruben Darío Insua . On the one hand, today San Lorenzo is prevented from registering new contracts. And, to top it off, everything indicates that they are going to lose a key defender for the Galician.\nThe history with Gordillo goes back a long way. The midfielder, for whom the Ciclón had paid $1,200,000 for 80 percent of his move to Deportes Tolima, was considered free to play in the middle of last year due to unpaid debts.\nThe first intimation via Agremiados had been at the beginning of 2022, but the sequence was repeated in May. Finally, in August, the 31-year-old midfielder who currently plays for Velez reached an agreement with the previous management for a payment plan.\nGordillo played a year and a half with the Ciclón between 2021 and 2022. Photo: AFP\nHe had signed for 3 24/<> years, he was there for one and a half and had two more to go. Gordillo agreed to collect in installments what he owed plus three months of the <> months that lay ahead of him. However, that agreement was not fulfilled by San Lorenzo and the Colombian raised his claim to the FIFA offices.\nHow much is the debt? The exact amount was not disclosed but, according to Clarín , the figure exceeds one million dollars. Moretti and company have two options: either they pay to lift the inhibition or they try to open dialogue with the player to reach a new agreement. One way or another, the solution will have to be immediate if they want to strengthen the team ahead of next year's Copa Libertadores.\nAt the same time, Rafa Perez is looking for his exit although he has one year left on his contract and notified this past Wednesday that he is considered a free player for non-payment of a bonus debt of 110 thousand dollars.\nPerez issued a Dec. 12 request to be paid within 15 days. According to Barça's new leadership, there was time until Wednesday 27 to pay, the day on which part of the total was transferred to adjust to the law.\nRafe Perez does not plan to return to San Lorenzo. Photo: AFP\nHowever, Perez moved forward with Junior de Barranquilla, a club that wants to sign him as a free agent. In Colombia, they even report that the medical check-up has already been carried out and that their contract has been agreed. What is coming now will be a legal battle between the player and the Cyclone, although it is almost a given that he will no longer wear blue and red again.\nIn this regard, the arrival of Jhohan Romaña, another Colombian defender who last played for Olimpia and whose transfer belongs to Austin FC, is advanced, who would loan him out with an option to buy. Of course, the current inhibition will have to be lifted first.",

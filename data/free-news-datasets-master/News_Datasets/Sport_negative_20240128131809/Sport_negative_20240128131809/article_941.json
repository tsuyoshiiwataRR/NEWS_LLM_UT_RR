    "text": "Pakistan captain Shan Masood (L) gestures to his players on the fourth day of the second cricket Test match against Australia / Â© AFP\nMitchell Starc removed opener Abdullah Shafique cheaply Friday as Pakistan stuttered in their chase of an unlikely 317 to win the second Test in Melbourne.\nAt lunch on day four, they were 25-1 with the deficit down to 292, but Shafique was gone for four, caught by Usman Khawaja in the slips after a period of intense pressure.\nImam-ul-Haq was unbeaten on five at the break while skipper Shan Masood was not out 12, having survived an on-field lbw decision which was overturned on review.\nThe Pakistanis padded up after the hosts were all out in their second innings for 262, after resuming on 187-6.\nMir Hamza was the best of the bowlers with 4-32, while Shaheen Shah Afridi took 4-76.\nPakistan are targeting a first Test win on Australian soil since 1995, but it will not be easy.\nThe highest-ever successful run chase in the fourth innings of a Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was 332-7 by England in 1928, with scores over 300 rare.\nAlex Carey slammed 53 to help Australia build their overnight lead and quieten chatter about his form after losing his place in the one-day side to Josh Inglis.\nHe resumed on 16 after Australia had bounced back from 16-4 thanks to an attacking 96 from Mitchell Marsh, who was dropped on 20, and Steve Smith's gutsy 50.\nCarey, who made his first and only Test hundred in Melbourne a year ago, hit consecutive fours in his first over from Hasan Ali to build confidence.\nAt the other end, Starc lived dangerously and fell for nine with the impressive Afridi getting the breakthrough on a pitch still offering a bit for the bowlers.\nBaba Azam took the sharp chance at slip after Starc miscued a drive.\nPat Cummins made a breezy 16 but was caught behind by Mohammad Rizwan off Aamer Jamal, while Nathan Lyon crunched two straight fours off Jamal, then was bowled for 11 three deliveries later.\nCarey brought up his sixth Test half-century before being the last man out, lbw to Hamza.",

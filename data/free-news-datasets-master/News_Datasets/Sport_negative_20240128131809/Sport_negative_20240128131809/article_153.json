    "text": "Arsenal 0-2 West Ham: Tomas Soucek in the goals as Mikel Arteta’s side suffer Premier League title setback Arsenal missed the chance to go back top of the Premier League as they succumbed to a shock home defeat to an impressive West Ham side. David Moyes’ men got a goal in each half – from Tomas Soucek and former Gunner Konstantinos Mavropanos respectively – as they pushed themselves up to sixth, above Manchester United. Mikel Arteta threw on Eddie Nketiah and Emile Smith Rowe but to no avail. Arsenal slumped to their first home defeat of the season in the Premier League as Tomas Soucek scored a contentious opening goal to help a well-drilled West Ham earn a 2-0 win – their first victory in the top flight at the Emirates since 2015. Arsenal were denied the chance to return to the top of the table above Liverpool after VAR decided the ball was still in play when West Ham moved ahead against the run of play on 13 minutes. An Emerson cross caused havoc in the home defence as Jarrod Bowen reacted quickest to flick the loose ball back across goal for Soucek to slam into the empty net. A delay of three minutes was needed for referee Michael Oliver before VAR confirmed the goal after failing to find conclusive proof that the ball had gone out, as Bowen set up his team-mate for a fifth league goal of the season. Despite being pressed back for large swathes of the match, West Ham sealed the three points when former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos rose to power a header in off the bar from a James Ward-Prowse corner for his first Premier League goal on 55 minutes. David Raya saved a penalty kick from Said Benrahma at the death after Declan Rice had felled Emerson in injury time, but by then the points were already on their way to East London. David Moyes' side move above Manchester United into sixth in the table, while Arsenal remain two points behind leaders Liverpool at the halfway stage of the campaign. More to follow...

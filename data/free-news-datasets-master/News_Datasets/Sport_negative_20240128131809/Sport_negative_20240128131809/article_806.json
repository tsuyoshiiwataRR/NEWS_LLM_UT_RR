    "text": "India suffered an embarrassing defeat by an innings and 32 runs against South Africa in the first Test of the ongoing two-match series. In a game that finished inside three days at SuperSport Park in Centurion, Indian batters produced a shambolic show in both innings. Apart from KL Rahul’s 101 in the first inning and Virat Kohli’s 76 in the second inning, no one else was able to do justice with their talent.The Indian team, after getting an invite to bat first in the Boxing Day Test, could only manage to score 245 runs in the first inning and get all out in less than two sessions for 131 runs in the second inning. The poor show by Indian batsmen was heavily criticised by fans and experts of the game. But Indian skipper Rohit Sharma has come out in defence of his teammates and said that even though the batters did not perform up to the mark in the first Test, he was not ready to concede that they have trouble coping with the moving ball overseas.According to the 35-year-old batter, who was only able to score 5 and 0 in the first Test, there is no need to worry and criticise the batters because it is the same set of players who performed well in England and Australia in the last few years.\\\"There's no need to motivate them. They are all international cricketers. This performance is just one. Don't forget what we did in Australia and England. We won in Australia with our batting. We drew in England with batting and bowling. It's not like we don't know how to bat outside India. Sometimes the opposition plays better than you. It's not like they batted 110 overs and we couldn't even do that. You go and check the scorecards of the last four or five away tours we have done,\\\" Rohit said.\\\"Look at what KL Rahul did in the first inning. It is a perfect example of showing intent as well as respecting conditions. At the end of the day, he scored at a strike rate of 70, and he put the bad balls away. That is what we talk about intent.\\\"However, Rohit did criticise the poor bowling show by Indian pacers, who gave away more than 400 runs.\\\"This was not a 400-run wicket, and we gave up too many runs. We sprayed the ball all around, but it happens. One can’t depend on one bowler (Bumrah); the other three pacers also needed to perform their roles; we could learn from how South Africa bowled,\\\" Rohit said.\\\"Bumrah bowled well, and we all know his quality. All he wanted was a bit of support, which he didn’t get. That happens. All three tried hard, bending their backs, but it didn’t happen the way we wanted it to. But games like these teach you a lot as to what you want to do as a bowling unit,” the Indian captain added.",

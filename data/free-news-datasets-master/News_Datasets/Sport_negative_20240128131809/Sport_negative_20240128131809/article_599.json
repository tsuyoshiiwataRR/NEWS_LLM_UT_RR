    "text": "Wolves forward Fabio Silva has agreed to join Rangers on loan for the rest of the season. The 21-year-old cost Wolves a then club record £35million when he joined from Porto in 2020 and there were high expectations, but he has failed to make an impression in the Premier League and has had two loan spells away at Anderlecht and PSV Eindhoven. All parties hope the move to Scotland can kickstart the Portugal U21 international's career. Silva said: 'This first-half of the season things haven't gone my way at Wolves but now with this opportunity I want to give everything here. 'It is amazing, everyone knows I had other options and other clubs but when I saw the option of Rangers, I was very happy. It was my first option straight away because I want to win titles, to play at big clubs, to feel the pressure and to play in big competitions so I want to play for the fans and play with my teammates.'

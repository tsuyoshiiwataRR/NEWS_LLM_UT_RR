    "text": "The Miami Hurricanes' disappointing 2023 season came to a bitter end on Thursday afternoon as the once-storied college football powerhouse fell to Rutgers 31-24 in the Pinstripe Bowl. The loss drops the Hurricanes to 7-6 on the season. It's just two wins better than their 2022 season record, which landed at 5-7. Has Miami seen enough of head coach Mario Cristobal? Fans sure have. Over two seasons at Miami, Cristobal is 12-13 and continues to have a tough time learning football's simple lessons, like when to use a timeout and how to manage the clock with a lead. The only good news is Cristobal recruits at an elite level, having signed the nation's No. 5 class in the 2024 cycle. College football fans, however, are calling on Miami to move on from Cristobal after just his second season. \"Mario Cristobal’s Year 2 at Miami ends in a Bowl Loss to… Rutgers? Mario Cristobal is now 12-13 as Miami’s head coach. Several head scratching losses this season, and mind boggling decisions like not taking a knee against GT. At least they’ve got recruiting…,\" said College Football Report. \"Mario Cristobal will have two timeouts to use in the offseason after Miami loses a one-score game in which the Hurricanes had the ball last,\" said Barrett Sallee. \"It's official - the Mario Cristobal era in Miami is a complete FAILURE Mario was hired in 2022 to revive an average Hurricanes program... he proceeded to go 5-7 his 1st season, & now 7-6 with an embarrassing bowl loss to Rutgers in Year 2. His tenure so far has included a home blowout loss to Middle Tennessee, a major coaching blunder to lose to Georgia Tech, & the regression of a former Heisman Caliber QB in Tyler Van Dye... Miami usually won 8 or 9 games a season before he arrived, but with him in charge they've taken a step BACK Don't forget that Miami is one of the most well funded programs in NIL, & plays in a very winnable ACC conference... their boosters aren't getting the best return on investment,\" wrote Blue Bloods Bias. \"Miami is 44-4 with Mario Cristobal the player, and 12-13 with Mario Cristobal the HC,\" said RedditCFB. \"Wow, how is Rutgers manhandling them boys in the trenches? Nobody does less with more than Mario Cristobal. Elite con artist,\" one fan wrote. Year three of the Mario Cristobal era at Miami will ultimately prove pivotal. Another disappointing season and it could end up being his last with the Hurricanes.",

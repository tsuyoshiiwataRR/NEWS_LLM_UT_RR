    "text": "If the Pittsburgh Steelers don’t beat the Seattle Seahawks, the season is over. Pittsburgh’s three-game losing streak put them in this position and if they can’t find a way past the Seattle Seahawks, those three losses are going to loom large. The Steelers need to win both games and get help if they want to sneak into the playoffs .\nNFL pundits don’t have much faith in the Steelers to head out to the West Coast and upset Seattle. According to the smart folks over at NFL Pick Watch, 91 percent of NFL experts are taking the Seahawks. Fan picks are no better with 86 percent of the fan vote going to Seattle.\nPittsburgh found its groove on offense last week with Mason Rudolph at quarterback. However, Rudolph might not get the opportunity for a repeat performance as Kenny Pickett continues to make his way back from a high ankle sprain.\nMore Steelers Wire News Steelers try out nine offensive players, including two QBs Former NFL star suggests Russell Wilson to the Steelers Steelers shut out of list of 15 HOF finalists",

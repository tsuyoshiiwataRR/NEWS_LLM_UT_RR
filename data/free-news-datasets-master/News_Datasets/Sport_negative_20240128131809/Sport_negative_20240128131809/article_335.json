    "text": "In pictures: Arsenal v West Ham\nMikel Arteta mistakently stated that Arsenal are top of the Premier League after Thursday night's agonising defeat at home to West Ham . The Gunners boss was then corrected by an Amazon Prime reporter, who delivered the bad news that Liverpool were in fact top of the tree heading into another round of fixtures on New Year's Eve.\nRelated articles\nArsenal in new VAR farce as Gunners convinced West Ham goal shouldn't have stood\nArsenal transfer priority becomes clear in West Ham loss as David Moyes ends run Arsenal had the chance to regain top spot with a win over the Hammers, who arrived at the Emirates Stadium off the back of a 2-0 victory at home to Manchester United. But Arteta's men fluffed their lines under pressure from Liverpool, Manchester City and Aston Villa.\nTomas Soucek notched the visitors' opener inside a quarter of an hour, but there was more than a tinge of controversy surrounding whether or not Jarrod Bowen successfully kept the ball in play in the build-up. VAR found that there was not conclusive evidence to support overturning the referee's decision, which was to award the goal.\nThere were no such queries around the second of the night, with Konstantinos Mavropanos heading in off the crossbar against his former team, sparking rampant celebrations in the away end.\nDon't miss... Tottenham outcast Hugo Lloris 'in final stages' of agreeing back-door exit\nMikel Arteta addressed the media after Arsenal's defeat to West Ham (Image: Prime Video) Arsenal were unable to mount a dramatic late comeback, as they have done so often under Arteta. But the manager chose to look on the bright side after the final whistle - or so he thought - by incorrectly pointing out that his side were top of the table.\n\"What we need is to finish the actions better,\" he told Prime Video . \"The [players] have done it, they did it last year and we are where we are. We're top of the league so that means that the team does a lot of good things.\"\nBecome an Express Premium member\nSupport fearless journalism\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free\nGet super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial Read more...\nMan Utd sweating over '£17m transfer raid' just weeks after Erik ten Hag U-turn [GOSSIP]\nArteta 'blocks three January exits' as Arsenal boss risks souring relationships [REPORT]\nNewcastle told to 'aim higher than Eddie Howe' in debate about sacking manager [FEATURE]\nRelated articles\nArsenal ace Kai Havertz replaced by 16-year-old as Mikel Arteta gets adventurous\nPGMOL admit to VAR failure in Arsenal's West Ham loss as Gabriel Jesus poor READ MORE\nTransfer news as Man Utd receive Greenwood bid and Chelsea strike January deal The interviewer than had to awkwardly correct Arteta by pointing out that Jurgen Klopp 's Liverpool are currently leading the title race by a slender two-point margin.\nA costly home defeat will no doubt sting for the Gunners, particularly with the questions around Soucek's opener bearing many similarities to Anthony Gordon's controversial goal in the 1-0 defeat to Newcastle United in early November.\n\"They say it is not conclusive,\" Arteta said in his post-match press conference. \"It is just a shame that with the technology it is not that clear.\nTomas Soucek scored West Ham's controversial opener against Arsenal (Image: Getty) \"It is gone and there is not much we can do now. But if the technology we have is not good enough, what we have to do without that is win the game with the amount of situations we generated.\n\"We haven’t scored with 30 shots. I cannot imagine a game more dominant. Today it wasn’t enough to win the game. But the team deserved to win the game. We missed a lot of situations. But I love the players the most.\"\nRelated articles Dodge Ryanair excess luggage fees with this ‘perfect’ bag for less than £15 Arsenal duo blocking Liverpool transfer as Man City fear deal haunting Guardiola",

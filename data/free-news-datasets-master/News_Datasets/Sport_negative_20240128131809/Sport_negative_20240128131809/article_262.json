    "text": "When I started covering the Lions in 2014, I talked a lot about Ndamukong Suh. It was hard not to. He was in the final year of his contract and everyone wanted to know what his next move was going to be. Eventually that move was to leave the Lions and head to Miami. I thought I was done talking about him. Then 2023 rolled around. Here I am talking about him again for the fourth time this season. This time it's pretty fun because it's not about whether or not he's going to sign with the Lions this year. That question has been answered for sure. This time it's to remember the first playoff game I ever covered. You might remember that one. It actually might be one you try to forget. The Lions lost after a controversial picked up flag wiped out a pass interference call that would have allowed the Lions to potentially widen the gap on the scoreboard. Suh is still upset about that. He took some shots at the Cowboys on Instagram on Thursday. You might remember, again I know you're trying not to, that Suh was pretty distraught after that loss. He openly wept out of frustration in front of the media and you really can't blame him. I'm sure a lot of people wept that night. In this moment I do kind of wish he could play in this game. It's about time for some revenge.",

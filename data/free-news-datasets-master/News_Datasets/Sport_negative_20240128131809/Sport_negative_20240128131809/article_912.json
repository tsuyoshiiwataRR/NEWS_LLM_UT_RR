    "text": "2023-12-27 06:24:00 Returning from injury, Victor Wembanyama was unable to prevent the Spurs’ defeat against the Utah Jazz (118-130) on Tuesday December 26. Hit in the ankle before Christmas, the Frenchman posted a mixed performance with 15 points scored and 7 rebounds collected. Established as the pivot, Wembanyama started the match with a 3-point basket then a block on Kelly Olynyk, followed by an acrobatic alley-oop. To which were added 2 rebounds and 2 assists, all in 5 minutes. Rarely since the start of the season have we seen such ball movement in favor of the Frenchman. At the break, the Spurs, behind on the scoreboard (60-64), did not benefit from the efficiency of the interior (2.24m), with 10 points scored in 11 minutes. Afterwards, the Jazz adjusted, defended themselves better against Wembanyama, entrusting their best offensive player Lauri Markannen (31 points) with the task of reducing the influence of the Frenchman. A success. Wembanyama played 13 minutes in the second act but his effectiveness waned (2/7 on shots). “More consistency for some of my players” His teammates did not seem to be able to take over, the outcome could only be another defeat. A setback that annoyed legendary San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich. “It’s time to ask some of my players for more consistency. Otherwise, I will be forced to make changes,” he said. READ ALSO Basketball: Victor Wembanyama, first choice playerThe French player, drafted in first position last June, regularly displays certain qualities (18.5 points and 11 rebounds on average). The interior, however, has not yet found the key to relaunching the very young franchise. San Antonio has a string of setbacks, and has a largely negative record of 4 wins for 25 losses, making the Spurs the worst team in the Western Conference. The Texans will have a double confrontation to play before the end of 2023, against the penultimate Portland, on December 29 and 30. #Victor #Wembanyama #Spurs #lose",

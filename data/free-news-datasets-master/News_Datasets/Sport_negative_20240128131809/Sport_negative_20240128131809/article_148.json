    "text": "Arsenal missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League after a 2-0 defeat to West Ham at the Emirates Stadium. Tomas Soucek put David Moyes’ side ahead after Jarrod Bowen had set up his goal in controversial fashion in the 13th minute. As the England forward prepared to pull the ball back from the byline, it was unclear if it had gone out of play for a goal kick. However, VAR could not overturn the on-field decision as it did not have a compelling camera angle to overrule referee Michael Oliver.\nAdvertisement\nAs Arsenal chased an equaliser in the second half, former player\nKonstantinos Mavropanos headed in West Ham’s second goal from a James Ward-Prowse corner. Saïd Benrahma had his penalty saved by David Raya in stoppage time at the end of the second half, but the victory was already secure.\nThe defeat means Arsenal sit second in the league table on 40, two behind leaders\nLiverpool, while West Ham move up to sixth on 33.\nHere Art de Roché analyses the key Arsenal talking points from the match.\nIgnore VAR, Gabriel could have prevented goal\nWest Ham’s opener will long be a point of contention due to the confusion over whether the ball was out of play, but Arsenal should never have allowed the situation to reach that point.\nWilliam Saliba and Declan Rice were alert as the ball progressed up the flank, moving to right-back and centre-back respectively. But what cause the problem was Jarrod Bowen going untracked between Rice and Gabriel as the cross was played.\nThe miscommunication and panic that ensued between the Brazilian and Oleksandr Zinchenko could have been prevented if the whole defensive unit moved as one in that moment. Instead, swipes were taken at the ball and West Ham took advantage.\nPreventable goals have been a theme of Arsenal’s 2023. Throughout the calendar year, switching off at crucial moments has cost them. These mistakes only become more glaring because Arsenal give opposition teams so little in regards to building their own attacks. But these errors often feel like one of the main issues holding them back.\nTrossard can’t make up for Havertz absence\nThe one position of contention for Arsenal this season has been the left-sided No 8.\nKai Havertz has made it his own with improved performances in recent weeks, but with his suspension against West Ham, Leandro Trossard failed to pick up where he left off.\nAdvertisement\nThe 29-year-old has been used in that role earlier this season, but very little of what he tried came off. Early on he took up similar spaces to Odegaard which resulted in him either miscontrolling passes meant for his captain or rushing shots wide.\nFrustration grew as when he did start occupying the right areas, his execution let him down. Midway through the first half he pulled wide to left Martinelli drift inside, but he could not dribble when the ball reached him later in the move.\nThe moment that epitomised the frustration came at the end of the first half, however. After brilliant work from Declan Rice to give Arsenal a final attack in added time, Trossard was advancing with multiple passing options but shot high and wide. A half-time change would have been warranted but the fact this was not Arteta’s first change felt strange.\nThe Spaniard has spoken glowingly about Emile Smith Rowe recently. Ahead of the PSV draw, he said: “The way he’s done his rehab I haven’t seen him do it before like how he’s done it this time. You see the way his teammates reacted to his comeback which is really positive as well. The moment we can give him chances the better we’re going to be.”\nPushed on whether it was the midfielder’s physical or mental approach he was impressed by before West Ham, he added: “Both of them. It wasn’t the first time that happened and sometimes it’s not easy to start that process again. When he was getting some momentum and looking good again, he went through that in a really impressive way. Now it’s about putting it on the pitch when he gets the opportunity to do that. To perform and make a difference for the team.”\nSmith Rowe replaced Trossard on 78 minutes to one of the bigger cheers of the night and immediately caused an issue with a run in behind for an Odegaard cross. Havertz will likely come back in against\nFulham, but more thought needs to be put into who fills that slot when the German is not called upon.\nFrustration at lack of creativity\nArsenal showed promise in the opening exchanges.\nMartin Odegaard was the main thrust of this. Within the first five minutes, he had sprinted forward to regain possession in the final third, nutmegged a West Ham defender to keep Arsenal in a promising position and put on a shooting chance for Bukayo Saka with a smart backheel.\nAdvertisement\nBut once West Ham took the lead, the Norwegian was the only one who seemed to have any creative ideas.\n10 – James Ward-Prowse is one of only two Premier League players, along with Bukayo Saka (11), to have assisted 10+ goals across all competitions this season. Swing.\n[pic.twitter.com/ijaFSQKVu2]\n— OptaJoe (@OptaJoe)\n[December 28, 2023]\nFor a group of players who often seem to know what their next action is going to be before the ball reaches their feet, there was too much time being spent on the ball. Multiple touches without going anywhere and passes to slow the tempo rather than counter-attack frustrated the Emirates crowd.\nArsenal have proven they can cut through teams who decide to sit deep and defend their box (Sheffield United, Burnley and Wolves are examples), but they lacked the incisiveness of those performances.\nWhat next for Arsenal?\nSunday, December 31: Fulham (A), Premier League, 2pm GMT, 9am ET\nMarco Silva’s side have posed some problems since they were promoted in 2022 — Arsenal needed to rally after\nAleksandar Mitrovic opened the scoring at the Emirates 16 months ago, and Joao Palhinha’s late equaliser stunned Arteta’s side at the start of this season.\nRecommended reading\nHow ‘leader’ Declan Rice has exceeded expectations on and off the pitch at Arsenal Kroenke vs Usmanov – the Arsenal power struggle that led to a decade of drift Cult football boots – best of the 2000s: Mercurial Vapors, Total 90s, adiPures What must change in the new WSL era: ‘Fans don’t know whether they’re coming or going’\n(Top photo: IAN KINGTON/IKIMAGES/AFP via Getty Images))",

    "text": "Arsenal fans were left furious as Tomas Soucek’s goal for West Ham stood (Picture: Amazon)\nVAR did not rule out Tomas Soucek’s goal for West Ham against Arsenal on Thursday night despite the ball appearing to go out of play in the build-up.\nSoucek silenced the Emirates after just 13 minutes after he was left unmarked from Jarrod Bowen’s cross to smash his effort past goalkeeper David Raya.\nBut there was huge controversy surrounding the goal and a long VAR check ensued after referee Michael Oliver had awarded it to the visitors.\nThat’s because the ball appeared to go out of play before Bowen reached it – with VAR checking two angles before deciding that the goal should stand.\nJay Bothroyd, watching the match for Sky Sports, said: ‘It was so tight. From certain angles you couldn’t see it. It was a good move by West Ham, poor defending from Arsenal.\n‘The Premier League spend so much money on everything about football but then in these situations there’s one view.\n‘There’s no bird’s eye view, no view from the other side – that was too far away and couldn’t zoom in. They should have this sorted out already.\n‘Those are the details they need to work out. If that was out and you’ve given a goal that’s a poor decision on what they’ve seen.\n‘Those are the things everyone is frustrated with in football right now.’\nFormer referee Mark Clattenberg, though, speaking on Amazon Prime, has explained why the goal was not ruled out.\n‘The on-field decision is a goal, so they have to find conclusive evidence that the ball has gone out of play,’ he said.\n‘From the angles I have seen, the ball looks to be slightly in play.’\nThe incident marks the second time Arsenal have conceded a goal this season where there’s controversy over whether the ball went out of play in the build-up, after it occurred in their 1-0 defeat at Newcastle United earlier in the campaign.\nNever miss a beat throughout the season or transfer window with weekly Arsenal news updates, exclusives and analysis.

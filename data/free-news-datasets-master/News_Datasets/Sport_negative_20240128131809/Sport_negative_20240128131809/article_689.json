    "text": "HIBBING—The Hibbing High Schools basketball team left some points on the floor, and Mounds View took advantage of that en route to a 50-37 victory over the Bluejackets at the Hibbing High School Gymnasium Thursday. Hibbing had ample opportunity to pull away from the Mustangs, especially early in the first half. Mounds View was whistled for six early fouls, and the Bluejackets were in the bonus just eight minutes into the game, but they couldn’t take advantage of it. The Mustangs went scoreless for almost four minutes as well. “When we’re shooting free throws just two minutes into the first half, that’s something we have to take advantage of,” Hibbing coach Chris Hanson said. “We have to be aggressive by going to the hoop. “Give credit to them. They were able to adjust to the way things were going. I thought defensively we played well, but when you get those opportunities from the free throw line, those are the ones that tend to come back and haunt you. We have to do a better job with our confidence right from the start.” Hibbing did hold a 12-4 lead, but the Mustangs rallied back and took a 18-17 lead with 2:59 to play. They never looked back after that, taking a 23-19 lead into halftime. The Bluejackets’ shooting went cold for a while, which is what let Mounds View back into the game. “We had some good looks, but again, credit to them,” Hanson said. “They changed up their defense, and we had to adjust on the fly. I thought we did a nice job adjusting to that 1-2-2 that they did. “We had some nice looks, but that’s the game of basketball. Some of them fall, sometimes they don’t. They knocked down a couple of threes with the shot clock at one or two. That’s a difference maker just momentum-wise.” The Bluejackets did try to make a couple of runs at the Mustangs, but Mounds View was able to knock down some shots along the way to never let Hibbing back into the game. “For the majority of the game, when they made a shot, we did a nice job of responding,” Hanson said. “We cut those runs that they had shorter. We continue to learn. We continue to grow. “I’m proud of how we fought in that second half. They hit the shots they work on every summer. The muscle memory is there. That’s a goal of ours to get to that level where when the shot clock is running down on us, or when we get an open shot, it’s an opportunity for us to answer those shots as well.” Hibbing was led by Kate Toewe with 16 points. Jorie Anderson had 11, but the Bluejackets did leave a lot of points on the floor. “We get a couple of stops, but it’s unfortunate that we get one that goes through our hands, or we throw one or two away after we get a stop,” Hanson said. “Those are the points you hope to get. “We gave up a couple of offensive rebounds to them, then they find a couple of open shooters. It’s those second-chance points and fastbreak points that slip away from us that end up making a difference as well.” Mounds View was led by Bria Stenstrom with 23 points. Logan Kirk had 12.

    "text": "It doesn’t seem like anyone is interested in the\nOrange Bowl, and ticket sales reflect it. A recent report states that ticket brokers are having trouble finding attendees following a number of opt-outs and injuries on both sides.\nFlorida State and Georgia are two of the biggest brands in college football, but neither fanbase is excited about their postseason destination.\nThat’s because both had national championship aspirations heading into the season’s final week.\nGeorgia entered the SEC Championship Game riding a 29-game winning streak before falling to Alabama. That Crimson Tide victory was enough to give Bama the nod for the final seed in the\nCollege Football Playoff.\nThey received that bid over an undefeated Florida State team that entered its ACC title matchup ranked No. 4 in the CFP standings. Despite a win over Louisville, the\ncommittee decided to leave the 13-0 Seminoles out of the four-team playoff field.\nThat decision sent shockwaves throughout the sport, resulting in a flood of\nconspiracy theories, a College Football Playoff investigation, and a lawsuit involving the ACC.\nFans were rightfully peeved with their teams being left out of playoff consideration, especially on the Seminoles’ side. After all, FSU did all it could to land a bid, while the Bulldogs are 29-1 over their last 30 games.\nWith a national championship no longer on the table, the Orange Bowl has been deemed\n‘meaningless’ to both sides.\nA great deal of Florida State players will\nsit out of the contest, including projected starting quarterback Tate Rodemaker. The same is true for Georgia, who will be likely without Brock Bowers, among others.\nThat’s led to quite the predicament for ticket brokers.\nOrange Bowl ticket brokers hope to break even\nOutkick spoke to a ticket broker ahead of the Orange Bowl matchup, who said there wasn’t much interest, particularly on Florida State’s end.\nWe’ve seen a little bit of action from Georgia in ticket sales, but they’re just tired of traveling. From a Florida State standpoint, we definitely bought too much inventory. We thought the fanbase would be excited to at least see a matchup against Georgia, but we were wrong in a big way… I’m going to have my guys outside the stadium just trying to break even.”\nDespite the game being played in the state of Florida, it seems we’ll see a pro-Georgia crowd, though it doesn’t look like either side is chomping at the bit to attend.",

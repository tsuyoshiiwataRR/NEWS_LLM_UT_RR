    "text": "by WAKA Action 8 News Troy University is mourning the death of former women‚Äôs basketball player Ke‚ÄôAjia Williams of Montgomery.\nWilliams died earlier this month. She had previously attended Shelton State and Jeff Davis High School.\nThe Troy women‚Äôs basketball‚Äôs Sun Belt Conference opener against Georgia State scheduled for Saturday has been moved to Sunday at 1 p.m. in Trojan Arena so that players and staff can attend the funeral.\nWhen Williams was at Shelton State Community College from 2020-2022, she played both post positions for the Bucs during her career and helped the team win two regional championships. She was able to capture 8.2 points per game and six rebounds per game in her final season at Shelton State.\nTroy University says thanks to its partnership with The Vance Law Firm, Troy Athletics will not charge admission for the game due to the date change. All other events surrounding the game will remain in place, including the ESPN+ broadcast.\nOur thoughts and prayers go out to Ke‚ÄôAjia and her family. Ke‚ÄôAjia‚Ä¶ you are forever a Trojan and we will miss you alwaysüïäÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/4iq0KUERb8\n‚Äî Troy Women‚Äôs Basketball (@TroyTrojansWBB) December 27, 2023",

    "text": "Dallas Cowboys edge rusher Micah Parsons remains frustrated with he perceives as unfair treatment from NFL officials and continues to voice his displeasure over the lack of holding calls against him. Parsons is one of the league’s premier pass rushers and he joins Hall of Famer Reggie White as the only players in NFL history with at least 13 sacks in each of his first three seasons. But Parsons believes he would have many more than than 13 in 2023 if not what he believes have been obvious holds against them that have not drawn flags. He leads the NFL in quarterback pressures (97) and quarterback pressure rate (23 percent). But Parsons has drawn just two holding calls this season and none since Oct. 16 against the Chargers. He has now gone nine games and more than 36 quarters without a holding call and Parsons has had enough. Parsons has voiced his displeasure on his podcasts and after games. He almost lost his composure in last Sunday’s 22-20 loss to the Miami Dolphins when Parsons was flagged for a questionable roughing the passer penalty but endured a clearer obvious hold and possible hands to the face without a call from the officials. He aired his feelings out on social media and doubled down during a media session on Thursday. Parsons initially tried to down play the lack of holding calls. “It’s been long, you know? And I can say I’ve been to the quarterback quite a lot in that time, so it’s definitely frustrating sometimes,” Parsons said. “But at the end of the day, I kind of understand it comes with the territory.” But the more he talked, the more his true feeling came out. Parsons said the officials simply don’t understand his greatness and can’t treat him like other pass rushers. “To be honest, in the most humblest way ever, I don’t think there’s another rusher like me in the league,” Parsons said. “I don’t think there’s a rusher that runs as quick as I do. There’s not a rusher that does the things that I do. I mean, that’s on tape and I’m pretty sure other rushers can tell you that or whoever. So I think they put me on the same pedestal as other rushers, and we’re just all not the same. “You can’t compare me to a lot of other rushers at all. And how they scheme me versus how they scheme other rushers, it’s just not even the same. I don’t think they take that into [account] at all and I don’t think they realize I’m 4.3 coming off the edge versus some dudes might be 4.4 or 4.5, whatever.” Cowboys owner Jerry Jones came to his defense earlier this week. He said the NFL officials are holding Parsons back. “There’s no question that Micah [Parsons] is having restrictions that, if turned loose, would result in a sack of the quarterback,” Jones said. “They won’t call a holding penalty in a certain range of holding, usually, if they don’t think the player would’ve gotten to the quarterback to begin with. That doesn’t work for Parsons because he’s about to get there almost all the time. Anything that just limits him should be a hold.” Parsons has talked to the officials before and during games and has seen no recourse. What his not going to do is start flopping and failing to draw a call. “I think the refs understand I’m a good player. But they don’t understand the actual plays I can make with my speed and what I can control,” Parsons said. “I just keep it rolling, bro. It kinda is what it is. I’m not a flop guy. I’m not a guy that’s going to fake because I believe I can still make that play. I just got to keep playing through things. It’s adversity. It’s challenges. But I’m just going to keep going forward.” ©2023 Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Visit star-telegram.com . Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "text": "Kansas City Chiefs stars Patrick have been labelled as \"spoiled brats\" over their recent performances.\nThe criticism came from none other than Chiefs legend Dante Hall, who despite his relationship with the pair, did not hold back with his criticism.\n\"It's like my little kids running around here on Christmas Day,\" the 45-year-old said on 'Good Morning Football' . \"We got you a Christmas tree filled with presents, and you're acting like spoiled little brats. These guys know I love them.\n\"So, as a friend, as a brother, I had to call you out. This is not a good look. I'm watching the game with my kids, my daughter loves Patrick , and you're acting like that? C'mon, guys! Be better, and I think the team will be better.\"\nREAD MORE: Taylor Swift gets seal of approval from Chiefs heiress set to inherit Â£12.2 billion\nREAD MORE: Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld rumours fuelled as actress spotted at Buffalo Bills game\nHall's criticism of Mahomes and Kelce came after the Chiefs legend explained that the star quarterback needed to play like Tom Brady, mainly in how he approaches game situations and not forcing the issue.\nHe said: \"It's time to be 'Checkdown' Tom Brady. Falling in love with the swing route, the check-downs. These plays have been there for the taking and that's pretty much what we need to get to, right? Check-down, when it's there, take it. Don't look for the big play. Get a rhythm. If it's a fice-yard check-down, throw it to him.\"\nHall explained that the behaviour of Mahomes and Kelce, such as throwing their helmets and shouting at teammates and officials, might be contributing to Kansas City's struggles this NFL season. \"Body language is everything,\" said the former wide receiver. \"When you are screaming and yelling at your players, that permeates negativity.\"\nHe added: \"What you have had in your first five years, that poker face, we know we're going to win this in the end, that permeates positivity. Get back to being positive and not so negative on the sideline with your guys. Be better and I think the team will be better.\"\nShannon Sharpe also criticised the Chiefs' star duo after their loss to the Las Vegas Raiders. He suggested the team needs to get back to basics to overcome their current slump.\nWith only two games left, the Chiefs need to quickly figure out how to improve or their Super Bowl title defence could end prematurely.\n ",

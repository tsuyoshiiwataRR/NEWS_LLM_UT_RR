    "text": "2023-12-28 21:35:00\nThe penalty was awarded by referee Jasper Vergoote for a foul by Christian Burgess on Hugo Vetlesen. “The alleged play phases of Lazare and Vetlesen came from the belly,” Vergoote said in ‘Under Review’.\nClub Brugge snatched a 1-1 draw against Union in the 56th minute thanks to a penalty goal from Igor Thiago. However, it was not immediately clear why the penalty was awarded. “It was the most crucial and difficult decision of the match,” admitted Vergoote. “On the field, I see two accidental handballs. The phase of play continues and Burgess causes a violation of the penalty kick. I award it and I also communicate it to the VAR. The latter then looked at the phases possible hand play and saw that for Lazare and Vetlesen, the contact came from the stomach.\nRed card, tension in the tunnel, altercation with the assistant: tense end of the match between Union and Club Brugge\nSpokesman Frank De Bleeckere also spoke about the penalty shootout which took place last Saturday at Anderlecht-Genk. Bryan Heynen missed an 11-yarder for Genk, but teammate Yira Sor scored on the rebound. The latter seemed to leave too early, as did two Anderlecht players. The penalty should therefore have been taken again, but this did not happen at the VAR signal. Genk then filed a complaint. De Bleeckere said on Thursday that this complaint will be dealt with by the referees department on January 5. “Then the Disciplinary Board will make a decision,” he said.\n1703815117\n#Jupiler #Pro #League #referee #handplay #Lazare #Vetlesen #match #Club #Brugge #Union",

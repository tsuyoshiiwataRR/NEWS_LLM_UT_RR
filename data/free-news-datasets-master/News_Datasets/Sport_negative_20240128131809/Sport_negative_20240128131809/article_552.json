    "text": "VAR could not determine whether the ball had gone out of play before West Ham’s goal against Arsenal (Photo: Amazon Prime)\nGary Neville couldn’t help but troll Arsenal fans after the Gunners conceded another controversial goal during their match with West Ham.\nArsenal shockingly went behind early on at the Emirates on Thursday night after Tomas Soucek found the back of the net, but there was a long delay before the goal was given.\nVAR were checking to see whether Jarrod Bowen had kept the ball in play in the build-up to the goal, and as the camera angles couldn’t find conclusive evidence that it had gone out, it was given.\nIt did look incredibly close however, and bought back memories of the goal Newcastle scored in their victory over Arsenal earlier this season, which sparked Mikel Arteta’s infamous rant about referees.\nOn that occasion, the camera angles being used appeared to show the ball going out of play but nothing was conclusion, though it was later revealed from a different angle it had stayed in.\nNeville took time on Sky Sports to demonstrate how the situation had played out and after Arsenal fans began to fume over Soucek’s goals, he cheekily tweeted an image from that segment showing how the ball hadn’t crossed the line.\nSoon after, he responded to a Gunners supporter who replied to his tweet with: ‘You were the worst full back in the PL [Premier League]’.\nThe Manchester United legend replied: ‘Agreed but great at goal line technology’ before later adding: ‘On a positive note for Arsenal the front 3 are playing narrower and closer to each other to combine. They look dangerous!’\nFormer referee Mark Clattenberg, speaking on Amazon Prime, explained why West Ham’s goal was not ruled out, saying: ‘The on-field decision is a goal, so they have to find conclusive evidence that the ball has gone out of play.\n‘From the angles I have seen, the ball looks to be slightly in play.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nNever miss a beat throughout the season or transfer window with weekly Arsenal news updates, exclusives and analysis.

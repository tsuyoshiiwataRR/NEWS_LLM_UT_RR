    "text": "Getty Images Things are not going well for Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs right now. As the Chiefs' offense sputters, Kelce has taken some criticism, and former NFL tight end Eric Ebron is catching a few shots in the process.\nIn the Chiefs' 20-14 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders on Christmas Eve, Kelce caught five passes for 44 yards. In the aftermath of that defeat, Kelce has been the butt of some jokes online, including cracks about his performance slipping since his relationship with Taylor Swift began.\nOne fan joked on social media that Kelce has essentially been Ebron this season, and the latter tight end saw the post. Ebron had a good sense of humor about it but requested to be left out of the current discourse.\nLeave Me Alone ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ https://t.co/nGbeFR55L2\nâ€” Ebron85 (@Ebron85) December 28, 2023 To be fair to Ebron, he had a successful eight-year career at the NFL level. While Ebron may not have lived up to the billing of the No. 10 overall pick, he finished his career with 351 catches for 3,837 yards and 33 touchdowns. In 2018, Ebron went to the Pro Bowl as a member of the Indianapolis Colts when he tallied 750 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns.\nDespite his struggles this season, Kelce is still in a position to play for his third Super Bowl ring. The Chiefs can clinch the division this weekend with a win over the Cincinnati Bengals , and Kelce has shown a penchant for making big plays in the postseason.\nOur Latest NFL Stories NFL Week 17 expert picks, best bets, more Jordan Dajani â€¢ 16 min read Wilson: Broncos said change contract or get benched Tyler Sullivan â€¢ 2 min read NFL Week 17 injury reports: Lawrence, Waddle ruled out Tyler Sullivan â€¢ 11 min read Lawrence ruled out for Week 17 with shoulder injury Tyler Sullivan â€¢ 2 min read Russ to serve as Broncos backup QB vs. Chargers Week 17 Cody Benjamin â€¢ 3 min read Lamb 3 catches from new Cowboys mark; Irvin 'loves it' Garrett Podell â€¢ 6 min read Watch Now: Eric Ebron reacts to negative Travis Kelce comparison Austin Nivison 1 min read Week 17 picks, best bets from all of our experts Jordan Dajani 16 min read Bold predictions: Rudolph stays hot Garrett Podell 6 min read Flacco has Browns on improbable run Jonathan Jones 5 min read Playoff projections: Every team's chances John Breech 6 min read Prisco's picks: Ravens edge Dolphins Pete Prisco 6 min read Week 17 injury reports: Lawrence, Waddle ruled out Tyler Sullivan 11 min read Broncos bench Wilson: Landing spots for QB Cody Benjamin 4 min read These six teams can clinch a playoff spot in Week 17 John Breech 3 min read Belichick names his all-time team: Four Pats make list Jared Dubin 2 min read",

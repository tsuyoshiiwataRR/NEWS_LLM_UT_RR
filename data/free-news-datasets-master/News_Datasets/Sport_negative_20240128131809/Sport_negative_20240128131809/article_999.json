    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. — Avery Johnson threw for two touchdowns and ran for one, DJ Giddens rushed for 151 yards and scored twice, and Kansas State beat No. 19 North Carolina State 28-19 in the Pop-Tarts Bowl on Thursday night.Johnson, a freshman making his first start after Will Howard entered the transfer portal, threw for 178 yards, rushed for 71 and directed a 15-play, 72-yard touchdown drive in the fourth quarter that put the game away and closed out a solid season for coach Chris Klieman’s Wildcats (9-4).Quarterback Brennan Armstrong rushed for 121 yards and a touchdown and threw for 164 yards in his final game for the Wolfpack (9-4), who fell short of winning 10 games for the second time in program history.Giddens had a 37-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter, his only catch of the game, and ran for a 4-yard TD early in the second that made it 14-0.Kansas State led 21-7 late in the second quarter and 21-10 at halftime, but N.C. State rallied in the third quarter, thanks in part to some trickery. Trent Pennix ran for a 60-yard touchdown on a fake punt with 1:50 left in the period. But the 2-point try failed, allowing the Wildcats to maintain a 21-19 lead.Johnson and Giddens took over from there. Giddens had six rushes for 25 yards on a drive that took 7:24 off the clock and concluded with Johnson’s 8-yard touchdown pass to Jayce Brown with 2:48 remaining.Jacob Parrish intercepted Armstrong on N.C. State’s next play from scrimmage.Both teams ran successful fake punts.Kansas State punter Jack Blumer called his own number in the second quarter for a 30-yard gain that set up Giddens’ rushing TD.N.C. State had its biggest play on a direct snap to Pennix, a tight end, from the punt formation that he took all the way to the end zone.N.C. State’s lone 10-win season came in 2002, when it went 11-2 with Phillip Rivers at quarterback.N.C. State will have to replace Armstrong, a fifth-year senior who transferred from Virginia for his final season, and graduating Atlantic Coast Conference Defensive Player of the Year Payton Wilson.Kansas State can look forward to having both Johnson and Giddens back in 2024.",

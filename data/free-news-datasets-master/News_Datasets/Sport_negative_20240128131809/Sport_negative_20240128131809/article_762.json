    "text": "There are real fears that Australian cricket players will take T20 money over the chance to put on the baggy green, while other nations could stop playing the long form of the sport completely.\nWhile crowd numbers continue to dwindle at Test matches, T20 cricket continues to surge globally.\nIt received the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) seal of approval to be part of the 2028 Los Angeles Games while The International League T20 in the United Arab Emirates became the latest big money tournament in an already cluttered calendar.\nMajor League Cricket also launched in the United States, backed by Microsoft and Adobe. However it is the surge of franchise T20 cricket that could drive the final nail into Test cricket.\nSparse crowds have begun to plague cricket in Australia, with Marnus Labuschagne pictured in front of bays of empty seats against South Africa in January, 2023\nNathan Lyon took his milestone 500th Test wicket in front of bays of empty seats at Optus Stadium in Perth against Pakistan in the first Test\nSouth Africa has also struggled to bring the crowds in for their Boxing Day Test blockbuster against India – which they won\nThe owners of eight of the 10 Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises also own at least one team in another foreign competition, with that number set to expand in the coming years.\nIt would create a situation where players would need to choose between T20 riches or representing their nation, with no room in the schedule to do both.\nThat would mean only the most financially viable Test nations would be left standing, potentially meaning only Australia, England and India play the five-day game in the near future.\nIt is not fearmongering or hyperbole, it is a real fear, Australian Cricketer’s Association Todd Greenberg said.\n‘My message is, we’re under pressure,’ he told News Corp.\n‘Pressure might be a good thing, because it will lift all of our opportunities up and make us the best we can be, but other countries are really struggling,\n‘And we can’t play against ourselves. So I’d like to think that Test cricket is more than just Australia, England and India in 10 years’ time.\n‘We want to make sure that Pakistan and South Africa and New Zealand and others can continue to play against us.\n‘I worry that countries like South Africa and New Zealand in 10 years time may no longer be able to afford to have their best players playing and disappearing because of the push and pull of global leagues.\n‘So that is a concern. And I don’t think I’m being an alarmist. I think I’m being a realist.’\nAustralian Cricketers Association boss Todd Greenberg, pictured with his wife Lisa, believes Australia has to help battling nations stay relevant in Test cricket\nAt present, Australia has seen the likes of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and even renowned short-form specialist Glenn Maxwell shun the riches of franchise cricket to focus on their country.\nHowever with gun players turning down playing for their nation in other countries, Greenberg is aware that situation could change very quickly in Australia.\n‘We’re already seeing countries all over the world and particularly in New Zealand, South Africa, where that’s already happening,’ he said.\n‘And so my message is, it’s not happening here at the moment, and it might not feel like it’s gonna happen here at the moment, but it’s happening in other countries in our sport.\n‘So we’d be crazy not to think that those pressures aren’t going to be applied to us at some point in time. So we’ve got to have this conversation now. Make sure we’re ready,’ Greenberg said.\nMajor League Cricket in the United States is the latest T20 league to appear in an already cluttered calendar\nThe IPL continues to go from strength to strength and now franchises are looking to own international clubs – which could mean players are contracted all-year round\nGreenberg is not the only cricket identity forewarning the death of Test cricket.\nEnglish cricket icon David ‘Bumble’ Lloyd said the death of Test cricket would come within a decade back in 2022.\n‘Where will they put it? There’s no room for Test cricket as we know it, and my guess is that in future we will only see the iconic series: like the Ashes, England vs West Indies and England vs India,’ he wrote for Sportsmail.\nEngland cricket coach Brendon McCullum, who has been the architect of Bazball in a bid to revive Test cricket, also previously warned that the long-form of the game was at risk if England was not competitive.\n‘Test cricket has always been the pinnacle for me,’ he said in an interview with the ECB. ‘But the popularity of it has somewhat trended south of late.\n‘So if Test cricket is to not just to sustain but thrive it needs England playing an attractive brand of cricket which is competitive with Australia, India and New Zealand.\n***\nRead more at DailyMail.co.uk",

    "text": "There isn’t much good news on Thursday’s update for the New Orleans Saints injury report. While rookie safety Jordan Howden (illness) returned to practice after resting on Wednesday, starting right tackle Ryan Ramczyk (knee) and veteran safety Lonnie Johnson (knee) were still missing. It isn’t looking good for either of them as we approach Sunday’s matchup with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who could be without top defenders Carlton Davis (concussion) and Shaquil Barrett (groin).\nIf there’s a silver lining, it’s that several young draft picks are practicing on a limited basis for the Saints after having missed some time with injuries. Rookies Isaiah Foskey (quadricep) and Kendre Miller (ankle) have both been active this week, and defensive end Payton Turner (toe) is progressing well in his return from injured reserve. Win or lose, it would be great to see something positive from the three of them down the stretch.\nHere’s a quick look at Thursday’s injury report from both teams:\nArticles Ryan Ramczyk weighing options with career-threatening injury NFL Week 17 best bets: One wager to make for every team Will your local TV station carry Week 17's Saints-Buccaneers game?

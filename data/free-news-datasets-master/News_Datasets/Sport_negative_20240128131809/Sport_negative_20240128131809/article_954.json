    "text": "Brian Fluharty/Getty Images The Detroit Pistons looked poised to snap their 27-game losing streak with a huge upset over the Boston Celtics on Thursday. They held a 21-point lead late in the first half and went into the break with plenty of momentum. That lead didn’t last, however. The Celtics mounted the comeback and ultimately won the game 128-122 in overtime. Boston looked like it could win it in regulation, but the Pistons managed to send the game to overtime in the final seconds after Bojan Bogdanovic tied it up with a put back after Cade Cunningham’s missed three. Jayson Tatum had a chance to win it at the buzzer but came up short. Detroit’s losing streak is now at 28-games after blowing the huge lead. It was the first time this season that the Pistons had led by 20+, but ultimately the huge lead wasn’t enough for them to hold on to. NBA University @NBA_University Pistons are the only team in the NBA who haven’t led by 20+ in a single game this season\nCeltics are the only team in the NBA who haven’t trailed by 20+ in a single game this season\nDetroit led Boston by 21 in the first half of tonight’s game, snapping both streaks… Following Detroit’s embarrassing blown lead, NBA fans didn’t hold back, trolling the Pistons on social media. Now the Pistons sit at 2-29 with their last win coming Oct. 28 against the Chicago Bulls. It’s not clear what it will take for Detroit to snap its embarrassing losing streak, and the blown lead just adds insult to injury during the dreadful stretch. The Boston Celtics overcame a 21-point deficit and raised their home record to 15-0 by beating the Detroit Pistons 128-122 in overtime Thursday night.The Piston CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - DECEMBER 26: Coby White #0 of the Chicago Bulls controls the ball against the ...

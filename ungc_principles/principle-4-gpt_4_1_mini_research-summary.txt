# UN Global Compact Principle Four: Labour â€“ Elimination of Forced and Compulsory Labour

Businesses must uphold the elimination of **all forms of forced and compulsory labour**, ensuring that work is freely chosen without coercion or penalty.

---

## Core Definition

- **Forced or compulsory labour**: Any work or service exacted under the menace of penalty, without voluntary consent.
- Payment or wages do **not** negate forced labour if consent is absent.
- Workers must be free to leave employment according to established rules.

---

## Key Forms of Forced Labour to Recognize

- **Slavery** (including hereditary or descent-based)
- **Bonded labour/debt bondage**: Work to repay debts under coercive conditions
- **Child labour** under abusive, non-consensual conditions
- **Physical abduction or sale of persons**
- **Physical confinement** at work sites or detention
- Forced labour of prisoners without supervision or consent
- Labour imposed for ideological, political, or punitive reasons
- **Exploitative practices** such as forced overtime or withholding wages
- Requirement of **deposits or personal documents** for employment
- Use of **physical or psychological violence** to maintain control
- Restrictions on **freedom of movement**
- **Deception or false promises** about work terms
- Induced indebtedness through falsified accounts or inflated charges
- Threats of denunciation to authorities for irregular workers

---

## Why Businesses Should Care

- Forced labour violates fundamental human rights.
- It undermines societal development by limiting skill-building and education.
- Results in lower productivity, insecure investments, and slower economic growth.
- Causes loss of income and basic necessities for workers and their families.
- Forced labour risks can arise not only in direct operations but also through **suppliers, contractors, and business partners**.

# UN Global Compact (UNGC) Principle Three: Labour

**Core Focus**: Businesses should uphold the **freedom of association** and the effective recognition of the **right to collective bargaining**.

## Key Requirements

### Freedom of Association
- Respect the right of all **employers** and **workers** to freely and voluntarily establish and join groups for the promotion and defense of their occupational interests.
- Ensure that both workers and employers can set up, join, and run their own organizations without interference from the State or other entities.
- Maintain a climate free of **violence**, **pressure**, **fear**, and **threats** to enable workers to make free decisions.

### Collective Bargaining
- Engage in a **voluntary process** where employers and workers negotiate terms and conditions of work.
- Participants include employers or their organizations and trade unions or representatives freely designated by workers.
- Adhere to the **principle of good faith**, which requires:
  - Genuine and constructive negotiations.
  - Avoidance of unjustified delays in negotiations.
- Note that good faith does not imply a pre-defined level of bargaining or require compulsory bargaining.

## Implementation Guidance

### In the Workplace
- **Respect** the right of all workers to form and join a trade union of their choice without fear of intimidation or reprisal, in accordance with national law.
- Implement **non-discriminatory policies** regarding trade union organization and activities.
- Provide workers’ representatives with appropriate facilities to assist in developing effective collective agreements.
- Do not interfere with the activities of worker representatives; allow practices such as:
  - Collection of union dues on company premises.
  - Posting of trade union notices.
  - Distribution of union documents.
  - Provision of office space for union activities.

### At the Bargaining Table
- **Recognize** representative organizations for collective bargaining.
- Use collective bargaining as a constructive forum to address:
  - Working conditions and terms of employment.
  - Restructuring and training needs.
  - Safety and health issues.
  - Grievance and dispute settlement procedures.
  - Family and community welfare.
- Provide necessary information for meaningful bargaining.
- Balance dealings with the most representative trade union to ensure smaller organizations can continue to represent their members.

### In the Community of Operation
- Consider the role of representative national employers’ organizations.
- Take steps to improve the climate in labour-management relations, especially in countries lacking adequate institutional and legal frameworks for recognizing trade unions and collective bargaining.

## Importance for Companies
- Establishing genuine dialogue with workers' representatives fosters understanding and resolution of issues.
- Freedom of association and collective bargaining lead to constructive dialogue, enhancing productivity, incomes, and profits.
- Guarantees representation through a "voice at work" supports sustainable growth and secure investment returns, bridging the representational gap in global work arrangements.

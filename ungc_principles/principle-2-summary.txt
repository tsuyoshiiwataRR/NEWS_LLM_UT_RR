# UN Global Compact Principle Two: Human Rights

**Core Focus**: Businesses must ensure they are not complicit in human rights abuses.

## Definition of Complicity
- **Complicity** involves being implicated in human rights abuses perpetrated by others, including companies, governments, or individuals.
- The risk of complicity is heightened in areas with **weak governance** or widespread human rights violations, but exists in all sectors and countries.

## Key Requirements
- **Respect Human Rights**: Align with Global Compact Principle 1 and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
- **Avoid Complicity**: Implement systematic management approaches to human rights, including due diligence processes that cover business relationships.

## Elements of Complicity
1. **Act or Omission**: A companyâ€™s action or inaction that facilitates or legitimizes human rights abuses.
2. **Knowledge**: The company must be aware that its actions or inactions could assist in committing human rights abuses.

## Context of Allegations
- Allegations of complicity can arise in various contexts:
  - **Direct Complicity**: Providing goods/services known to be used for abuses.
  - **Beneficial Complicity**: Gaining benefits from human rights abuses without direct involvement.
  - **Silent Complicity**: Inaction in the face of systematic abuses.

## Business Rationale
- **Moral Responsibility**: Upholding human rights is ethically imperative.
- **Growing Importance**: Human rights issues are increasingly prioritized due to:
  - **Globalization**: Expansion into regions with poor human rights records.
  - **Civil Society Growth**: Increased influence of NGOs and accountability organizations.
  - **Transparency and Accountability**: Demand for ethical business practices.
  - **Crime**: Potential complicity in international crimes.

## Actionable Guidance for Companies
- **Human Rights Assessment**: Evaluate risks in countries of operation.
- **Explicit Policies**: Develop policies protecting human rights for employees and supply chains.
- **Monitoring Systems**: Establish tracking mechanisms for policy implementation.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Maintain open dialogue with civil society and other stakeholders.
- **Leverage Utilization**: Use influence to mitigate human rights abuses; explore ways to increase leverage.
- **Security Arrangements**: Ensure security practices do not contribute to human rights violations.

## Recommended Actions to Avoid Complicity
- Respect international guidelines for the use of force.
- Establish safeguards for any support provided to security forces.
- Condemn systematic human rights abuses publicly and privately.
- Consult stakeholders during pre-investment and post-investment stages.
- Raise awareness of human rights issues within the company.
- Identify high-risk functions linked to human rights abuses.
- Conduct human rights impact assessments for proposed investments.
- Identify internal risks related to human rights in post-investment scenarios.

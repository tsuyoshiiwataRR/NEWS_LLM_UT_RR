# UN Global Compact Principle Seven: Environment – Precautionary Approach

**Core Focus:**  
Businesses should adopt and support a **precautionary approach** to environmental challenges, taking preventive action in the face of scientific uncertainty to avoid serious or irreversible environmental harm.

---

## Key Requirements and Obligations

- **Apply precaution when there is reasonable suspicion of environmental harm**, even if full scientific certainty is lacking.
- Recognize that deciding on an **“acceptable” level of risk** involves:
  - Scientific and technological evaluation
  - Economic cost-benefit analysis
  - Political and public acceptability considerations
- Implement precautionary measures **as long as scientific information is incomplete or inconclusive** and the risk to environment, health, or safety is considered too high.
- Prioritize **prevention over remediation** to reduce long-term costs and risks.

---

## Business Rationale

- Early action to prevent environmental damage is **more cost-effective** than later remediation or treatment.
- Sustainable production methods yield **higher long-term returns** than those that deplete resources or degrade the environment.
- Improved environmental performance reduces **financial and reputational risks**, important for insurers and investors.
- Investing in **research and development of environmentally friendly products** offers significant long-term benefits.

## Implementation Guidance for Companies

### Policy and Governance

- Develop a **code of conduct or practice** affirming commitment to health and environmental care.
- Establish **company guidelines** for consistent application of the precautionary approach.
- Create a **managerial committee or steering group** to oversee risk management and precaution in sensitive areas.

### Risk Communication and Stakeholder Engagement

- Maintain **two-way, transparent communication** with stakeholders early in the process.
- Communicate potential risks and uncertainties clearly to consumers and the public.
- Use diverse engagement mechanisms such as:
  - Multi-stakeholder meetings
  - Workshops and focus groups
  - Public polls
  - Digital and printed media channels
- Provide **complete information on risks** and respond proactively to enquiries and complaints.

### Collaboration and Research

- Support and participate in **scientific research**, including independent and public studies on environmental risks.
- Collaborate with **national and international institutions** addressing precautionary issues.
- Join **industry-wide initiatives** to share knowledge and manage precaution, especially for products or processes with high uncertainty or potential harm.

---

## Relevant Standards and Frameworks

- Principle 15 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, which underpins the precautionary approach.
- Risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication methodologies as systematic tools for implementing precaution.

---

**Summary:**  
Businesses must integrate a precautionary approach by proactively managing environmental risks despite scientific uncertainty, emphasizing prevention, transparent stakeholder communication, governance structures, and collaborative research to minimize harm and promote sustainable development.

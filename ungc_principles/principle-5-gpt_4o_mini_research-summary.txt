# UN Global Compact (UNGC) Principle Five: Labour

**Core Focus**: Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of **child labour**.

## Definition of Child Labour
- **Child labour** is distinct from **youth employment** or **student work** and is a violation of human rights.
- Defined by international instruments, it encompasses all girls and boys under **18 years of age**.
- Acceptable work varies by age and development stage, with specific guidelines provided by ILO conventions.

## Minimum Age for Admission to Employment or Work
| Type of Work       | Developed Countries | Developing Countries |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Light Work         | 13 Years            | 12 Years             |
| Regular Work       | 15 Years            | 14 Years             |
| Hazardous Work     | 18 Years            | 18 Years             |

## Worst Forms of Child Labour (ILO Convention No. 182)
- **All forms of slavery** (trafficking, debt bondage, forced labour, use in armed conflict)
- **Prostitution and pornography**
- **Illicit activities** (drug production and trafficking)
- **Harmful work** (endangering health, safety, or morals)

## Importance for Companies
- Association with child labour can damage a company's **reputation** and **brand image**, particularly for transnational companies.
- Child labour negatively impacts children's development and future workforce skills, leading to a cycle of poverty and under-skilled workers.

## Rights of Children
- Children have distinct rights, including protection from **economic exploitation** and dangerous work.
- Companies must address child labour sensitively to avoid pushing children into more exploitative situations.

## Actionable Guidance for Companies

### In the Workplace
- **Identify** regions and sectors with a higher likelihood of child labour.
- **Adhere** to minimum age provisions of national laws and international standards.
- **Implement** age verification mechanisms in recruitment.
- **Avoid** blanket policies against hiring under-18s to not exclude eligible youth from decent work.
- **Remove** children found in the workplace and provide viable alternatives.
- **Influence** subcontractors and suppliers to combat child labour.
- **Develop** mechanisms to detect child labour.
- **Ensure** wages for adults consider family needs.

### In the Community
- **Collaborate** with other companies and organizations to address child labour industry-wide.
- **Participate** in task forces or committees focused on child labour.
- **Support** educational and vocational training programs for working children and their parents.
- **Launch** health and nutrition programs for children removed from hazardous work.

By following these guidelines, companies can contribute to the **abolition of child labour** within their sphere of influence.

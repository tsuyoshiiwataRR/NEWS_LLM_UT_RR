# UN Global Compact Principle Nine: Environment  
**Core Focus:**  
Businesses should actively encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies that protect the environment, reduce pollution, and promote sustainable resource use.

---

## Definition of Environmentally Sound Technologies  
- Technologies that:  
  - Protect the environment and are **less polluting** than previous alternatives  
  - Use resources more **sustainably and efficiently**  
  - Increase recycling of wastes and products  
  - Manage residual wastes in an **environmentally acceptable** manner  
- Include:  
  - Cleaner production processes and pollution prevention technologies  
  - End-of-pipe and environmental monitoring technologies  
  - Know-how, procedures, goods, services, equipment, and organizational/managerial methods  
- Aim to reduce:  
  - Operating inefficiencies  
  - Emissions of environmental contaminants  
  - Worker exposure to hazardous materials  
  - Risks of environmental disasters  

---

## Business Rationale for Adoption  
- **Resource efficiency:** Reduces raw material use and increases operational efficiency  
- **Innovation and competitiveness:** Drives new business opportunities and enhances market position  
- **Long-term benefits:** Provides economic and environmental advantages through cleaner, more efficient material use applicable across industries

## Implementation Guidance for Companies  

### Operational Level Actions  
- Modify production processes or manufacturing techniques  
- Change input materials to more sustainable options  
- Redesign products or components for environmental performance  
- Reuse materials on-site to minimize waste  

### Strategic Level Actions  
- Develop and implement a **corporate policy** on environmentally sound technologies  
- Provide transparent information to stakeholders on environmental performance and technology benefits  
- Redirect research and development towards **design for sustainability**  
- Utilize **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** to evaluate environmental impacts of new technologies and products  
- Conduct **Environmental Technology Assessments (EnTA)** to guide technology choices  
- Integrate environmental criteria into investment decisions and supplier/contractor sourcing policies  
- Collaborate with industry partners to promote access to the **best available technology**  

---

## Relevant Standards and Frameworks  
- **Agenda 21 of the Rio Declaration**: Defines environmentally sound technologies  
- **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)**: Tool for assessing environmental impacts throughout a productâ€™s life  
- **Environmental Technology Assessment (EnTA)**: Evaluation framework for environmental performance of technologies  

---

**Summary:**  
Principle Nine requires businesses to promote and adopt technologies that minimize environmental harm by improving resource efficiency, reducing pollution, and supporting sustainable production. Companies must implement both operational changes and strategic policies, leveraging tools like LCA and EnTA, to foster innovation and share best practices within their industries.

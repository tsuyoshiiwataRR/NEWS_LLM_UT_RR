# Principle Five: Labour

**Core Focus**: Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of **child labour**, recognizing it as a violation of human rights.

## Definition of Child Labour
- **Child Labour**: Exploitative work that deprives children of their childhood, dignity, and education.
- **Distinction**: Child labour differs from **youth employment** or **student work**; it is defined by international standards.

## International Standards
- **ILO Conventions**:
  - **Minimum Age Convention No. 138**: Establishes minimum age for employment.
  - **Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention No. 182**: Prioritizes the elimination of the worst forms of child labour for all children under 18.

### Minimum Age for Admission to Employment or Work
| Type of Work      | Developed Countries | Developing Countries |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Light Work        | 13 Years            | 12 Years             |
| Regular Work      | 15 Years            | 14 Years             |
| Hazardous Work    | 18 Years            | 18 Years             |

### Worst Forms of Child Labour (Convention No. 182)
- **Includes**:
  - Slavery and trafficking
  - Prostitution and pornography
  - Illicit activities (e.g., drug trafficking)
  - Work harmful to health, safety, or morals

## Business Responsibilities

- **Human Rights**: Children have distinct rights, including protection from economic exploitation and access to education.

## Actionable Guidance for Companies

- **Wage Consideration**: Ensure adult wages meet family needs.

### In the Community

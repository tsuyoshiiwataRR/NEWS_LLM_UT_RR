# Principle Ten: Anti-Corruption

Businesses should work against **corruption** in all its forms, including **extortion** and **bribery**.

## Core Focus
The tenth principle commits UN Global Compact participants to avoid corruption and proactively develop policies and programs to address it internally and within supply chains.

## Key Requirements and Obligations

## Importance of Anti-Corruption
- **Trust and Confidence**: Erosion of trust among investors, customers, and the public due to business ethics scandals.
- **Corporate Governance**: Increasing focus on anti-corruption as part of corporate sustainability and reputation management.
- **Risks of Inaction**:

  - **Reputational Risks**: Companies face damage to reputation from accusations of malpractice, regardless of legal outcomes.
  - **Financial Costs**: Corruption leads to significant economic losses, undermining business performance and public resources.
  - **Internal Trust**: Unethical behavior can erode staff loyalty and the overall ethical culture of the organization.

# Principle Seven: Environment

**Core Focus**: Businesses should adopt a **precautionary approach** to environmental challenges, prioritizing prevention over remediation.

## Key Requirements and Obligations

- **Adopt Precautionary Measures**: Implement cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation, even in the absence of full scientific certainty.
- **Systematic Risk Management**: Apply risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication systematically when there is reasonable suspicion of harm.
- **Evaluate Acceptable Risk Levels**: Consider scientific, economic, and political factors when determining acceptable levels of risk related to environmental, health, and safety standards.

## Implementation Guidance

### Business Considerations

- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Recognize that early action to prevent environmental damage is often more cost-effective than remediation.
- **Long-Term Investment**: Invest in sustainable production methods to ensure better long-term returns and reduce financial risks.
- **Research and Development**: Engage in R&D for environmentally friendly products to achieve significant long-term benefits.

### Action Steps for Companies

- **Develop a Code of Conduct**: Create a code that confirms the company's commitment to health and environmental care.
- **Establish Guidelines**: Formulate guidelines for consistent application of the precautionary approach across the organization.
- **Create Oversight Committees**: Set up a managerial committee to oversee precautionary measures and risk management.
- **Engage Stakeholders**: Foster two-way communication with stakeholders to transparently share information about uncertainties and potential risks.
  - Utilize multi-stakeholder meetings, workshops, focus groups, public polls, and various media for effective communication.
- **Support Scientific Research**: Collaborate with national and international institutions to support independent research on environmental issues.
- **Join Collaborative Efforts**: Participate in industry-wide initiatives to share knowledge and address precautionary measures related to high uncertainty and potential harm.

By adhering to these principles, companies can effectively integrate a precautionary approach into their operations, thereby enhancing their environmental performance and reducing associated risks.

**Note:**  
- Each pattern is designed to capture both direct violations (e.g., "employs child labor") and indirect violations (e.g., "fails to adopt human rights policy," "neglects due diligence").  
- The "To look for" examples illustrate sentences or statements that should trigger extraction under the pattern.  
- The "To ignore" examples illustrate sentences that mention similar entities or topics but do not indicate violations and thus should not be extracted.
